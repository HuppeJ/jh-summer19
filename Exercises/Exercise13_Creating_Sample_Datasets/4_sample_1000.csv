You tick yes if you are diabetic. T1 and T2 are the only choices and there is no option for entering the HbA1c or any other option.

Think of it as my body storing up the ability/strength/energy (but don't get energy confused with calories!) to deal with carbs on the odd ocassion. But if it is bombarded with carbs daily, it does not have the time to recover between bouts, and my BG creeps up. A spike never fully recovers back to normal pre-carb levels, and the next low (ish) intake of carbs causes another spike, with the original spike only half recovered.

On the back of my result being a score of 32, ny GP arranged a second HbA1c test and said he would adjust my medication downwards if it came out at a similar level. When I rang my GP practice for the result, I was told it was 'normal' and I had to ask for the specific score. It was 32 but they advised again that their system said this was normal. When I said that ny GP had already said he would adjust my medication if it was 32, I was asked to ring again when another colleague was in. Again they said it was showing as normal but, when I advised of my previous discussion wiyh my GP and that 32 for someone with diabetes could include variation lower and higher, they arranged for my GP to ring me. After discussing it with him he has adjusted my medication from 2x Alogliptin per day to 1 x Metformin per day, and for me to be retested in December to check the effects.

As for lows I can safely say my hypo awareness is good, but I definitely don't fit in with expected ranges. I know when my BS falls below around 3.5 but it really doesn't stop me from doing anything. I've had readings of around 1, which I won't lie in saying I felt good, but it hardly stopped me from doing something about it. I find it strange to think about a hypo is in the terms that a lot of people describe (i.e. if it's below 4 youre in serious danger, sorry doesn't seem to work that way for me). If I can still test by BS and do something about it, I'm not too concerned. Generally when I get a really low reading I'm being lazy, as I already know its low but check my BS to confirm (very rare, virtually never will I think I'm ok when I'm not) What annoys me is when someone reads a text book and tells me how I should react based on the average person or a study. I'm not suggesting that lows should be ignored. Far from it, I aim for 4-6 like most others do, but I really don't care if my BS is 3 or 7, but I do something about it and get it closer to what I want it to be. I believe it's more to do with how YOU feel and react than it is to worry about what a reading tells you that you should feel like. If you're newly diagnosed then air on the side of caution, but my advice is to be sensible and do what works for you.",

I have only had to show my letter once and have taken close to 100 flights since my type 1 diagnosis but there is somethings some nervousness about carrying sharp items. I confess I pay on this a little when I check in - the airline staff asks if I have any sharp items in my hand luggage, I say yes, watch their look of panic as I hestitate before mentioning the diabetes and see them visibly relax. I usually bring my sharps home with me but this would depend on how long you are away. I dont carry an official sharps container: I just put them in an empty drinks bottle which I decant when I get home. The used sharps can go in the hold on the way back without any problems. Have a wonderful trip in NZ. I admit I am a tad jealous.",

I wanted to find another way of describing what diabetes is like. I got frustrated after changing to a low carb diet and worrying how I would explain this to people. I could just say I'm diabetic but then they want to know why I can't have carbs/starches and so on. To me, there are lots of people who are on different diets, don't eat this, don't eat that and I never question them when they say, "" I can't tolerate dairy or bread or yeast, tomato puree - whatever, you get the idea. So, this is me - I can't tolerate carbs because I am extremely sensitive to sugar in all forms and that's just the way I am and I know what works for me. For some reason, this has helped me come to terms with the whole ""being a diabetic"" thing. I like to be different and not follow the crowd and this is just my way of expressing it. I even think it's a bit like an allergy in some ways. Of course, we're all intolerant for different reasons. Some of us can tolerate carbs, some of us can't. Some of us can eat dairy, some of us can't, what of it?!!",

Have you been peeing loads or lost weight recently? In my non professional opinion being 25 and not overweight it is unlikely you are T2. Make sure you doctor checks your urine for ketones as again most T2's do not have ketones in their urine at diagnosis. The main test to distinguish between T1/T2 or the other forms of diabetes such as LADA (T1.5) is a c-peptide test which will measure the amount of insulin you are producing. As you don't fit the normal criteria for T2 I would ask the doc for one of those along with a proper hBA1c test which will give an average blood level over the past 3 months. Good luck!

Some people make the mistake of thinking that taking pills will sort out diabetes, but it usually only has a limited effect. The best course of action to reduce blood sugar is to eat a low carb diet. Many people on here eat a Low Carb High Fat diet to effectively manage their blood sugars. Intermittent fasting is another way to help reduce blood sugars and help regenerate the body through the process of autophagy. You do get people who are in denial about high blood sugars. My diabetes nurse told me that many of her patients still add sugar to their tea and eat a lot of high carb junk food. Small surprise that such people require more and more medication and may suffer from diabetic complications such as eye problems or nerve damage. In the UK there are about 20 operations a day for amputations as a result of diabetic complications from neuropathy caused by prolonged high blood sugar which causes nerve damage and slow healing. Diabetes can result in about ten years less life expectancy if you don't get it under control. However, if you do get it under control then you should avoid serious complications and have a normal life expectancy. The important thing is to get a glucose meter and use it to check before and two hours after eating to see which foods spike your blood sugar. If they do raise blood sugars a lot, then stop eating them.",

I would also like to thank you for your custom to date which is appreciated. I am sorry for any distress caused to you or your family with regards to our request for a 'fit for travel certificate', it was certainly not my colleague's intention to cause offence either to you or your son. Health and safety is of paramount importance to us and this is why, when we are made aware by customers that one of their party has a condition which could potentially affect them whilst onboard, then we have a duty of care to ask for a 'fit for travel certificate', where appropriate. Whilst it is true that the Captain is not a doctor, his is the ultimate authority onboard and his decision is final. However before making such a decision, behind the scenes there will be consultation with the Chief Medical Officer, who is a doctor and a very senior officer who has overall responsibility across the fleet for medical issues. On this occasion, having had the relevant discussions I am happy to confirm that your son will not need a certificate. However I take your point that there is little clarification regarding this issue in our literature or online. I will now discuss this further with the Passenger Services Manager and our Communications Manager to see where we can make matters clearer for our customers. I would like to thank you for bringing your concerns to our attention, as feedback such as yours is essential in helping us to improve our services.

Good idea to show weight with skin on since you can do that when preparing your work lunch or picnic etc. Skinned version is just before you eat at home when scales are handy.

My husband has been diabetic for 18yrs and has, according to his mother, always had problems with agression when hes is close to a hypo. From my experience of him, the last 10yrs have been inproving, more so the last 5yrs. I find with experience of his temperament in relation to his blood sugar i can tell in advance that his levels are dropping. He changes quickly and in its extreme, when I have only seen it once, he lashes out. Although thankfully not at me! I just wanted to give you my oppinion from the other side as you could call it. I now see it as my 'job' to watch for these things. I married him, so as a result its my duty to take care of him, as he does me. You wouldnt marry a musician and expect not to hear music. So when you marry a diabetic you take on their life too. I think, your wife should be able to see these symptoms and realise its not your fault. She can notice these things before you do. But, with the risk of contradicting myself, she must find it incredibly hard and a huge responsibility. I can see, from the other side of the fence, why she has left. But also why she shouldnt. As a by-stander you feel incredibly helpless. The realisation that it has gone too far and you cant help anymore is almost unbearable. Seeing the man you love in a hypo is terrifying, frustrating, upsetting and more on top. Sometimes the emotions run too high and you do things you wouldnt do normally. I would try to talk to your wife. Maybe with both your sides of the story things can be sorted out I hope things go well for you, and I wish you good luck with your appointment. Sarah x",

I am a firm believer in the overflow phenomenon, as evidenced by the fact that it can take a very long time to bring wayward blood sugars under control - eating low carb for a day and going for a jog does not do this, so I strongly disagree that we only have glucose in the blood, glycogen in the muscles & liver, and thats it. In fact it doesnt even make sense, since every cell in the body can burn glucose, not just blood cells. With that in mind, my own personal feeling is that eat to the meter carries a connotation of topping up the glucose in the body rather than making intensive efforts to drain it all out. I appreciate that this a personal perspective and others are entitled to see things from a different angle, but certainly Id be comfortable asserting that the entire body needs purging of glucose. To me that is the big picture - the long game.","britishpub said: I've never ""eaten to my meter"" and I have always thought that the advice often given to do so was unhelpful, mainly for the reasons given above.

I was invited by my Operations manager at the time to try for an HGV licence. & I am also fully hypo awair. Including nights. I respectfully declined the offer. (To a very supportive manager.) Not wishing to rock the ""springs"" on my current driving entitlement.. Which inturn may have affected other future job prospects? Now I agree with you that the admin at DVLA don't live our life. Though, there maybe (I belive.) a host of medical experts ""advising"" at DVLA too. All they are looking at is a form on a desk in an office. Hopefully, someone else can clarify concisely where you stand on this issue... I personally come from the standpoint of ""KISS."" (Keep it simple for the stupid.?) I seal all my forms that way ticking the relivant boxes without elaboration of support. With the kindest regards & respect. I feel your frustration. I felt I could have handled the roll, even if it was to ""shunt"" vehicles around the yard or cover sickness absentees...","Craig1978 said: Well a little bit of backstory to this. This all came about because I got asked to apply for a HGV licence for my job at the start of the year. I've had 15 years of trouble free driving till now. I filled in all the relevant paperwork and had my medical, no problem so far. I then got asked to attend a medical at my current doctors, again no problem. My Doctor highlighted the fact that my annual reviews were behind, hence the current review this year. I passed the eyetest with no issues at all. I had another note on my record for non attendance of Retinal eye screening, but as I have had regular eye tests and screening done at my very good opticians, I didn't feel the need to waste anyone's time in the NHS and they were advised accordingly, although it still goes down as a 'no show'! On the application form, which is where I think things have started to go wrong, I have stated that I have had a few hypoglycaemic episodes, non requiring intervention, but just simply cases of overexcersion maybe, that I felt coming on, and dealt with (Maybe I am being too honest and they are not actually 'episodes'). I think they have taken this too literally and think that I am regularily on the verge of collapse - which is no where even close to the case. I have fulfilled all the other requirements otherwise. My application for the HGV licence was refused as I didn't have the required 3 months worth of Glucose readings on a relevant meter. I tried to explain to them that I hadn't set the correct date and time on my current meter as, as far as I was concerned upto the point of applying for a HGV licence, I only used the meter for my own use, and date/time to me were irrelevant, and I am under no opligation to record readings for everyday life/car driving. I accept the readings are required for HGV purposes, and otherwise there would have been no problem. Then I recieve a letter revoking my car licence on the grounds of my poor understanding of Diabetes control and recognising symptoms of a Hypo??? Complete rubbish. The letter says that I can then reapply for my Licence provided that I have not had a Hypo requiring another persons assistance in the last three months - which I never, ever have had. I can say that I have had low blood sugar levels, as described above. There seems to be a total contradiction with the DVLA website and my letter. Sorry for the long post, this is the situation I find myself in now, and I hope this may help people in a similar situation or anyone who has gone through similar themselves. Click to expand..."

It genuinely isnt as bad as youd think. As it stands Ive now had 4sets of standard medical retina team laser on both eyes- this was at most uncomfortable but I always found the doctor doing it to be watching and attentive to this. Unfortunatly, the laser in my right eye wasnt as successful as theyd hoped (its worse) leading to a big massive (according to one of my hospital letters ) vitreous heammorage which led to me being unable to see out of half my right eye. This led to a referral to a vitro retinal team who initially did aggressive laser the same principle as standard but lots more of it and higher power. Ive had this now to both eyes twice (Im at the stage of if I need more its likely to begin effecting my pheripheral vision which as yet thankfully is completely present). Ive been offered numbing injections for this laser but have always managed with just drops- I did find that it felt as if Id been kicked in the head repeatedly for afew days on one eye but then on another this was more like a toddler kick - so this does hurt more (eg. Couldnt keep eye open and sunlight killed!!) but again this is much more aggressive form of laser- and its not disasterous by any means. Normally- with the standard laser- Ive had to adjust the brightness of my phone screen etc but Ive been perfectly fine to return to work afterwards. They say to take some paracetamol and ibuprofen before anyhow- although I dont it may help for you.

Food preservation may also include processes that inhibit visual deterioration, such as the enzymatic browning reaction in apples after they are cut during food preparation. Many processes designed to preserve food involve more than one food preservation method. Preserving fruit by turning it into jam, for example, involves boiling (to reduce the fruits moisture content and to kill bacteria, etc.), sugaring (to prevent their re-growth) and sealing within an airtight jar (to prevent recontamination). Some traditional methods of preserving food have been shown to have a lower energy input and carbon footprint , when compared to modern methods. [1] Some methods of food preservation are known to create carcinogens . In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization classified processed meat, i.e. meat that has undergone salting, curing, fermenting, and smoking, as "" carcinogenic to humans"".

Click to expand... Whilst I agree with you that carbs are ABSOLUTELY the issue for diabetics, in part. I would also agree with the OP that fats are an additional important issue for those of us with high cholesterol. We must adjust our diet and/or medicate to address both issues for better health. It SEEMS counter-intuitive to increase fats if high cholesterol is present. I accept that this attitude is prevalent as a result of the medical profession over some decades ago deciding, on not much evidence, that fat was the enemy and the cause of heart disease. However, evidence is slowly emerging that this premise may be wrong, and that carbs may be the culprit, or what I think is even more likely, (and this just my opinion), that the combination of high fat AND high carb in the western diet is the real killer. Even so, insufficient evidence-based data exists at the present time to convince me to fully embrace the LCHF lifestyle. I think a healthy diet should be balanced ... not HIGH in some things and LOW in others, but moderate where possible in all things, although this is more tricky for diabetics because of the BG issue. So until the evidence is irrefutable that carbs is the ONLY issue, I'm hedging my bets. :crazy: Daibell said: Reducing carbs is necessary for most of us to help with lower blood glucose. This is not a surprise as Carbs are rapidly turned to glucose in the blood. Click to expand... Agreed, although I would qualify that by saying that some carbs are converted to glucose quicker than others. Daibell said: Reduced carbs may also help reduce cholesterol and/or improve the good form. Click to expand... I'm still not convinced on that one - see above. I note your use of the word 'may' in that statement - are you hedging your bets too? I found that exercise increased my HDL, so it's not all about the carbs. Daibell said: The impact of fats on the body continues to be argued but are not as harmful as thought back in the 60s/70s. Whether you do or don't reduce fats will depend on your calorie needs having already reduced the carbs to a smaller or larger extent. Click to expand... Yes, but there's insufficient evidence as to the efficacy of a high fat/low carb diet. Certainly not enough to effect a change in the attitude of the medical profession that FAT causes heart disease. Until further research is done in the area of diet, and the effect of the balance of carbs, proteins and fats etc., then this area will remain something of a black art. Anything else is anecdotal. I don't think it's quite as simple as just lowering carbs and upping fat. I have noticed that a number of people on the forum have said that following a LCHF or VLCHF diet has reduced their cholesterol. But as we are all different, who's to say it works for everyone? More research is needed. I reduced both carbs and fat to lose weight after my T2 diagnosis. This worked well for me and I now have a BMI in the normal range. Since reaching my target weight, I have increased both carbs and fat a little at a time, whilst keeping an eye on my BG, and have reached a level I can live with, which suits me, and keeps my weight stable. However, a recent test revealed that l have a total cholesterol of 6, albeit the HDL, trigs & ratios are very good - enough to convince my GP that statins are unnecessary at the present time. If I were to do as you suggest, and reduce my carbs further to reduce my cholesterol, I will inevitably start to lose weight again, which I don't want - unless I also increase my fat intake to satisfy my current calorie needs. I suppose I could instead increase my protein intake, but that may bring it's own problems. I now never eat more than 130g carbs per day ....and usually less than 100g. I enjoy my diet, which is important so that it's sustainable in the longer term. Although BG-wise this carb level suits me at present, and keeps my weight stable, it has not reduced my cholesterol. I don't worry about fat .... however, I would say that my fat intake is lowish to moderate. I am not convinced that decreasing my carbs further and increasing my fat intake would improve my cholesterol, and until I can see some compelling evidence that to do so would make a significant difference, I'm not (yet!) inclined to test that hypothesis. I am instead, currently experimenting with foods in my diet as it is now, which may lower cholesterol . e.g. oats and continuing with exercise, whilst keeping an eye on overall calories. I do have an open mind on this subject, but have other things I would like try first! I have a diet that works for me in every respect except my total cholesterol level. I would be very grateful if you could direct me to any evidence based research that shows that LCHF diets will reduce cholesterol. regards, Elle",Daibell said: Fats are not the issue but carbs are for diabetics.

I'm not a T2 diabetic and I don't need to lose weight (but like most people I have been on diets before!) so my opinion isn't from experience as person with T2. The first thing I saw I didn't like 'How to lose 20lbs of weight in 30 days without exercise' As some one with diabetes you have to look for something you can sustain for a long time, not a quick fix and exercise is brilliant for decreasing insulin resistance. Having said that the elements of the diet seem to be quite 'conventional' Proteins in the form of egg whites with one whole egg for flavor, chicken, beef Pork Starches in the form of legumes like lentils and dried beans plus a variety of veg. The starches are what are called low gi ie they are absorbed more slowly into your body and so don't have a dramatic effect on the blood glucose (things like bread made from processed flour,mashed potatoes and white rice may in any quantity, raise your glucose levels rapidly and to high levels)Indeed this is very much the type of diet I have seen advocated my a French diabetes doctor (I live in France), his opinion was that legumes should form the basis of starches eaten but that it was difficult to get people to eat many of them. As to whether it would work for you, if you think you would enjoy it, then try it. It would be best if you were able to test your blood gucose levels before and after some of your meals. That way you can look at the rise and see if it is within limits. Unfortunately many people with T2 find it difficult to get strips. I would suggest, if you are able that exercise is also very important. It doesn't necessarily have to involve getting sweaty at the gym. Gardening, walking and even some forms of housework are good exercise.",

As others said could be a rogue test. Maybe if your friend is worried she could test without having anything to eat or drink other than water.,

Once you've become accustomed to that, with the help of your carb counter book you can add even more variety and even up your carbs a bit if you want to eat more than 25g. I sometimes go up to about 70g per day but never more than that. It's not impossible, even if low-carbing, to eat ready meals. I always have some in the freezer for those days when maybe I have no time to cook. BUT - you must read the labels, go for the ones that are really low carb (less than 10g of carb per half pack is my criterion), and don't eat more than 1 a week 'cos it's an expensive way to eat. And they're still a bit junky 'cos of preservatives and stuff - but useful to have in! My breakfasts are omelettes or bacon & eggs, lunch usually a salad - chicken or tuna mainly, sometimes smoked mackerel, tomorrow corned beef 'cos I really fancy some. Corned beef has 1 gram of carb per 100g. Sometimes I have cold meat, cheese or hard-boiled eggs for breakfast, but usually when it's warmer. For tonight's supper I've eaten about 150g of rare breed fillet steak, cooked very slowly in the oven with butter, olive oil and garlic, and served with green beans - probably about 5 grams of carb all told, and I'm pleasantly full and won't get hungry again tonight. (I don't always eat like this - fillet steak is a rare treat! I had a roast duck earlier in the week which is also a rare treat - you can tell I just got my pension!) For supper tomorrow I shall cook some meaty sausages (1 gram of carb per sausage - read the labels!) in the steak juice, served on mashed cauliflower instead of potato, with maybe a bit of grated cheese on top. Again, v low carb. And my blood glucose will stay like a rock in the range 5 - 6.5, and I shall lose weight despite the fat! Shopping does take longer 'cos of all the label reading. You will get used to it, you'll even enjoy it, and we're all in it together, so let us know how you go on. Keep testing!

Being slim is one indicator of T1 together with blood sugar that can't be controlled with all the usual tablets. Sudden unexpected weight loss adds to the possibility of LADA. I've been down the LADA route myself. I had the two tests for it done privately. C-peptide which measures your insulin is a good indicator. GAD tests for antibodies. A negative GAD does not prove you aren't LADA; mine was negative and in my case I suspect a virus. There are those who say LADA has to be due to antibody attack. I don't agree with that view and would say that any destruction of the beta cells makes you T1 (LADA) as the cause doesn't matter - the result and treatment is the same. So, make sure your HBA1C is acceptable within NICE guidelines and if it's too high ask the GP for the two tests. Are you on various tablets?",

It's the sustainable part that is most important to my mind as for many of us LCHF must be a permanent lifestyle change rather than a shorter term diet. And it depends both on what each of us needs to eat to bring our glucose levels and/or weight down, and how we are able to handle managing our diet long term at that level, so you need to find your own balance. Eating a slightly higher level of carbs is going to be better than being over ambitious and going too low and (maybe continually) falling off the wagon, but if you're managing now and feeling well on it then you're doing just fine!

While my main training plan starts in November I am currently running 12k twice aweek and pushing 15k on a Friday. My main problem apart from my age is acid reflux or that's what I have been told it is by various docs. If I describe then maybe some one can advise what they think it might be and how best I can find relief, any help will be very gratefully received. As soon as I start running I have the feeling of trapped air in the centre of my chest,p its a constant pain, I continually burp and if I can get enough air up the pain goes and I run really well. If I can't the pain stays and my running seems to be affected. If I start too quickly and don't get the air up first I really struggle for the duration of the run. If can somehow sort this out the whole training thing will be much easier as its not much fun knowing you will struggle from the first step to the last. I have had a lot of tests, including an endoscope, scan, and many variants of anti reflux medication but nothing seems to work. I am type 2 diabetic currently taking Pioglitazone 15mg/ Meformin 850mg twice a day, Gliclazide 80mg, 2 in the morning and 1 in the evening , 15mg of Lansoprazole once a day, Ramipril 2.5g, once a day, Atorvastatin 20mg once a day",

I see in your first post that you were diagnosed back in April of this year. this would mean you are probably experiencing some ""honeymoon period"" issues -- where your pancreas is still sort of spluttering a bit of insulin now and then and making things a bit unpredictable. you say you are not allowed to give a correction after your breakfast and before lunch as you are only diagnosed 7 months it sounds as though your diabetic nurse is just being cautious for your safety. I would certainly recommend that you have another chat with her soon. I would also ask her about going on a carb counting course ( usually called DAFNE ) - dose adjustment for normal eating. do you have a 1/2 unit pen for your fast acting insulin ? this can be great for people on lower doses and more sensitive - as they can dial in 1unit , or 1.5unit or 2unit and so on. it is a way of being more precise. finally -- Diabetes is tough to get your head round -- there is so much to take in and it seems fairly lonely at times.

As far as I know there is no such service specifically for people with diabetes, however, these services do exist, I think they can be accessed via the council, if he's in East Surrey it's probably a really bad service, because they wouldn't spend money on that sort of thing. But often people in power, and people working in the NHS do have power over patients, will behave a lot better when they know someone else is watching, it sort of changes the balance of power. Which is why a complaint is good, it alters the balance of power.

Well all type 1 diabetics have to take insulin shots; you might not know but the essential difference between type 1 and type 2 is that type 2's produce some insulin, but may not always be producing enough, whereas type 1's essentially produce no insulin. Some type 2's eventually become type 1, or, like me, are diagnosed with type 1 straight away. The problem I have (as I have put in my post viewtopic.php?f=15&t=7191 ) is that I'm not sure how to adjust my insulin levels now that I am eating less carbs! You are right that if you don't get enough energy from carbs, your body automatically produces ketones to break down fat from your body into energy. It's for this reason that the Atkins diet (and similar low carb diets) are such a popular choice...you can't help but lose fat! You have raised an interesting point though; remember, my body doesn't produce insulin, it only uses the insulin I inject to give me energy. So any excess won't make my body produce ketones. What produces the trace amounts of ketones for me is exactly the same reason for a non diabetic..it's a form of ketosis. Now there's a totally different situation for diabetics where your body produces ketones because long term you aren't injecting enough insulin. What happens (to the best of my knowledge) is that as you aren't injecting enough insulin for the carbs you are eating, your body assumes that you don't have enough energy coming in, so again it produces ketones to get energy from the fat in your body. The problem for diabetics in this case is that as you aren't having enough insulin, your sugar levels are high and you feel thirsty, because you have alot of sugar in your blood and the only way to reduce it (without enough insulin) is through passing urine. Remember, insulin isn't energy itself, it's what the body uses to create energy for all the cells in your body. And whether you need insulin for the fat that the ketones break down, I don't know. Does anyone have any idea?",

Your brain needs food and water to function. Without it, it goes into shutdown mode.... You need a balanced diet.. With the food that you are eating then it would be really difficult for any healthcare professional to come up with a diagnosis of say coeliac, ins, gallstones etc. Your sleeping longer length of times will be because your body is telling you it can't cope mentally or physically with the lack of vitamins and minerals that you are giving it. This in turn seems to be leading you in a downward spiral.... Partners and family can only take so much to be honest. Having a partner in bed sleeping long lengths of time isn't nice, and people do not recognise the impacts that they ate having on others around them... Carers (not saying your partner is a Carer) have huge amounts of pressure put on them. Family members are normally the unpaid carers in this world.

For those who aren't aware: I had previous issues with (what I considered to be) dawn phenomenon, and previously had to give myself a 1-2unit injection nearly even morning or I'd see a a jump to 10+ without even touching a bite of food. I believe it was @tim2000s who suggested that it might not be dawn phenomenon and that I should consider a change in my basal injections. To answer your question: the new approach is working GREAT and I rarely have to give myself a morning bolus anymore. HOWEVER, I have made other necessary changes as well. It seems my morning blood sugar increases were largely attributed to eating healthy (25g+) amounts of protein just before bed. While that satisfied my hunger, the theory is that my body converted the excess protein into glucose (gluconeogenesis) only to be released by my liver in the mornings when I woke up. I increased my morning basal injection (from memory I think it was 1-2 units), try not to eat so much protein just before bed, and I try to get at least 3-4 miles of running in everyday (in addition to my heavy weight lifting). The running is sometimes a pain in the a**, but it has done wonders for keeping my insulin requirements and blood sugar readings low (in a good way of course). In contrast, if I do have a big meal the night before, I'm likely to get the morning spikes and will need to give myself a small (~1u) bolus. My insulin needs also change significantly (as much as 50%) during the weeks I'm less active.",GrantGam1337 said: I see you have now switched to a staggered split dose of Levemir rather than your previous 1-2u QA correction on waking to counter DP.

Recently my 4 year old son has become quite disruptive and i thought he was one of thoses kids that had a bad reaction to too much sugar etc so we tried for a couple of weeks to cut out the sugar sweets etc etc but now im thinking its maybe made it worse. He also needs so much sleep we thought that was why he was behaving badly as he was sleepy. Today my mum and i were discussing his behaviour and she thought that he seemed like he was lacking something and causuing the behaviour and she mentioned diabetes (shes a nurse). He seems to just get really crazy and cant get him to listen and he seems in a sort of world of his own. My grandad had type 2 diabetes but as far as i know that is the only one in the family. Should i just take him to the dr to get checked out or does this not sound like diabetes at all? Thanks in advance for your advice.,

Has anyone done any further blood tests to establish why I have type of diabetes yet? A nurse can do the same and possibly even a pharmacist. However as you are getting readings it seems you have mastered the mechanics of the meter. Only other points are timing of tests and clean samples. Wash and dry your fingers first to avoid contamination (not always visible). Stab at the edges not on the very tip or centre of the pad. Itll hurt less and leave less soreness. If blood is slow to flow warm hands first and try windmilling your arm around a bit first. You can also milk your finger before the prick from palm end towards the tip and gently after if necessary. Try not to just squeeze the tip though. Timing wise standard times are on waking, immediately before a meal and 90 mins to 2 hrs after. Ideally less than a 2mmol rise and ideally under 7.8mmol on the later reading. https://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes_care/blood-sugar-level-ranges.html Your levels are still quite high. Have you made any changes with regards to eating carbs? As you are not on any medications yet for the diabetes it should be quite safe to do so. If you are type 2 it will definitely help sort you out. If you are type 1 as yet unmedicated then whilst it wont solve the problem it may help keep a bit of a lid on it til you are and the testing should mean you see an scary rises that need immediate help.",ColinS said: I am probably not using the Meter properly (Not been told how and when to use it) i will ask the Dr to explain when and how to take blood tests when i see him.

But it's crucial to good control if you're on insulin. I weigh my food eg pasta to make sure I get the carbs right. I usually have the same amount of carbs for a particularly meal. What I mean by that is, say, if I was going to have pasta with a homemade tomato sauce, I'd have the same proportion of sauce, weigh out the same amount of pasta - and then I'd know the carbs were thevsame each time. So I wouldn't have to keep counting carbs every time I ate that meal because I'd already know how many carbs were in it. For recipes, I work out the carbs per portion and write that in the recipe book.

Anything made with dough or fruit or something will be high in carbs, and that does add up to the numbers you experienced. (Without the walk they probably would've been higher, so that walk was a good call!) I've tried antidepressants since I was 13 years old. They gave me migraines every single day for little over a year. (My shrink called me an obstinate quitter. I was puking my brains out daily, couldn't go to school...). Also, something that wasn't known then, in the time where prozac was still hailed as a miracle-drug: kids in puberty get more suicidal on prozac. That stuff made me very positive about death. I barely survived that, and have the hospitalrecords to prove it. Later, as an adult, I tried anti-depressants again, with various medicatons. When I finally found one that didn't give me migraines and allowed me to sleep, my eyesight got worse. My eyes hurt like heck. And then I found out my rheumatologist never put on record that I have Sjgrens, because I never should've been put on that antidepressant because it could've cost me the use of my eyes.

BASIC INFORMATION FOR NEW MEMBERS Diabetes is the general term to describe people who have blood that is sweeter than normal. A number of different types of diabetes exist. A diagnosis of diabetes tends to be a big shock for most of us. Its far from the end of the world though and on this forum youll find over 150,000 people who are demonstrating this. On the forum we have found that with the number of new people being diagnosed with diabetes each day, sometimes the NHS is not being able to give all the advice it would perhaps like to deliver - particularly with regards to people with type 2 diabetes. The role of carbohydrate Carbohydrates are a factor in diabetes because they ultimately break down into sugar (glucose) within our blood. We then need enough insulin to either convert the blood sugar into energy for our body, or to store the blood sugar as body fat. If the amount of carbohydrate we take in is more than our bodys own (or injected) insulin can cope with, then our blood sugar will rise. The bad news Research indicates that raised blood sugar levels over a period of years can lead to organ damage, commonly referred to as diabetic complications . The good news People on the forum here have shown that there is plenty of opportunity to keep blood sugar levels from going too high. Its a daily task but its within our reach and its well worth the effort. Controlling your carbs The info below is primarily aimed at people with type 2 diabetes, however, it may also be of benefit for other types of diabetes as well. There are two approaches to controlling your carbs: Reduce your carbohydrate intake Choose better carbohydrates Reduce your carbohydrates A large number of people on this forum have chosen to reduce the amount of carbohydrates they eat as they have found this to be an effective way of improving (lowering) their blood sugar levels. The carbohydrates which tend to have the most pronounced effect on blood sugar levels tend to be starchy carbohydrates such as rice, pasta, bread, potatoes and similar root vegetables, flour based products (pastry, cakes, biscuits, battered food etc) and certain fruits. Choosing better carbohydrates Another option is to replace white carbohydrates (such as white bread, white rice, white flour etc) with whole grain varieties. The idea behind having whole grain varieties is that the carbohydrates get broken down slower than the white varieties and these are said to have a lower glycaemic index. http://www.diabetes.co.uk/food/diabetes-and-whole-grains.html The low glycaemic index diet is often favoured by healthcare professionals but some people with diabetes find that low GI does not help their blood sugar enough and may wish to cut out these foods altogether. Read more on carbohydrates and diabetes LOW CARB PROGRAM: http://www.diabetes.co.uk/low carb program Eating what works for you Different people respond differently to different types of food. What works for one person may not work so well for another. The best way to see which foods are working for you is to test your blood sugar with a glucose meter. To be able to see what effect a particular type of food or meal has on your blood sugar is to do a test before the meal and then test after the meal. A test 2 hours after the meal gives a good idea of how your body has reacted to the meal. The blood sugar ranges recommended by NICE are as follows: Blood glucose ranges for type 2 diabetes Before meals: 4 to 7 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 8.5 mmol/l Blood glucose ranges for type 1 diabetes (adults) Before meals: 4 to 7 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 9 mmol/l Blood glucose ranges for type 1 diabetes (children) Before meals: 4 to 8 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 10 mmol/l However, those that are able to, may wish to keep blood sugar levels below the NICE after meal targets. Access to blood glucose test strips The NICE guidelines suggest that people newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes should be offered: structured education to every person and/or their carer at and around the time of diagnosis, with annual reinforcement and review self-monitoring of plasma glucose to a person newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes only as an integral part of his or her self-management education Therefore both structured education and self-monitoring of blood glucose should be offered to people with type 2 diabetes.

I've had Type 1 Diabetes since I was 11, I'm now 23 and I'm a fitness/dance instructor so I'm extremely active but I do enjoy a good take-away! I enjoy anything from a McDonalds or KFC to an Indian meal or my favourite - Nandos! I have large protions due to the amount of calories I burn (and I always have a huge appetite!) and although I don't have take-away's often I always have quite large portions of food for my evening meal. I do have small breakfasts, lunches and snacks which include fruit, veg and fish when I have time to cook it but reading your comments has made me realise maybe I should change my take-away habits... I like to have chocolate or a milshake when I go to the cinema too as I'm sure most people will, could all of this be doing more damage than I've realised...??? Thanks in advance for any replies",

I have never been able to go that low... my brain used to feel like having a ""low carb flu "" for 14 years so I have a hard time facing going through that again on purpose... but that said , when my daughter in some months is moving away from home Ill try to go that low again... or more often.. many type 2 can get totally healthy blood glucose normal numbers if they count all their grams of carbs in a day and stay under 100 grams in total, Some can even do it on 150 grams of carbs in total... this is of cause what we all want to strive for ; getting back to normal healthy numbers and not have to fear our future and all the horribly scaring diseases and conditions that a constantly raised blood glucose do create over time. Do you count ALL the carbs in your food every day ? if not I would advise you to do that,,, and if you decide to stay low or lower carb, I would specifically suggest you save 1/3 of your daily carb to your working time, where you use your brain and concentration very much... our brain uses around about 20 % of our energy and mostly blood glucose either from carb or the body itself transforms proteins into blood glucose in adequate amounts, well the brain is made by almost pure fat and proteins but it runs on blood glucose or in rare cases (like very low carb eating style) ketones... I would suggest you do count all grams of carbs so that you know for sure you don't eat more carbs than you think you do... and measure your morning numbers every morning so you know if you are in the normal range in general... You'll end up being happy to have total control and avoid getting all this adding horror stuff type 2 can lead to... but maybe your brain needs a little more carb while in your job, youll just need to avoid the carb more in your private time then... I think you can twist it all so it fits your special needs. I have also out of fear had a very hard time eating the very high-fat amounts that the low carb eating style leads to.. as I have har raised cholesterol many years... but to tell you a secret.

Ask more questions when you need to and someone will be able to help. BASIC INFORMATION FOR NEW MEMBERS Diabetes is the general term to describe people who have blood that is sweeter than normal. A number of different types of diabetes exist. A diagnosis of diabetes tends to be a big shock for most of us. Its far from the end of the world though and on this forum you'll find well over 210,000 people who are demonstrating this. On the forum we have found that with the number of new people being diagnosed with diabetes each day, sometimes the NHS is not being able to give all the advice it would perhaps like to deliver - particularly with regards to people with type 2 diabetes. The role of carbohydrate Carbohydrates are a factor in diabetes because they ultimately break down into sugar (glucose) within our blood. We then need enough insulin to either convert the blood sugar into energy for our body, or to store the blood sugar as body fat. If the amount of carbohydrate we take in is more than our bodys own (or injected) insulin can cope with, then our blood sugar will rise. The bad news Research indicates that raised blood sugar levels over a period of years can lead to organ damage, commonly referred to as diabetic complications . The good news People on the forum here have shown that there is plenty of opportunity to keep blood sugar levels from going too high. Its a daily task but its within our reach and its well worth the effort. Controlling your carbs The info below is primarily aimed at people with type 2 diabetes, however, it may also be of benefit for other types of diabetes as well. There are two approaches to controlling your carbs: Reduce your carbohydrate intake Choose better carbohydrates Reduce your carbohydrates A large number of people on this forum have chosen to reduce the amount of carbohydrates they eat as they have found this to be an effective way of improving (lowering) their blood sugar levels. The carbohydrates which tend to have the most pronounced effect on blood sugar levels tend to be starchy carbohydrates such as rice, pasta, bread, potatoes and similar root vegetables, flour based products (pastry, cakes, biscuits, battered food etc) and certain fruits. Choosing better carbohydrates The low glycaemic index diet is often favoured by healthcare professionals but some people with diabetes find that low GI does not help their blood sugar enough and may wish to cut out these foods altogether. Read more on carbohydrates and diabetes . Over 145,000 people have taken part in the Low Carb Program - a free 10 week structured education course that is helping people lose weight and reduce medication dependency by explaining the science behind carbs, insulin and GI. Eating what works for you Different people respond differently to different types of food. What works for one person may not work so well for another. The best way to see which foods are working for you is to test your blood sugar with a glucose meter. To be able to see what effect a particular type of food or meal has on your blood sugar is to do a test before the meal and then test after the meal. A test 2 hours after the meal gives a good idea of how your body has reacted to the meal. The blood sugar ranges recommended by NICE are as follows: Blood glucose ranges for type 2 diabetes Before meals: 4 to 7 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 8.5 mmol/l Blood glucose ranges for type 1 diabetes (adults) Before meals: 4 to 7 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 9 mmol/l Blood glucose ranges for type 1 diabetes (children) Before meals: 4 to 8 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 10 mmol/l However, those that are able to, may wish to keep blood sugar levels below the NICE after meal targets. Access to blood glucose test strips The NICE guidelines suggest that people newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes should be offered: structured education to every person and/or their carer at and around the time of diagnosis, with annual reinforcement and review self-monitoring of plasma glucose to a person newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes only as an integral part of his or her self-management education Therefore both structured education and self-monitoring of blood glucose should be offered to people with type 2 diabetes.

Today I had my bloods taken by my treatment room nurse for my appointment with the diabetes clinic next week. I normally wait till i see the consultant to hear my results but I've been working really hard on my numbers recently so very keen (and a bit excited) to find out my hbA1c result in particular. So I asked the nurse if I could ring in a couple of days for the results rather than wait the full week till I go to the clinic and she said no. She said the results go straight to the hospital and they don't have access to them. How could this be? I thought my GP would definitely have the results when they come from the lab. I'm in Northern Ireland. Has anyone else experience of this?,

You will only discover yours by using a meter. I could say anywhere between 150g carbs and 10g carbs daily. As for each meal, this again varies. Personally I can't have any at all for breakfast, a few at lunch, the majority at evening meal. I don't snack. Total up to 30g a day, often less. By testing our meals before and a couple of hours after first bite, keeping a food diary including portion sizes, and tweaking meals/foods/portion sizes until we are happy with the post meal levels is the only way to learn. It isn't a simple task, but worth it in the end.",

I found I didn't pack enough blood sugar testing gear, but then remembered I had packed a spare glucose meter and testing gear. I took too much insulin with me but it is better to err on the side of caution. I found as long as I kept hydrated and avoided dehydration I did not have higher blood sugar readings. There is a very good resource on what to do when ill on the Scottish diabetes uk site. I now have a Plan A and a Plan B for when I travel overseas but don't tend to be as organised when I'm at home. I make sure I have testing gear and sugar at hand if required. I like taking rehydration tablets cyclists use as a prevention. I want to fit in and still enjoy what I'm doing . Make sure you have some form of ID and or bracelet that identified diabetes using insulin. You only live once there 's no reason we should miss out on the fun things in life.

Been told by diabetes nurse to increase his lantus and give correction doses before each meal. She also suggested testing every 2 hours tomorrow if need be and give insulin if required. A little anxious on the whole matter. He never normally has high blood sugar readings. We did not expect him to be like this on holidays. Has anyone experienced this on before in a hotter climate? Am afraid of running out of test strips and insulin now and wondered if and how you can get some using EHIC card? Hoping someone can help. Click to expand...

Even with the same drop of blood you will be very lucky to get a similar reading, and that also applies to consecutive readings with the same meter. The general advice is to keep one hidden away to be used only in emergencies as a spare, and stick to one. Unless you are on insulin they don't have to be accurate to any extent. You are only looking for trends, and things will even out after several tests. I understand how annoying it can be - I get very cross about it sometimes, but it's all we have I'm afraid.",

Your point is my issue and it appears i experiance the same symptons as you. Today for example i woke with a level of 6, went to work for an hour+ and by the time i tested 'prior' to my injection/breakfast my levels were 9.5. if i had my usual 9/10 units Novorapid, 1 toast and small OJ my blood would potentially be as high as 15 an hour or so later!! My most recent experiment is to take the same dosage and only have 1 round of toast (no juice) and this gives me a more acceptable mid morning reading. As you experiance this only happens on a work day.....at weekends (no work) i would be battling to raise levels all morning if i had the same ratio of 9 units and 1 toast!? Likewise when i take 10 units at lunch i need 3 times the amount of carb intake....eg 2 bread, 1 apple and 1 yogurt!? As you note it may be the fact that stress of work etc is the sole reason and i not experiancing dawn phenonamem or liver dumps!!? Any guidance/advice appreciated.",

I was told a few years ago I was ""borderline"" diabetic type 2. Recently I wasnt feeling good, and knew it was to do with what I was eating, or overeating. I weigh 20 stone (female, aged 41). so i started to use one touch and was horrified to see my 1st reading was 21! This shocked me into a sensible diet healthy low carb and low cal. This was 2 weeks ago. I have lost about a stone in the two weeks, and my readings are now between 10 and 14 which is an improvement, but I know still not good. In the mornings now my reading is 10.5 after not eating for about 12 hours. from what I have read I understand that I probably have done some permanant damange to myself to have left this situation to get this bad without loosing weight or having a healthy diet ( I am a bad overeater), and I know my levels are still to high, but here is my question(s) should I run like the wind to the doctor to get medication right now, or is there any chance that if I loose about 5 stone plus and stick to a healthy low carb diet monitoring my blood sugar level, that eventually I could get myself in the 4-7 range without taking medication. I really dont want to, I already take two blood pressure pills and I just dont want to take more if it is POSSIBLE that I can avoid it. I know my levels are still high, but I thought as my body has shown some respone to the two weeks of healthy eating can things still improve? or am I just kidding myself. I feel sooooooooooooooooo much better since eating better and getting the levels down from 20 to 10. I would be so grateful if anyone would be kind enough to reply, I feel too sort of ashamed to discuss it with anyone.",

I think it is pretty low life tactics to present a thread as if it were about asking how T2s feel about themselves and then use it as a drive-by on the OP's take on T1s. It's not obvious to me that any T1s take that view of T2s on this forum. Frankly, if you want my take on it, I've not seen any threads here where a newly dx'd T2 has been advised by T1s, yet I've seen plenty of threads where a newly dx'd T1 has posted asking about how normal his/her life is now going to be , and some of the first responders have been T2s who've steamed in saying, ""go lchf, eat a big mac but don't eat the bun."" As a T1, it frankly does bother me that T2s, lovely though you all are, see fit to pitch in so early in a T1's dx to set out views which are more appropriate for T2s. The OP hasn't set out which threads which has led him to the view that T1s think themselves above T2s, so it is difficult to respond in any detail without speculating.",kmtech said: above Click to expand...

Sally, Your Total Cholesterol is 2.7 mmol/l TC=HDL+LDL+Trigs/2.19 Your numbers are very low, apart from the triglycerides which are slightly about NICE guidelines (less than 1.7mmol/l). The data is a bit sketchy, but there is some suggestion that low-cholesterol can cause problems. I wouldn't worry about it too much, I'm in the same boat, but I don't take statins. You should to talk to your Doctor about the statins: Firstly, you are exposing yourself to the potential risks of low-cholesterol and the side-effects of the statins, without gaining any benefit. Secondly, no-one has ever demonstrated a benefit in terms of mortality for women taking statins. It is my strong opinion that they should never be prescribed for females (except perhaps as a last resort). Kendrick said: To date, no large trial of women statin users who already have cardiovascular disease has been shown to increase life expectancy by one day. More importantly, the use of statins in women at lower risk has not increased life expectancy nor prevented heart attacks and stroke. It raises the question whether women should be prescribed statins at all. I believe that the answer is no. Statins fail to provide any overall health benefit in women. The more recent heart protection study was hailed as a success for men and women, but despite the hype there was no effect on mortality in women. Click to expand... Eddie Vos responding to Cochrane review said: What the editorial does not mention are differences with women, and where there is no doubt that there is no mortality benefit, as per at least three meta-analyses. Two of them found a relative risk [RR] of 1.00 versus placebo, including one including secondary prevention, and one concluding: ""Our study showed that statin therapy reduced the risk of CHD events in men without prior cardiovascular disease, but not in women. Statins did not reduce the risk of total mortality both in men and women"" Suggesting that women at any cardiac risk reduce all-cause deaths by taking statins is, at best, a statistics-derived artifact with unclear but massive numbers needed to treat, and at worst, a delusion or a deception. The reality: even in extreme-risk women in the much-cited 4S study,[5] there were three more deaths in women on statin than on placebo. I suggest that in a next analysis women and men should be treated separately, and this regarding all single individual endpoints. The universally abused reporting item of ""major cardiovascular events"" should be banished, since it virtually always includes non-fatal angina-related effects, including medical decisions such as non-life-saving planned revascularisations. For example, in JUPITER, revascularisations were by far the major ""event"" benefit and, in women, the only significant one after 6500 on-statin years and cardiovascular mortality was not reduced in either men or women.[6] When any-cause deaths are not reduced by drugs prescribed for a fatal disease, we are treating either lesser value effects, numbers in lab reports or other surrogate endpoints but not real causes.[7] That is the case for statins in women, a mathematical certainty.

It raises the question whether women should be prescribed statins at all. I believe that the answer is no. Statins fail to provide any overall health benefit in women. The more recent heart protection study was hailed as a success for men and women, but despite the hype there was no effect on mortality in women. Click to expand... Eddie Vos responding to Cochrane review said: What the editorial does not mention are differences with women, and where there is no doubt that there is no mortality benefit, as per at least three meta-analyses. Two of them found a relative risk [RR] of 1.00 versus placebo, including one including secondary prevention, and one concluding: ""Our study showed that statin therapy reduced the risk of CHD events in men without prior cardiovascular disease, but not in women. Statins did not reduce the risk of total mortality both in men and women"" Suggesting that women at any cardiac risk reduce all-cause deaths by taking statins is, at best, a statistics-derived artifact with unclear but massive numbers needed to treat, and at worst, a delusion or a deception. The reality: even in extreme-risk women in the much-cited 4S study,[5] there were three more deaths in women on statin than on placebo. I suggest that in a next analysis women and men should be treated separately, and this regarding all single individual endpoints. The universally abused reporting item of ""major cardiovascular events"" should be banished, since it virtually always includes non-fatal angina-related effects, including medical decisions such as non-life-saving planned revascularisations. For example, in JUPITER, revascularisations were by far the major ""event"" benefit and, in women, the only significant one after 6500 on-statin years and cardiovascular mortality was not reduced in either men or women.[6] When any-cause deaths are not reduced by drugs prescribed for a fatal disease, we are treating either lesser value effects, numbers in lab reports or other surrogate endpoints but not real causes.[7] That is the case for statins in women, a mathematical certainty.

Say you eat 15g carbs and take 1 unit (this gives an insulin-to-carb ratio of 1:15) If your blood sugar are still too high your insulin-to-carb ratio should probably be lower, and you need more insulin. If it has to be lower you can try 10g carbs per unit, insulin-to-carb ratio: 1:1. Insulin-to-carb ratio can also be as low as 1:0.5, maybe even lower. While for others it can be way higher.

I think the advice above to phone GP diabetes nurse (I would never be patronising) is excellent advice; I suspect that if you are eating and drinking OK, not sleepy, confused or light headed, they will probably just do the tests next week as planned, but I would hope that they would measure not only the diabetes diagnosis tests (glucose level and HbA1c), but also cholesterol, and renal function; yu have already had a normal blood count.. Testing your glucose level several mornings before breakfast and writing the numbers down would help to give them more information.

Sent from the Diabetes Forum App","Spiker said: No, because blood circulation is not optional. Carb consumption is optional. Intolerance is variable, not absolute. Intolerance of carbs in diabetics is proportional to their insulin resistance and inversely proportional to their ability to produce insulin. Since even advanced stage Type 1s have tiny insulin production, they have a tiny amount of remaining tolerance to carbs. The way see it is like this. Giving a diabetic carbs and insulin is like giving someone poison, and then giving them a second, poisonous antidote for the first poison. If the antidote is exactly matched to the poison, all the time, no harm is done. If the match is anything less than perfect (and it never will be perfect) then either the first poison (glucose) predominates and causes damage, or the second poison (insulin) predominates and does damage.

Don't panic as it's nice to have a long appointment with a nurse or GP ref diabetes. I suspect the nurse will explain the implications of your HBa1c result which is far more important than the fasting test. Depending on the result she may prescribe Metformin or do this in the future; it's a very safe drug which most of us take and it helps a bit with blood sugar. She will probably test your feet via the toes for nerve loss with a 'feather' and tuning fork. She may check your cardio performance and discuss diet and so on. The most important thing at this 'pre-diabetes' stage is your diet. The NHS can sometimes recommend a quite bizarre approach to diet depending on the GP or nurse. Keep an open mind and also look at diet advice on this website and ask any questions after the appointment. Basically you need a 'balanced' diet 'balanced' for diabetics and that means keeping portion sizes down a bit and reducing the carbs more than anything else. In summary you should find the appointment very easy and a chance to find out more depending on how good the DN is. I suspect you may also have had a urine test done so it's a chance to discuss your kidney state, cholesterol level and so on. BTW you may be offered statins. The arguments continue on these so it's your choice if offered. Good luck.",

Some people here espouse that one, as a diabetic, should eat zero carbs...that is DANGEROUS information and this site should admonish those who state that as a fact (Trump style alternate fact I guess). As a diabetic your goal is to maintain good glucose control. That means setting a goal and working with your care team to achieve that goal. Whether you're newly diagnosed or and old hand those goals are always to have good glucose control. Achieving good control is the best way to avoid complications !! Eating fewer carbs than you did before you were diagnosed will likely help...but for many T2's who tend to be overweight to begin with eating less of everything will help. Going low carb in the beginning of treatment might help reduce your BG (many call this a detox of sorts)...staying ultra low carb is typically unsustainable...ask all those who started Atkins and find out who's maintained that way of eating for more than 6 months.

There are ""targets"" set to evidence good blood glucose control - before a meal and two hours after starting to eat. The key is post-meal which they say should be at 8.5 or lower on the 2 hours. If you're taking 60-80g Carbs per day, you're doing a cracking job and should get a good result. Personally, I take a stiff walk about 30 minutes after I finish eating to warm the muscles up a bit and absorb the glucose that I've just taken in. This, along with much looser carb control than you're managing but strong calorie control, has pulled my HbA1c down to 43 (yay).

In the case of insulinomas what food you eat doesn't affect the insulin output much. The nature of insulinomas is to constantly secrete insulin. This is is what they do. The clue is in the name. In order to balance the insulin produced eating carbs is a good idea or your BG can fall dangerously low. This is not a reactive response to carbs. I do understand how difficult things have been for you and that low carbing works like a miracle for you and that is excellent.

This will help you understand when to test. There may be many reasons you want a baseline at the same time of day to indicate whether your control is improving you want to know the impact of a certain type of food you want to know the impact of exercise you want to know if you can exercise (I struggle if my BG is too high or too low) in the UK, if your diabetes is treated by drugs which lower your BG (e.g. insulin) we must, by law, test before driving to ensure our BG is not too low if you are able to temporarily correct your BG (e.g. I can reduce my BG with insulin and increase it with glucose), you may want to test before sleeping ... The testing around ""meals"" is, as been discussed above, so you can understand what impact certain foods have on your BG. Before you ""ditch the fruit juice"", you may want to give it a go - test before, drink, test 2 hours later. The rise may be enough to put you off any future juicing temptations ... or you may be incredibly lucky and not rise by much. Over time, you may start to learn what foods do what and could reduce your testing. Our bodies change so it definitely not a good idea to stop completely. But you may start becoming interested in something like exercise to reduce your BG. I guess what I am saying is not to test just because a doctor or a piece of paper tells you to: testing does not reduce your BG. Learning how your body works by looking at the BG is what reduces your BG ... and helps you manage/reverse your pre-diabetes.",

What we normally do for newly diagnosed and new members is get @daisy1 to come along with a long list of very helpful information of how you can get your diabetes under control. It will all seem a little daunting at first but things will start to fit in to place. I think, but I am no expert that the Fatty Liver will be contributing to you being very insulin resistant which will be preventing you processing the glucose in your blood,, you will probably be diagnosed with type 2 but until you had had the fasting test etc. it's very hard to tell. Your GP will confirm your diagnosis and I would presume give you some medication but it will be the diet control that will be the main help for you. Continue to look around the forum, and ask as many question as you want there are lots of people here with a good deal of information. Neil",

Over that time I have attended parties for birthdays, weddings, Christmas, christenings and a couple of funeral wakes (not related to diabetes). Having diabetes should not stop anyone attending parties and enjoying themselves ... and that includes drinking alcohol. I was diagnosed in my 30s and made very little change to my lifestyle. The biggest change I made was to buy a handbag because I couldn't fit my diabetes paraphernalia in my pocket. I suspect men's pocket sizes are more suited to carrying ""stuff"". But apart from the bag, my life carried on in the same way with the same amount of exercise, travel, work, food, fun, heartache, ... Sure, it takes a bit more planning and that handbag is very full when travelling but I have not come across anything I cannot do because I have diabetes. At 26, your son sounds pretty independent. Diabetes should not take that away from him. It's great that you want to learn as much as possible about his condition and understandable that, as a mother, you worry about him. But the only person who can manage their diabetes is the person with diabetes. Not parents, not partners, not doctors. They provide guidance when you visit ... they do not deal with the day to day management.

Have you tested that? For me, eggs and bacon would give a gentle sloping rise then fall (maybe 1mmol/l in all) which would last 2-3 hours. Then my bg would drift nicely downwards and then coast til my next meal. But I only know this through steady testing every half hour or so, all day.) And - this is key - what are your bg levels before you eat either breakfast? Do you test your fasting blood glucose, and your pre-breakfast blood glucose? Have you heard of Dawn Phenomenon? AKA morning glucose dumps? Your raised bg after the protein breakfast could be more to do with Dawn Phenomenon than what you ate for brekkie. As @bluetit says, it is the rise from the food that is most important. So you need to measure before eating, and then 2 hrs later, consistently, to be able to compare different meals. And in order to compare them properly, you would need to have the same amount of exercise after each meal, otherwise you are introducing some pretty wild card variables (time, exercise AND carbs). Sorry if I am making it sound complicated. It isn't.

Going from numb to painful means that your good diet has started to reverse and heal this diabetic complication. Eventually the pain should go away altogether. Sorry about the stress and bereavement, but you seem to be approaching this difficult time with great good sense. Here is a quotation from Dr Bernstein's ""Diabetes Solution"": ""DIABETIC NEUROPATHIES Diabetic neuropathies seem to improve in two phasesa rapid partial improvement that may occur within weeks, followed by sustained very slow improvement that goes on for years if blood sugars continue to remain normal. This is most apparent with numbness or pain in the toes. Some people will even comment, I know right away if my blood sugar is high, because my toes feel numb again. On the other hand, several patients with total numbness of their feet have complained of severe pain after several months of near-normal blood sugars. This continues for a number of months and eventually resolves as sensation returns. It is as if nerves generate pain signals while they heal or sprout. The experience may be very frightening and distressing if you havent been warned that it might occur.""

The protein itself will also act on your blood sugars and in a much less predictable way than the carbs because it takes so much longer to process. Why not get yourself a food program - I use cronometer and try recording everything that you eat for a bit.

And before you start on mental issues, they are statistically as prevalent in cannabis users as in the general population. Cannabis may be a trigger but not the cause.

We've been worried about her health for a while now as she is over weight, constantly tired and suffers from Polymyalgia. She has been on Prednisalone for about 18 months which has slowly reduced in levels. The steroids have helped with her condition but for a long while she has been suffering from terrible dry mouth that drives her to distraction, extreme tiredness and general lethargy. A few months ago my wife told me the doctors had said she was now borderline diabetic which started me worrying immediately. I don't have diabetes but I do test myself regularly as I'm a road race cyclist and love learning and experimenting with my diet and training and watching how my body reacts and most importantly I read constantly so when told of this borderline diabetes I was concerned that my wife and mother in law didn't seem too bothered!! Anyway, last week she was very sadly diagnosed as type 2 diabetic and has been given Metaformin. I have come accross research showing the links to steroids and diabetes so it's not wholly surprising that it has developed. I've never before tested her for high blood sugar levels before so decided to yesterday and was shocked to see it at 28.1. I didn't think at the time but I should have tested her blood ketones too I think? My real concern is that as this is seriously high it is doing her some real damage. I'm going to test her again later today and see if its any lower. She isn't due to see the doctor for a while yet but is seeing the diabetic nutritionist next week. Surely though with levels as high as 28.1 diet isn't going to help and she may need insulin to bring it down? My wife and I are really anxious about it so if anyone has advice as to what to do next?

Wine is actually low carbohydrate - very, which is a positive thing for a recreational drink if worried about blood sugar levels. And, weirdly, alcohol can stop the liver dumping lots of glucose into the blood very early in the morning, which is a common problem for diabetics (it's due to a 'misreading' of the sugar in the blood signals) - as the liver is 'too busy' dealing with the alcohol! Those are the key features about wine in relation to diabetes. Alcohol drinking and health generally - now that's another issue! Which is what Shar and Nosher are talking to you about. If I was you, and worried about getting diabetes, due to having both parents diabetic (I am assuming T2?), I would be where you are - in this forum! Reading stuff that seems to apply. Good one! . And see yourself as someone with a very high chance of having inherited a high-carbohydrate intolerance, and lower the amount of carbs you may be eating, and drinking if you like sugary sodas/drinks. And make sure you are getting enough vitamin D3, magnesium and chrome in your diet. And see belly fat as a very real warning signal. ie if you have belly fat, or gaining it - take it seriously. (I just read 'Flat Belly Diet Diabetes' which I thought rather good.) (I say this, as I had big belly issues for the longest time, knew it was correlated with bad health - and felt really powerless about what to do about it. I had no idea about the role of carbs in that. And I would've liked the Flat Belly book at the time. So just in case the big belly thing applies to you.) Yeah - and get your blood tested every six months. (I personally am a test-case in point of someone who did NOT get enough blood tests done in what was obviously a key danger period! Pre-diabetes and diabetes proper can actually come on very fast in some circumstances.) And if I was you and worried about alcohol generally - yeah - go the 'going two or three days in a row without alcohol a week' number. That gives your liver time to clear out the alcohol in your bloodstream, it keeps a handle on any addiction issues that you might have, or might be developing (if you go three days without alcohol it is bound to put the role of alcohol in your life into focus! And then if you think that needs work - you can act on that.) I've had some seriously alcoholic friends who have done what the Swedes call 'white days' - ie have days in a row of no-alcohol, that has helped them keep a lid on their addiction. Just a lid mind - I have only seen the full AA number in American movies - where they give up alcohol entirely. But the lid can work wonders none the less - and makes sense if you are thinking about cutting down the number of bottles of wine consumed every week.","annette_williams said: My mum just been diagnosed and my dad had it before he died..I thought i would get tested because you never know and the chemist said it was high.I like a drink of wine and i was worried that has caused the high level,My dad died with alcohol related problems,my x husband died because of alcohol too at 43 and i am a bit paranoid.i have about 3/4 bottles of wine a week.??????????????

Ask as many questions as you want and someone will be able to help. BASIC INFORMATION FOR NEWLY DIAGNOSED DIABETICS Diabetes is the general term to describe people who have blood that is sweeter than normal. A number of different types of diabetes exist. A diagnosis of diabetes tends to be a big shock for most of us. Its far from the end of the world though and on this forum you'll find well over 235,000 people who are demonstrating this. On the forum we have found that with the number of new people being diagnosed with diabetes each day, sometimes the NHS is not being able to give all the advice it would perhaps like to deliver - particularly with regards to people with type 2 diabetes. The role of carbohydrate Carbohydrates are a factor in diabetes because they ultimately break down into sugar (glucose) within our blood. We then need enough insulin to either convert the blood sugar into energy for our body, or to store the blood sugar as body fat. If the amount of carbohydrate we take in is more than our bodys own (or injected) insulin can cope with, then our blood sugar will rise. The bad news Research indicates that raised blood sugar levels over a period of years can lead to organ damage, commonly referred to as diabetic complications . The good news People on the forum here have shown that there is plenty of opportunity to keep blood sugar levels from going too high. Its a daily task but its within our reach and its well worth the effort. Controlling your carbs The info below is primarily aimed at people with type 2 diabetes, however, it may also be of benefit for other types of diabetes as well. There are two approaches to controlling your carbs: Reduce your carbohydrate intake Choose better carbohydrates Reduce your carbohydrates A large number of people on this forum have chosen to reduce the amount of carbohydrates they eat as they have found this to be an effective way of improving (lowering) their blood sugar levels. The carbohydrates which tend to have the most pronounced effect on blood sugar levels tend to be starchy carbohydrates such as rice, pasta, bread, potatoes and similar root vegetables, flour based products (pastry, cakes, biscuits, battered food etc) and certain fruits. Choosing better carbohydrates The low glycaemic index diet is often favoured by healthcare professionals but some people with diabetes find that low GI does not help their blood sugar enough and may wish to cut out these foods altogether. Read more on carbohydrates and diabetes . Over 145,000 people have taken part in the Low Carb Program - a 10 week structured education course that is helping people lose weight and reduce medication dependency by explaining the science behind carbs, insulin and GI. Eating what works for you Different people respond differently to different types of food. What works for one person may not work so well for another. The best way to see which foods are working for you is to test your blood sugar with a glucose meter. To be able to see what effect a particular type of food or meal has on your blood sugar is to do a test before the meal and then test after the meal. A test 2 hours after the meal gives a good idea of how your body has reacted to the meal. The blood sugar ranges recommended by NICE are as follows: Blood glucose ranges for type 2 diabetes Before meals: 4 to 7 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 8.5 mmol/l Blood glucose ranges for type 1 diabetes (adults) Before meals: 4 to 7 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 9 mmol/l Blood glucose ranges for type 1 diabetes (children) Before meals: 4 to 8 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 10 mmol/l However, those that are able to, may wish to keep blood sugar levels below the NICE after meal targets. Access to blood glucose test strips The NICE guidelines suggest that people newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes should be offered: structured education to every person and/or their carer at and around the time of diagnosis, with annual reinforcement and review self-monitoring of plasma glucose to a person newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes only as an integral part of his or her self-management education Therefore both structured education and self-monitoring of blood glucose should be offered to people with type 2 diabetes.

If you developed Type 2 due to some genetic reason, or if, as I suspect is the case with many people diagnosed late in life, their pancreas is ""wearing out"", then you are just in the controlled state rather than in remission, like someone with a peanut allergy who avoids peanuts.","Cocosilk said: If it takes the best part of someone's life to end up diabetic, once you reverse it by eating the right things, do those who go back to eating the wrong things end up diabetic much faster the next time around? Or only as fast as it took you to reverse it, perhaps? If you eat the wrong things for 40 years, then in a few months bring your levels back to pretty good with a low carb diet, it makes sense that if you started eating the wrong things again, it might only be a matter of months before you end up in trouble again, right? But if you eat the right things for the next 20 years, you might get away with eating more carbohydrates again, depending on which ones and how much of them. Has anyone proven this theory? I mean, are there any documented cases of some older folk who were eating carbs again after years of healing their bodies on low carb diets, for example? Click to expand..."

Obviously, that doesn't address the underlying issue, but it'll at least mean that while you figure out ways of sorting it out, you'll at least have the security blanket of getting woken up by the phone ringing if you drop too low instead of getting repeated hypos night after night, which must be sooo tiring. You can set the hypo alarm to any level you want, so, say you set it to 6 or 7, it'll catch you on the sharp drop down from the teens, and give you time to figure out how much carb you need to tail it off so it stops about 5.5 instead of going into hypo-land and not rebounding too much. It'll maybe give you a bit of respite while you get the larger issues sorted out.",

Yeah, been there, done that, done the shopping, cooked and then said to myself, is that it! I've never ate like this? My family, my doctor, my friends, what will they say? What will I eat? Ok, meat! Protein as in eggs, Lots and lots of vegetables, I have never ate spinach, but now it's in every salad I have! Low carb homemade soups, curry, stews, make a lot and freeze, which we save you money! Dairy, full fat, cheeses, yoghurt cream. Small pieces of fruit, preferably berries, Apple, pears. There is so much to eat! I just had bacon and egg and tomatoes. Dinner is a piece of gammon from a joint. With a bit of salad. Chicken for my evening meal again from a roasted bird. And supper, is yoghurt, a few strawberries and a couple pieces of 85% dark chocolate to let in the New Year! Travelling tomorrow and meat from roasts will keep me going till I get back. Doing a small joint of roast pork for my New Year's dinner, with Apple sauce and veg! Sorted, all low carb and keeps me healthy! This is not going to happen overnight, your own personal choices, come heavily into your thinking, you do need to discover how to get control, so you can feel better, that will take a bit of time, but it's well worth it, the feeling of energy and losing weight is brilliant. It is now nearly three and a half years since my diagnosis. I've gone through what you are going through. It's not nice, the dread and fear doesn't stop straight away. The so called experts are few and far, I was lucky to find my endocrinologist, we are rare and unique in all our own way! Please, you need to keep fighting for a diagnosis, it took me years to get mine. It is worth it! The consequences are not worth thinking about! Learn about the condition and how we treat it. It is mainly dietary. The things you eat and believe are healthy for you are not! The basic foodstuff that we are supposed to depend on, is like a poison to us! I am weird, my GP and my endocrinologist agreed with him, but us weirdos have got to grips with this condition, I've lost five stone plus, I am fitter and healthier than I have been for decades. I work very hard, I have great energy, I don't have the symptoms no more, it is always there, there is no cure, there is however a way to control it and live a normal (ish) life. I'm 61, in full time employment, coach football at kids level, look after my disabled wife and I do all the chores, shopping, and I wouldn't change anything! If I didn't have the control, everything, would go to the dogs! Try and be positive and take it easy, this is for the rest of your life, your future health!

Could be that she's in something calked the honeymoon period where her pancreas will start producing insulin for a short time before finally giving up.

I recommend having a doctors note on hand just in case. I have been travelling regularly (with transfers) with diabetes for nearly 15 years and only had to show mine once. I cannot remember/spot how you treat your diabetes - is it with a pen or a pump. Whichever it is, make sure you have backups of everything. If it is a pump, don't let it be x-rayed. You are unlikely to see your suitcase until you get to your final destination (a few countries, like USA are awkward with transfers but Denmark is fine). You may have to be security searched (through the x-rays) at Copenhagen. Different airports vary so I am not sure.

Ok, first question: what is the significance of the 1.5/2hr post prandial reading? It seems a bit arbitrary, especially given that blood sugar peaks after just one hour following a meal. Is it because BG levels are sustained for longer at these times? I was also wondering whether there was anything inherently wrong with having a glass of wine or vodka with an/every evening meal, given that it reduces the size of a spike, and seems to set me up at a decent level for the evening? It seems like cheating somehow, so I figured there must be a catch. I'm not talking about a balls-out ****-up, just a drink or two.",

The following is pure speculation, and your tests will see if my guess is accurate: Sometimes when we have particular 'glucose issues' (and there is a much wider range of 'glucose issues' than just standard diabetes, whether T1, 2, 3 or 1.5) our blood glucose can rise VERY quickly after eating, and then DROP very quickly after eating. This can result in physical reactions like hypos, hunger, mood swings, etc. In this case, it isn't actually the blood glucose level that causes the symptoms, it is the SPEED of the rise and fall. Another possibility (and this happens to me), is that the symptoms you are experiencing are the fight-or-flight adrenalin/stress reaction that your own body produces when your blood glucose drops too low. So that you aren't necessarily feeling the symptoms until AFTER your body has identified that your glucose is dropping, and has released the hormones that with trigger your liver to release glucose into your bloodstream. - and it is those hormones you are feeling, not the hypo itself. If this latter suggestion is what is happening, then by the time you feel your symptoms and get your test kit out, your body has already taken care of the low blood glucose and would explain why your blood glucose is normal. I second the suggestion to do a forum search on 'reactive hypoglycaemia'. Even if it doesn't resonate with you, I think you will find it an interesting read. As mentioned above, a bit of systematic testing should prove (or disprove) my suggestions. If you disprove them, then maybe looking at food intolerances, eating patterns (does it always happen after certain foods, or certain ingredients) might be things to look at. Hope that helps. Edited to add: We have had a lot of posters, T2 and Reactive Hypoglycaemics, who have found that their fatigue and low energy improve dramatically with (very) low carbing. I have no idea what you are currently eating, but that may be worth considering too...",

The glicazide should help either way, but it's an incomplete and short term way of addressing the issue and I would be extremely surprised if it helped you even come close to normal glucose levels. You need to continue to push for a definitive diagnosis and the next steps are to request the C-Peptide (or an insulin test if you're not yet on artificial insulin) and GAD Antibody tests. Those will help you understand if you have type 1 or 2. This is not something that can wait and it can have permanent (if not life-threatening) implications if left untreated for too long. I don't want to scare you, but having gone through something very similar 4 months ago, I now understand the importance and time-sensitivity. Click to expand..."

Apparently its your evolutionary flight response. In stressful situations your brain instructs your liver to dump to glucose so that you have energy if you need to run away. You then need to generate an insulin response to mop it up which of course as Type 2's is the problem.

So decided to contact my GP and ask could I book in for a blood test to rule out Diabetes. The GP agreed and I went and had the blood test at 10.00am and at 18.00 hrs she was ringing me at home to say my bm was 27! Yes I had type 2 Diabetes. I was immediately booked in to see the Diabetic Nurse within 48 hrs and was given Metformin tabs and some diet sheets, and the chance to ask any questions. It was a shock ,but I kind of prepared myself for the bad news. I am quite good at knowing what the right thing is to eat, in the past I have just overindulged and eaten too much, been overweight for too many years. However since Xmas I had been eating healthily and had lost 2 stone, but the increased thirst and going to wee every hour was not right for me! I lost 7lbs the week before I was diagnosed. I can understand its a scary time for you, but the sooner you see a GP and get the blood test done then help will be at hand. There is so much info available and the Diabetes .co.uk ( this website ) has the answers to most of it. The Walk-in Centre should have been able to at least check your bm ( blood sugars) with a finger prick test and if you were above 12 they can often refer you to your GP and ask that you see someone same day. I would try and see any GP at your surgery next week asap and try not to worry too much. It is a lifestyle change but everyone reacts differently and you can do things at a pace that is right for you. I hope you get the blood test soon and if it is positive there is help to make you feel better. Soon as I started taking the tablets I feel 100% better, more energy, not feeling thirsty, nothaving to get up 6 times a night for a wee! Sleeping better and I have an answer to why I had been feeling so awful. Good luck and let us know how you do.",

Hi @Debandez I am in the same boat as you, with somewhat raised ferritin levels for a pre-menopausal woman. Your doc should contact you and suggest further tests. If they don't, then chase it. My doc ordered a raft of blood tests, all came back 'normal' except for one where the sample had been unsuitable. No further action required, said doc. Not even a retest for the corrupted ferritin sample. Which was a bit frustrating. So I am going to monitor things myself. There is a history of high ferritin in the family, but no genetic connection has yet been found (my father had tests), but that is hardly conclusive when you consider how many genes have not yet been mapped. Women who have a tendency towards high ferritin (it is often genetic) can see the numbers trend upwards after menopause, when they were OK before that - so it definitely needs watching. I am 52, so I am in the 'watch with care' age band. If you do a bit of reading, you can find some fascinating facts, including stuff like Vit C intake is fundamentally linked to iron intake. This means that by eating Vit C foods alongside or NOT alongside iron containing foods, you can increase or decrease your absorption of iron, which then affects your ferritin levels. As @Winnie53 says, donating blood is a fab way to lower ferritin levels, and in fact it is the usual treatment for high ferritin. However, it is far better to find out WHY they are raised, than just book in for a blood donation without understanding the cause for the high levels.",

The message on the newly diagnosed sub-forum is clear.. and that message is the one that is recommended by NICE. However... the point of a forum is discussion and shared experience... and in other sub-forums is see no reason why discussion on the 'recommended' level shouldn't take place.. After all an awful lot of us who have been diagnosed for sometime would have palpitations if our readings ran at levels as recommended by NICE.. Will different messages be confusing.. yes probably is that a problem... I don't think so.. We are no better than the NHS if we don't share our knowledge and experiences.. if we just say these are the 'rules' live with them... people offer opinions.. a lot of the time they also provide links to lots of interesting studies and other information sources.. we are all adults and should all be able to go and read and make our OWN INFORMED DECISION ... At the end of the day what levels you run at and how you achieve those levels is your own business... but I would like to think that atleast when people make that choice they have as much information as possible... Reference the 'arguments' / 'discussions' yes sometimes perhaps they do split over.. but also a lot of topics and threads on this forum are full of helpful information.. and a lot of this comes from these discussions... we don't agree with everyone else in real life.. I don't see why we should all agree here.. as long as people aren't rude or abusive or blatantly trolling I don't see the problem.

May be it will take longer time to achieve as It took 10 years of overeating to become insulin resistant.","Mbaker said: For a low calorie diet to work for the long term it is important to understand that in successful trials the participants need to eat 33% less than the previous set point, and do some exercise (Professor Roy Taylor). It is likely that your resting metabolic rate will go down as well. I think working towards health by any means is better than nothing, but low calorie does enable what some would class as ""normal"" food i.e. what most people eat. Low Carb / Keto has some issues, such as social acceptability, continual criticism (unfounded in my opinion), it does increase LDL in around 30% of participants - which is only a problem if you believe the diet heart hypothesis (shaky science), or LDL is high, HDL is low and Triglycerides are low - in this state further investigation is warranted. HDL and Trigs tend to improve on Low Carb / Keto. From what I have seen LCHF / Keto reversals / remission appear to have lower HbA1c's than low calorie persons achieve, which seem to be more in the pre-diabetic range from what I have observed.

And if you take it less than 22 hours apart you are likely to get a small period of overlapping Lantus. I see two options - take it whilst you are out. You don't have to take it at exactly the same time as you usually do. Aim to take it between 7:30pm and 10:30pm. - take it when you get home. If you do this, you could gradually move it back to your usual time over the next few days (e.g. if you get home at 11pm and take it then, tomorrow take it at 10pm and then on Sunday, revert back to your usual time). Remember to take a BG reading when you get home, eat something small before you go to bed like a biscuit (if you are socialising, you may go low overnight) and don't let diabetes get in the way of having a great time.",

As an exercise, to see just how good their so called 'Diabetic Testing' was, a non-diabetic friend and myself went to 'Asda' some years ago for a free 'Diabetic Test' and both of us was subsequently told that neither of us had diabetes (In fact I'm a registered Type 2) and the nurse who conducted the finger prick testing (if that's what you call her) was quite taken back and seriously offended when after being tested, I then informed her that I was in fact a Type 2 diabetic and that Asda's random Diabetic testing was in the main a complete waste of time - Since then my local Asda has decided to no longer conduct these random Diabetic Tests on the general public - Enough said I think. There is no substitute for your friend other than persuading him/her to visit the GP/Hospital and get a proper HbA1c test done.",

Using a moisturizing lotion, or even olive oil on them would be a good idea. Please do not try to cut away, or shave or abrade it off - it seems that a lot of serious complications arise from quite small injuries, which then become infected. It might be nothing more serious than badly fitting shoes, but warm baths, even just a footbath, walking, going up and down a flight of stairs three times (to use the muscles in your legs to help pump the blood around) all might help.

Some helpful posts above too. Carry on asking questions as there is always someone who can help as you have seen. BASIC INFORMATION FOR NEWLY DIAGNOSED DIABETICS Diabetes is the general term to describe people who have blood that is sweeter than normal. A number of different types of diabetes exist. A diagnosis of diabetes tends to be a big shock for most of us. Its far from the end of the world though and on this forum youll find over 130,000 people who are demonstrating this. On the forum we have found that with the number of new people being diagnosed with diabetes each day, sometimes the NHS is not being able to give all the advice it would perhaps like to deliver - particularly with regards to people with type 2 diabetes. The role of carbohydrate Carbohydrates are a factor in diabetes because they ultimately break down into sugar (glucose) within our blood. We then need enough insulin to either convert the blood sugar into energy for our body, or to store the blood sugar as body fat. If the amount of carbohydrate we take in is more than our bodys own (or injected) insulin can cope with, then our blood sugar will rise. The bad news Research indicates that raised blood sugar levels over a period of years can lead to organ damage, commonly referred to as diabetic complications . The good news People on the forum here have shown that there is plenty of opportunity to keep blood sugar levels from going too high. Its a daily task but its within our reach and its well worth the effort. Controlling your carbs The info below is primarily aimed at people with type 2 diabetes, however, it may also be of benefit for other types of diabetes as well. There are two approaches to controlling your carbs: Reduce your carbohydrate intake Choose better carbohydrates Reduce your carbohydrates A large number of people on this forum have chosen to reduce the amount of carbohydrates they eat as they have found this to be an effective way of improving (lowering) their blood sugar levels. The carbohydrates which tend to have the most pronounced effect on blood sugar levels tend to be starchy carbohydrates such as rice, pasta, bread, potatoes and similar root vegetables, flour based products (pastry, cakes, biscuits, battered food etc) and certain fruits. Choosing better carbohydrates Another option is to replace white carbohydrates (such as white bread, white rice, white flour etc) with whole grain varieties. The idea behind having whole grain varieties is that the carbohydrates get broken down slower than the white varieties and these are said to have a lower glycaemic index. http://www.diabetes.co.uk/food/diabetes-and-whole-grains.html The low glycaemic index diet is often favoured by healthcare professionals but some people with diabetes find that low GI does not help their blood sugar enough and may wish to cut out these foods altogether. Read more on carbohydrates and diabetes Eating what works for you Different people respond differently to different types of food. What works for one person may not work so well for another. The best way to see which foods are working for you is to test your blood sugar with a glucose meter. To be able to see what effect a particular type of food or meal has on your blood sugar is to do a test before the meal and then test after the meal. A test 2 hours after the meal gives a good idea of how your body has reacted to the meal. The blood sugar ranges recommended by NICE are as follows: Blood glucose ranges for type 2 diabetes Before meals: 4 to 7 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 8.5 mmol/l Blood glucose ranges for type 1 diabetes (adults) Before meals: 4 to 7 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 9 mmol/l Blood glucose ranges for type 1 diabetes (children) Before meals: 4 to 8 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 10 mmol/l However, those that are able to, may wish to keep blood sugar levels below the NICE after meal targets. Access to blood glucose test strips The NICE guidelines suggest that people newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes should be offered: structured education to every person and/or their carer at and around the time of diagnosis, with annual reinforcement and review self-monitoring of plasma glucose to a person newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes only as an integral part of his or her self-management education Therefore both structured education and self-monitoring of blood glucose should be offered to people with type 2 diabetes.

Over eight years ago I was prescribed Quinine Sulphate and, until a few months ago, never had even one twinge of cramp of any kind. However, that 'honeymoon' was ended when my specialist said that such prolonged use had irrevocably damaged my kidneys and that I am now CKD at Stage 3 and very likely to progress to Stage 4/5. I had always thought until now that when the cramps returned, which they have with a vengeance, I could always look to Magnesium Citrate, Sulphate or Chloride to help me. BUT have just been told that the kidneys cannot excrete Magnesium when at Stage 4 or 5. Last two nights have been almost as bad as when first 'attacked' all those years ago (which were obviously a precursor or sign that I was an undiagnosed Diabetic then) so, I reluctantly took a Lyrica capsule which calmed matters down over the next two hours. Lyrica is not a preventative, with many side effects, but a palliative - QS and Mag are proactive. The most severe leg cramps not only hurt like hell for perhaps two or more hours but damage muscles and tendons in the affected leg(s) for perhaps two days and affecting walking afterwards. My Question is - does anyone know an alternative to QS, Mag or Lyrica that can help me because going to bed is becoming a nightmare ha ha ha? This condition can sometimes come on while I am riding my motorcycle and I have to stand up on the pedals or stick my leg out at right angles - imagine the thoughts of those driving behind me lol? Please do not suggested Sodium Chloride because have tried that and it did not help one iota. Thankyou for your patience, Rob",

BASIC INFORMATION FOR NEW MEMBERS Diabetes is the general term to describe people who have blood that is sweeter than normal. A number of different types of diabetes exist. A diagnosis of diabetes tends to be a big shock for most of us. Its far from the end of the world though and on this forum you'll find well over 300,000 people who are demonstrating this. On the forum we have found that with the number of new people being diagnosed with diabetes each day, sometimes the NHS is not being able to give all the advice it would perhaps like to deliver - particularly with regards to people with type 2 diabetes. The role of carbohydrate Carbohydrates are a factor in diabetes because they ultimately break down into sugar (glucose) within our blood. We then need enough insulin to either convert the blood sugar into energy for our body, or to store the blood sugar as body fat. If the amount of carbohydrate we take in is more than our bodys own (or injected) insulin can cope with, then our blood sugar will rise. The bad news Research indicates that raised blood sugar levels over a period of years can lead to organ damage, commonly referred to as diabetic complications . The good news People on the forum here have shown that there is plenty of opportunity to keep blood sugar levels from going too high. Its a daily task but its within our reach and its well worth the effort. Controlling your carbs The info below is primarily aimed at people with type 2 diabetes, however, it may also be of benefit for other types of diabetes as well. There are two approaches to controlling your carbs: Reduce your carbohydrate intake Choose better carbohydrates Reduce your carbohydrates A large number of people on this forum have chosen to reduce the amount of carbohydrates they eat as they have found this to be an effective way of improving (lowering) their blood sugar levels. The carbohydrates which tend to have the most pronounced effect on blood sugar levels tend to be starchy carbohydrates such as rice, pasta, bread, potatoes and similar root vegetables, flour based products (pastry, cakes, biscuits, battered food etc) and certain fruits. Choosing better carbohydrates The low glycaemic index diet is often favoured by healthcare professionals but some people with diabetes find that low GI does not help their blood sugar enough and may wish to cut out these foods altogether. Read more on carbohydrates and diabetes . Over 145,000 people have taken part in the Low Carb Program - a 10 week structured education course that is helping people lose weight and reduce medication dependency by explaining the science behind carbs, insulin and GI. Eating what works for you Different people respond differently to different types of food. What works for one person may not work so well for another. The best way to see which foods are working for you is to test your blood sugar with a glucose meter. To be able to see what effect a particular type of food or meal has on your blood sugar is to do a test before the meal and then test after the meal. A test 2 hours after the meal gives a good idea of how your body has reacted to the meal. The blood sugar ranges recommended by NICE are as follows: Blood glucose ranges for type 2 diabetes Before meals: 4 to 7 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 8.5 mmol/l Blood glucose ranges for type 1 diabetes (adults) Before meals: 4 to 7 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 9 mmol/l Blood glucose ranges for type 1 diabetes (children) Before meals: 4 to 8 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 10 mmol/l However, those that are able to, may wish to keep blood sugar levels below the NICE after meal targets. Access to blood glucose test strips The NICE guidelines suggest that people newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes should be offered: structured education to every person and/or their carer at and around the time of diagnosis, with annual reinforcement and review self-monitoring of plasma glucose to a person newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes only as an integral part of his or her self-management education Therefore both structured education and self-monitoring of blood glucose should be offered to people with type 2 diabetes.

I felt my pens gave me a chance to ""disconnect"" from diabetes between injections. However, I was frequently experiencing hypos during and after exercise, which is a large part of my life. The turning point that made me decide to go for it was two-fold: 1. finally understanding how a pump worked by allowing me to change the basal rate for an hour or more at a time. This allows me to change my basal needs at different times of the day and ad hoc when I exercise. 2.being told I could give it back if I didn't like it. This seems simple but realising I could try it out without before the rest of my life to being attached was very important ... although I never gave it back. I have now been pumping for more than two years. Am I used to it? I am used to changing sets (cannula and insulin), I am used to having my insulin with me all the time, I am used to packing stacks of spares when I go away, I am used to tweaking my basal rates, I am used to dialling up my carbs and seeing the insulin go in, I am used to taking a BG reading and dialling this in to make a correction. I am not used to having to worry about where to put something the size of a pack of cards. I am relatively small (about 55kg) and vain so I dislike that it is on show most of the time. No one seems to notice but I feel I am advertising my diabetes. As critical pieces of kit, they are very thoroughly tested to ensure they do not over dose. But just like when on MDI, there is little to stop user-error. If you tell it you ate 40g carbs when you meant to tell it you ate 20g, it will overdose (although, if you are quick you may be able to cancel the dose). The start of pumping is probably the worst part: it is the time when you are getting used to being attached, to changing sets, etc. and the time when your settings are being sorted. The great thing about the pump is it is so configurable: different basal rates for different times of the day, different correction rates for different times of the day, different insulin to carb ratios for different times of the day, ... The bad thing is it is so configurable so you have a chance to get so many things slightly off and need some trial and error to get it right. Once, it is set up correctly (give yourself a month or so or tweaking), it is worth the effort and, unless you are incredibly vain like me, you probably won't notice it most of the time.",

How about trying low carb or fasting but doing it with a mindset that this is my lifestyle from now on. If you make changes that you can stick to (because you are not hungry or craving sweet stuff) then you will not be so easily derailed when something difficult happens like that injury or any of the other things that can and do happen to people. The fact that 'feeling sorry for yourself' led to a junk binge tells me that your regime wasn't right for you before because you could not stick to it indefinitely. Whatever you do next should work in the long term otherwise you will be yo yoing around/falling on and off waggons too much. Try LCHF in your own way and keep checking the bgs to motivate you but also ask yourself things like How are my energy/hunger levels?/Cravings etc. to find the right way to do it for you.

As a T1D, not as professional advice or opinion: do you have a glucose meter to monitor your blood sugar levels (BSLs) ? That way you can gauge what the addition of this long-acting insulin is doing to your BSLs. If not, since you are prescribed insulin, I believe the GP can order the strips and meter for you - but I bow to others' experience on this. (I assume you live in the UK) As the nurse mentioned, the insulin you are now taking could lower your BSLs. If you go to the Home page and Type 1 diabetes there is a topic called hypoglycaemia (hypo- = low, -gly- glucose, -aemia - in the blood, or hypo for short). You will see that hunger can be a symptom of hypos , so ideally doing a glucose meter reading (from a drop of blood gained by fingerprick) at the time of feeling hungry, or most hungry can give you an idea about whether your BSL is low or not. Definition of low BSL is a reading of either less than 4 mmol/l or less than 3.6 mmol/l. Sometimes people experience feelings of a hypo at higher readings like 5 or even 6 so if you are not sure you could always repeat the test say 10 minutes later. The article on hypoglycaemia also mentions what to do in a hypo, if you should ever experience symptoms as well and have a low reading. There are a number of long-acting insulins: one lasts in its BSL-lowering effect for 12 to 20 hours or so, another for 20 to 24 hours, and others longer. A number of these have a fairly even effect on BSL over the time they work for but others can tend to have a mild peak on BSL-lowering ability partway through the time they are active. If your insulin has such a peak, that may tend to be the time when a low BSL may be more likely to occur. So please let us know here what insulin you have ben prescribed and ask your DSN what effect your particular insulin is likely to have on your BSLs in terms of time after its injection. As others have suggested you will need to wait for the blood test results before knowing more about whether insulin is the best next thing or some other treatment. Best Wishes",

This costs 687. After that, the sensors cost 275 for a pack of 5, or 525 for a pack of 10 and they last around 6 days. From what I've read the Minimed ones aren't very good for lasting longer than the time stated. If you don't have an insulin pump, you'd need the Guardian too (which is basically just a standalone CGM device which your sensors link to instead of to the pump), and the cost to buy the that with the CGM starter kit is 1599 on promotion at the moment (it says it ended on 25th April but they were still running it last week). I'd mentioned in the email that I was concerned it was out of my price range and did they have any suggestions re: funding, and if I decided to go for it did they do any sort of trial period, but they didn't offer any advice on that front unfortunately. Having read more online, it seems the Dexcom is more popular because they're cheaper to run, the sensors last longer and I hear they're more accurate. It seems that some people are able to get CGM funded by their local hospital, but I guess it's just a case of whether you're lucky enough to live in the right area- I can't get it at mine- but I believe it's worth asking. Apparently the best way to go about it is to weigh up the pros and cons, and if CGM could prevent serious hypos (if you have reduced awareness for example) and/or hospital admissions, and/or could save money because you're getting through a ridiculous amount of blood testing strips at present, then it's definitely worth a shot. You have to essentially present a case to them for how CGM could be the most efficient option in your case, and hope that they agree! Also, if you're interested in trialling it out, most hospitals will allow you to loan one just for 6 days, to get a clearer picture of what's going on with your blood sugars. I'd recommend trying that before considering forking out to pay for one if that's what it comes to! Good luck (and let us know how you get on) Sarah",

I have had some better weeks, some worse weeks. My problem is the last 4-5 days I have had wild swings in my blood sugar. Example: Last night I took 50 units of Lantus, ( my doctors recommended dose), at 8PM. My reading was 425mg, (23.6mmol).(By the way like I said I have been having swings so this is not normal, even for me). I took no Novolog , (short term), because of issues the last 4 days. I felt my blood sugar changing so I took a reading at 10Pm. I was at 60mg,(3.3mmol). I drank some O.J. and ate 8 chocolate covered Peanut Butter pretzels to raise it. I checked my blood sugar again at 1130PM and it was back up to 496mg, (27.6mmol). I did not expect it to go that high from just what little bit I had. I was afraid to take any short term, Novolog, just before going to sleep in case it dropped me too far since it had been acting differently on me than before, like it was more potent. I woke up around 3am and ate an ice cream bar and went back to sleep. When I woke up at 9am my blood sugar was 55mg, (3.1mmol). I drank some coffee with creamer and drank one small glass of O.J.. I checked it at 11:33am and it had only went up to 70mg, (3.9mmol). Since then I have eaten breakfast and have had more O.J. to drink and haven't checked it since. The highs and lows have been happening the last 4-5 days. I am going to the doctors tomorrow to have this checked out. I did some research and think maybe I have gotten brittle diabetes. How dangerous is this? Has anyone else had an issue like this? Any advice? I am new to this group, I just joined today so sorry if I am in wrong forum or have broken any rules with this post.",

So long as the person posting those scientific 'proven' 'facts' doesn't get defensive when there are numerous people whose experiences contradict them. Most of these 'scientific and repeatedly proven facts' are quoted from studies which have rigorous selection processes and reject the large number of people who don't fit their test criteria - the people with multiple health issues, or who depend on medication which may affect the results. There are usually age, weight, and other restrictions to the selection process too. Consequently, such 'facts' may be applicable to those individuals selected for the study, but because large numbers of people are automatically excluded from the study means that the 'facts' are not proven to apply across the board.

Test your fasting BS in a morning before you eat or drink and that will give you a guide. The best test for a diabetic is the HbA1c which can only be done by your GP sending a blood sample to the lab for testing. This will give you an average reading over the last 3 months and so avoids the highs and lows of self testing. Sent from the Diabetes Forum App,

Well may LCHF or Keto be denigrated as fad diets. But with all the current bias directed at the obesity / diabetes epidemic it is very hard to filter out a normal diet as a life long skinny living on sugar. Some carbs are necessary to moderate the livers glycogen reserves & preserve adrenal function. Lots of green leafy vegetables are good but we also need some carbs to provide the prebiotic fibre for a healthy varied gut biome. I adapted a more frequent, small meal plan.

The Nurse who first gave me the diagnosis went to great lengths at that time to point out that Diabetes is non reversible and I will be classed as diabetic for the rest of my life. When I next saw her after getting my sugars under control and in an area they were happy with she congratulated me then quickly followed up with the comment that diabetes was degenerative and that controlling it by diet would only put off the eventual need for medication. My results for the last 2 years have been between 53 & 55 which from the info Daisy has supplied would suggest it is slightly higher than what would be desirable but at least the have remained constant. As I say I have been praised and chastised for these results by different Nurses/Doctors and that's where my confusion comes in. At present although I control by diet it has not been that strict with regards to the carbs I take, I still use for example white rice/bread and normal pasta.

I do have a monitor from when you got a freebie without being on meds , but have rarely used it since free strips were stopped. ( Just tried and it reads 7.2, but the strips are out of date). I think that is when the rot started, as I used to test about once a week.Then the odd sweeter thing sneaked in (ie sponge pudding or icecream for dessert ) as there was no way of seeing any effect. In the last year, I've tend to add a bit more and a bit more sweet treat, especially when bored, due to pain reducing my movement/exercise and nothing has shown up in the MOT until now (well nothing that's been commented on). My trouble is that I don't like food and don't have a large appetite, so my diet is restricted even before considering what I eat . I used to get lots of diabetes recipe books from the library, but the foods were all alien to me, as I don't like spicy food or pasta. Also, my back problem makes preparing meals a long drawn out task, so when the meals ready I've my appetite and a husband who is very fussy about what he will eat doesn't help, when you are only preparing meals for two. Maybe it's my odd taste buds, but vegetables don't taste nice (too bitter or too sweet) . I used to like tiny sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower and carrots (but I've had some horrid ones lately), so that leaves peas and green beans .Fruit (especially apples and nectarines) seems tasteless and I've had to return to lots of oranges as they were either dry or had too tough to chew segments. I have tried wholemeal breads, but don't like the nutty taste or find them dry. I saw a dietician, 6 years ago, who said my diet wasn't bad, but I've gone off some of the foods since then (ie horrid veg , tasteless meats and even eggs lack flavour). She recommend eating anything, except sweets, in moderation, though she said a snack size Mars bar was an ok treat ( I don't like Mars bars so no danger of large ones) and didn't suggest cutting well down on carbs. When my late dad was diagnosed, in his late 70s, he said he saw little point in existence if he could only have horrible food. I'm not house bound like he was (He had Parkinsons), but partly see his point. For breakfast I have a yoghurt or some flake cereal with dried fruit (gave up on Special K when they made it sweet). Lunch can be soup or a sandwich, with an occasional Weighwatchers frozen meal. By evening meal, I'm struggling to find anything I want, so often feed my husband and do without or steal a couple of chips from his plate. At bedtime a rich tea or digestive biscuit with my tea, but not every day. I think I'm going through the feeling sorry for oneself, as on first diagnosis and probably because my neurology consultation ,yesterday resulted in tests for more possible ailments (increased hypothyroid and possible osteoporosis), but didn't cover things I hoped to discuss (felt a little fobbed off after just 10minutes,when I usually have over 30) , so I'll bounce back at some stage....if I don't starve to death. PS Any suggestions for yummy food for someone as fussy as me ? ie tasty, not spicy, satisfying but not over filling ? .",

They should provide time off for scheduled appointments, allow you time in the day to administer insulin and check your BG levels. There should be an appropriate place to do this (I just do it at my desk). Keeping snacks and hypo treatments with you should also be allowed. A number of companies I know are a bit more lenient on sick days - but if you are having a lot then you aren't managing your diabetes well.

Just had conflab with SDN who has cut insulin down to 6u am and 4u pm (honeymooning, moi?). She is aware I am desperate for control but the cut is due to 4's most afternoons and a lovely hypo today at the same time. However the cut at night time is because I am going to bed in the 5's at times (though not always) and she says that for a newly diagnosed the control is 'too tight' :?: When I queried this reasoning she said gold standard pre bed was around 7. preferably 8 and otherwise as long as bg was not over 10 that this would be fine for now. When I queried how long they would keep me at non diabetic levels of bg I was advised that I was not to worry about this as when honeymoon period ended my requirments would go up. Is it just me? Is she right that newbies are preferred not to have readings like this already? I am only staring to try as I mean to go on (lectured again for not eating gigantic plates of pasta if I want). She says she knows I want tight control but it is too soon to be at this level. Am frustrated and feel quite despondent now. Am glad insulin is cut but not to expense of high bg. BTW they havent all been at 4-7, some are still over this (almost 50/50 over test period of 9 days).

I also savoured each and every mouthful of food I ate at mealtimes, eating slowly and putting my knife and fork down between mouthfuls, chewing every mouthful and telling myself how good it was not to have snacked before I ate. I always set aside time for my meals when I wasnt being distracted by anything else so I could just concentrate on enjoying every mouthful, I never eat ""on the go"" as I used to, I didnt read, watch TV or even listen to music, my meals were a time of self imposed relaxation.

Sometimes, depending largely on what you have eaten, but also on general health and activity, you produce more insulin than the sugars in your system require and so you go hypo. Not a good idea, if driving!! Metformin works differently. It discourages the body's own production of sugars, but only very slightly. Officially it is not possible to hypo on Met, but there are members here who say they have gone too low on it, but this is a rarity. Because, officially, you can't hypo on Met and in practice are very, very unlikely to do so, there is no need to test. Having said all that, I would say that you should be testing your blood sugars - before and after meals to see what puts up your blood sugar and then avoid it in future. Your doctor will tell you that s/he will test you once a year and home testing is unnecessary, but this will not tell you what was wrong/right about what you did over the previous months. So, my advice is to keep testing, but not for the purpose of driving. Sally",

So for me LCHF has meant a big attitude shift towards food. Especially when low-fat, high-carb was what lost me 100lbs in the first place (although clearly my BG didn't like it...)

Our bloods do change. There are rules to follow for high's.. Does your son follow these rules? Ie A) over 12, and you may well have to give more correction dose? B) Check the needle inside the connector if using rapid d's.... These can bend without necessarily knowing it. I only got told this a couple months ago after 4 years of accuchek pumping. Apparently that is a large reason for unknown highs. C) change everything as soon as an unexplained high occurs. I man everything. D) finally going to use a pen to deliver a correction dosage. E) testing at least every 2 hours at least, even when sleeping F) if the sets are a tad uncomfy when putting in, does he still put them in or does he change area? If they aren't 100% comfy then my logic is ""with any pain, set change. Finally, some sets can be faulty... Or hitting bad sites, or the lueur lock has become loosened accidentally. I had a batch of tubes which the lueur locks loosened and caused hassle. I had a number of sets that caused problems. I always report every problem to accuchek if it isn't my fault. They take a note of batch numbers, what you have done etc and will listen to you and if there are problems will send you replacement sets /tubes or even pump if necessary. It is important to tell accuchek if you have unexplained highs and they aren't down to a bad site, blood in tube etc. Also, flexlink plastic sets don't always give 100% good readings... For me and others I know of the rapid d's do give more consistent readings and less occlusions. Most people I know also use their 6mm rapid d sets. Don't get me wrong, you can still get problems and I have reported them from day one myself from when I realised a set (since withdrawn) was faulty....",

My question is this: I am not diabetic but 3 years ago had a health check and was found to have high blood pressure. sometime later I discovered that the HbA1c taken as part of the check had been 42 yet nobody had said anything to me, they just focussed on the blood pressure. I was alarmed and they gave me another test expecting it to be lower as I had altered my life style somewhat in regard to the blood pressure. It was exactly the same but they said not to worry I wasn't diabetic - ""Just watch your diet"" I was told. No instructions, just watch it !! About a year later I had another test, for the blood pressure drugs I think, and this time it was 39. So I am wondering, why was the forum reader still considered a diabetic with an A1c of 38 and not eligible for removal from the register until it dropped to 32?

I am scared of untold damage or uncontrolled diabetes if they wont test for a year, and dismiss my meter readings as me being over anxious and making a fuss. She tests my urine once a month, but that stops after the next visit, then no test until my annual checkup. Their view is that it is a very slowly developing disease, so there is no need to hurry or monitor. Any problems will be picked up annually. So my prescribed drug regime of 1 x Metformin is cast in stone for a year before tests and a possible adjustment. Maybe I am worrying too much about possible damage. I dont know if I am. I think keeping being told I am over-anxious has caused me to doubt myself and my own perceptions.",

I think it really would be best if you could test for ketones because the events you describe don't make much sense, leaving me to question whether you can accurately tell that you have ketones - if your BG levels are normally OK then you would not expect a carb binge to result in ketones: ketones are released when cells are starving because they can't use the preferred fuel, glucose, for energy (either in people who eat very little carbs or diabetics who don't have insulin cells need to utilise the glucose in the bloodstream); in response to that the body dumps more glucose in the bloodstream (because cells are reporting that there isn't any) and you get DKA with sky-high blood glucose *regardless* of what you eat. When you binge on carbs it's a different: there is enough insulin for cells to use glucose but not enough insulin to move all the glucose into storage, resulting in high BG. Whilst less immediately fatal this still causes damage to blood vessels ultimately leading to the classical diabetic complications. Since your BG is normally OK and was OK the morning after I think that this is the case (I.e. I think you are wrong about having ketones) you should have been told by your doctor, and he'd be the person to see but if you are not happy to do that then you should be able to ketone test strips or ketostixs at a pharmacy without prescription. They are needed for exactly this kind of situation - to tell if high BG reading is due to a carb binge (not an emergency) or absolute insulin deficit (emergency)",

Stage 1 is triggered by amylase enzyme in the mouth reacting to sugar and as it were predigesting it before it hits the stomach after swallowing. This in turn triggers Stage 1 Response which is a fast acting shot of insulin designed to deal with glucose intake. It is short lived compared to stage 2 which deals with the long term bump due to general carb digestion, There may be a stage 3 associated with proteins turning into glucose but that could just be an extension of stage 2. One thing about T2D is that it seems it is stage 1 that goes AWOL first, and we become prone to sugar spikes. Stage 2 can also go wrong since this is the one that ought to keep on going until all is safely gathered in, but things happen to confuse it so that it may not turn off when it should, or turns off too early, It is this enzyme controlled process that is susceptible to metabolic syndrome, and which modern eating habits and gut flora affect greatly by interfering with these enzymes. Grazing or snacking on the fly leads to confusion since it can prolong Stage 2, Artificial sweetners are aslo suspected of triggering false stage 1 responses and all of these combine to promote hypeinsulaemia or continuous insulin demand from the pancreas. This is why intermittent fasting should be considered as treatment, and why snacks must be avoided. Processed foods tend to haveadded sugars or artificial sweetners added and these compound the problem not just by adding sugars but giving false triggers and possibly altering gut flora long term,",Stephen Lewis said: I agree with @Resurgam . I tried low GI last year before I heard about low carb. All it did was to spread a medium-high bg over a longer period. I do not like spikes but I prefer a high of 9.5 an hour after a meal then down to 7.5 an hour later than 8.5 for 5 or 6 hours that I was getting with the low GI. I think this indicates that my pancreas can react to a spike but not to a steady stream of carbs. You may be different. Click to expand...

If we give some suggestions as to what we all eat in a typical day you may see some things you would like to try and hopefully find some that make you feel better. Breakfast I love maybe 6 strawberries, a no sugar jelly sprinkled with chopped nuts, topped off with either double cream or Total Greek Yogurt (other yogurts are available but this is pretty low carbed). This fills me up and keeps the hunger pangs at bay for quite a while. Lunch A salad with plenty of cheese and maybe ham, tuna, prawns, a dollop of some deli sandwich filler or whatever is about. A handful of nuts (almonds, walnuts and brazils....good for cholesterol). Maybe a slice of Burgen bread (if you can tolerate bread) or a low carb crispbread. Maybe a homemade low carb cake if I have some made. Evening meal Meat (I love steaks) or fish (portions without batter or breadcrumbs....check out Birds Eye or Tesco bake in the bag portions...lovely!!) with vegetables.....cauliflower and a few peas go well with fish. Mushrooms and salad goes well with a steak. If you must have potato just have 3 or 4 small new potatoes or 6 or 8 chips, no big portions else you will be hungry and feel bad again.

I have to also cut the fats. In a low carb diet you are poring in the protein and that is why you lose weight. As your response indicates you may not have enough insulin release to warrant a hormone release. People with my genetics are putting out the hormones most of the time. I do not change sugar into fat when I process protein. When my blood sugar gets high my body cuts the hormones. In a glucose tolerance test I put out enough insulin to somewhat control my blood sugar but my body tests and only makes a large release of insulin when I have become less insulin resistance. People with my genetics wait over an hour during a glucose tolerance test before our bodies decide a major insulin release is justified. Women with my genetics are diabetic while pregnant. That is necessary since the method we use to stop the hormones would effect the same or very similar hormones produced in the placenta. Click to expand...

Ask as many questions as you want and someone will be able to help. BASIC INFORMATION FOR NEW MEMBERS Diabetes is the general term to describe people who have blood that is sweeter than normal. A number of different types of diabetes exist. A diagnosis of diabetes tends to be a big shock for most of us. Its far from the end of the world though and on this forum you'll find well over 210,000 people who are demonstrating this. On the forum we have found that with the number of new people being diagnosed with diabetes each day, sometimes the NHS is not being able to give all the advice it would perhaps like to deliver - particularly with regards to people with type 2 diabetes. The role of carbohydrate Carbohydrates are a factor in diabetes because they ultimately break down into sugar (glucose) within our blood. We then need enough insulin to either convert the blood sugar into energy for our body, or to store the blood sugar as body fat. If the amount of carbohydrate we take in is more than our bodys own (or injected) insulin can cope with, then our blood sugar will rise. The bad news Research indicates that raised blood sugar levels over a period of years can lead to organ damage, commonly referred to as diabetic complications . The good news People on the forum here have shown that there is plenty of opportunity to keep blood sugar levels from going too high. Its a daily task but its within our reach and its well worth the effort. Controlling your carbs The info below is primarily aimed at people with type 2 diabetes, however, it may also be of benefit for other types of diabetes as well. There are two approaches to controlling your carbs: Reduce your carbohydrate intake Choose better carbohydrates Reduce your carbohydrates A large number of people on this forum have chosen to reduce the amount of carbohydrates they eat as they have found this to be an effective way of improving (lowering) their blood sugar levels. The carbohydrates which tend to have the most pronounced effect on blood sugar levels tend to be starchy carbohydrates such as rice, pasta, bread, potatoes and similar root vegetables, flour based products (pastry, cakes, biscuits, battered food etc) and certain fruits. Choosing better carbohydrates The low glycaemic index diet is often favoured by healthcare professionals but some people with diabetes find that low GI does not help their blood sugar enough and may wish to cut out these foods altogether. Read more on carbohydrates and diabetes . Over 145,000 people have taken part in the Low Carb Program - a free 10 week structured education course that is helping people lose weight and reduce medication dependency by explaining the science behind carbs, insulin and GI. Eating what works for you Different people respond differently to different types of food. What works for one person may not work so well for another. The best way to see which foods are working for you is to test your blood sugar with a glucose meter. To be able to see what effect a particular type of food or meal has on your blood sugar is to do a test before the meal and then test after the meal. A test 2 hours after the meal gives a good idea of how your body has reacted to the meal. The blood sugar ranges recommended by NICE are as follows: Blood glucose ranges for type 2 diabetes Before meals: 4 to 7 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 8.5 mmol/l Blood glucose ranges for type 1 diabetes (adults) Before meals: 4 to 7 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 9 mmol/l Blood glucose ranges for type 1 diabetes (children) Before meals: 4 to 8 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 10 mmol/l However, those that are able to, may wish to keep blood sugar levels below the NICE after meal targets. Access to blood glucose test strips The NICE guidelines suggest that people newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes should be offered: structured education to every person and/or their carer at and around the time of diagnosis, with annual reinforcement and review self-monitoring of plasma glucose to a person newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes only as an integral part of his or her self-management education Therefore both structured education and self-monitoring of blood glucose should be offered to people with type 2 diabetes.

You should find insulin has no effect on moods or anything except blood sugar; it has very few side effects. If you are not overweight and struggling with blood sugar control with tablets then insulin can be a real release; it was for me. If you are overweight then be careful as it implies you are having too many carbs and with insulin that may cause weight gain. My DN gave me a the DVLA form and signed it before I sent it off. My new 3 year licence came thru very quickly. I was started on just Basal (24 hr) once a day but within a few weeks the DN and I agreed to add Bolus (Rapid) as well to give better sugar control which currently means around 3-4 shots a day. For me it's been very easy but you do need to remember to test before driving which is nuisance.,

I have had Psoriasis for 42 yrs, but there was nothing much to see except for the odd couple of patches here and there. But, I had used Steriod based creams for about 25 years plus. I was diagnosed Type 2 in 2000 (16 years) and it was in 2002 that my LFT blood Tests started going up and coming down, and my Psoriasis changed into something with a vengeance every time it erupted. At that time I was on a drug called Acitretin and remained on that for a good 5years or more. It seems with me drugs work for so long and then suddenly stop. I took Methotrexate tablets 25mg and folic acid tablets for 18 months - it cleared my Psoriasis, but then stopped working. Next began using the Biological Injections. First it was Stelara used it for 18myths and cleared my skin 99% but had 5 chest Infections and 5 Antibiotic courses in 8 months, so it got stopped.Found out I had Aneamia and was put on iron tablets (still taking them 4 yrs later) Then went onto using Humira for 9 months, this brought out pain in all my joints and the Psoriasis erupted worse than ever before. My LFT blood tests were going erratic but ignored by Doctors. Then went onto Cosentyx (biological) and have been on this since March this year and my Psoriasis is slowly erupting. Was referred to see a Rheumatologist in January as I have Arthritis - but Rheumatologist does not know which type? At first she though Psoriatic Arthritis, but changed her mind. So having more tests done: X Rays and Bone Scans. Dermatologist referred me in February this year to see a Liver Specialist as my LFT blood tests were going crazy. Have had Fibroscan got a score of 10, had Ultrasound Abdominal Scan, had MRI Liver Scan with Contrast and was told there is something wrong with my Liver. So had Liver Biopsy 3 weeks ago and 2 weeks ago got the diagnosis Fibrosis with NAFLD. I don't drink Alcohol and used to be a vegetarian up until a year ago. I weigh 13 stone and was told to lose another stone or more and follow a low fat diet. And try Milk Thistle tablets.",

Do you use Carbs and Cals? I don't myself but I know many Type 1s find it useful. Lentils are low GI and because they do swell up, as you've said, you don't need too many too thicken a soup or stew. I don't know if you've done DAFNE?",

First the needles and now this, things just keep getting worse","runner2009 said: I've had just the same sensation, but what it seems to me that I've hit a nerve cell right on the head, if I move slightly over often it doesn't hurt on the new skin area. As for the questions about the study, no offense taken. I know nothing about it and it could be rubbish like many studies are. It basically said there was little if any risk for reusing pen needles and mirrored my own experience and what was told to me by the free community clinic MDs. I've personally taken needle nose pliers to pen needles and those needles are tough little buggers. The only time I won't use them if they are bent or I can't prime it with a unit or two - I've not used new ones that won't prime. Actually I believe this reusing issue is really a non issue especially when considering the plethora of other serious issues facing us diabetics - like shrinking brains (-; Thx you for reiterating the forum philosophy of sharing experiences and not being overly harsh to members when they do ask questions and share their experiences. This forum IMO is a incredible resource and for most part a safe place to share and learn without fear of being critiqued. I remember when I was first diagnosed, after a week in Hospital with a H1AC of 13.6 - didn't even know what that meant. I was so afraid and overwhelmed and alone. I only wish I had discovered the forum sooner. I do hope that the woman who started this thread returns as she seemed to be very dedicated in controlling her diabetic condition and I am sure she has a lot to contribute.

Postage is half a dollar. They do ship overseas - I put their UK prices into a money converter for you.,Nyxks said: meter are between 5 n 50 bucks (or free if you buy 100 strips or get them from the parent company directly) its the test strips that cost almost 80 bucks per 100 pack if you are a senior drop 15% from that but other wise no suck luck for a discount in general ...
