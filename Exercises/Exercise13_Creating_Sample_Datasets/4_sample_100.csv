I am enormously grateful to several Type 1s in my life who have been supportive since day 1, two of whom sought me out at work as soon as the gossip grapevine had got to work post diagnosis and made it abundantly clear they would be supportive any way they could, as they'd always appreciated the support I'd apparently given on some of their difficult days.They never make me bad about being Type 2 as we respect each other's struggles and don't try to give inappropriate advice.",

Ask questions and someone will be able to help. BASIC INFORMATION FOR NEW MEMBERS Diabetes is the general term to describe people who have blood that is sweeter than normal. A number of different types of diabetes exist. A diagnosis of diabetes tends to be a big shock for most of us. Its far from the end of the world though and on this forum you'll find well over 147,000 people who are demonstrating this. On the forum we have found that with the number of new people being diagnosed with diabetes each day, sometimes the NHS is not being able to give all the advice it would perhaps like to deliver - particularly with regards to people with type 2 diabetes. The role of carbohydrate Carbohydrates are a factor in diabetes because they ultimately break down into sugar (glucose) within our blood. We then need enough insulin to either convert the blood sugar into energy for our body, or to store the blood sugar as body fat. If the amount of carbohydrate we take in is more than our bodys own (or injected) insulin can cope with, then our blood sugar will rise. The bad news Research indicates that raised blood sugar levels over a period of years can lead to organ damage, commonly referred to as diabetic complications . The good news People on the forum here have shown that there is plenty of opportunity to keep blood sugar levels from going too high. Its a daily task but its within our reach and its well worth the effort. Controlling your carbs The info below is primarily aimed at people with type 2 diabetes, however, it may also be of benefit for other types of diabetes as well. There are two approaches to controlling your carbs: Reduce your carbohydrate intake Choose better carbohydrates Reduce your carbohydrates A large number of people on this forum have chosen to reduce the amount of carbohydrates they eat as they have found this to be an effective way of improving (lowering) their blood sugar levels. The carbohydrates which tend to have the most pronounced effect on blood sugar levels tend to be starchy carbohydrates such as rice, pasta, bread, potatoes and similar root vegetables, flour based products (pastry, cakes, biscuits, battered food etc) and certain fruits. Choosing better carbohydrates The low glycaemic index diet is often favoured by healthcare professionals but some people with diabetes find that low GI does not help their blood sugar enough and may wish to cut out these foods altogether. Read more on carbohydrates and diabetes . Over 145,000 people have taken part in the Low Carb Program - a free 10 week structured education course that is helping people lose weight and reduce medication dependency by explaining the science behind carbs, insulin and GI. Eating what works for you Different people respond differently to different types of food. What works for one person may not work so well for another. The best way to see which foods are working for you is to test your blood sugar with a glucose meter. To be able to see what effect a particular type of food or meal has on your blood sugar is to do a test before the meal and then test after the meal. A test 2 hours after the meal gives a good idea of how your body has reacted to the meal. The blood sugar ranges recommended by NICE are as follows: Blood glucose ranges for type 2 diabetes Before meals: 4 to 7 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 8.5 mmol/l Blood glucose ranges for type 1 diabetes (adults) Before meals: 4 to 7 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 9 mmol/l Blood glucose ranges for type 1 diabetes (children) Before meals: 4 to 8 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 10 mmol/l However, those that are able to, may wish to keep blood sugar levels below the NICE after meal targets. Access to blood glucose test strips The NICE guidelines suggest that people newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes should be offered: structured education to every person and/or their carer at and around the time of diagnosis, with annual reinforcement and review self-monitoring of plasma glucose to a person newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes only as an integral part of his or her self-management education Therefore both structured education and self-monitoring of blood glucose should be offered to people with type 2 diabetes.

Anything made with dough or fruit or something will be high in carbs, and that does add up to the numbers you experienced. (Without the walk they probably would've been higher, so that walk was a good call!) I've tried antidepressants since I was 13 years old. They gave me migraines every single day for little over a year. (My shrink called me an obstinate quitter. I was puking my brains out daily, couldn't go to school...). Also, something that wasn't known then, in the time where prozac was still hailed as a miracle-drug: kids in puberty get more suicidal on prozac. That stuff made me very positive about death. I barely survived that, and have the hospitalrecords to prove it. Later, as an adult, I tried anti-depressants again, with various medicatons. When I finally found one that didn't give me migraines and allowed me to sleep, my eyesight got worse. My eyes hurt like heck. And then I found out my rheumatologist never put on record that I have Sjgrens, because I never should've been put on that antidepressant because it could've cost me the use of my eyes. And that's just the antidepressants. (So yes, probably like you, I'm hanging on by my fingernails as a way of life.) I'm extremely susseptable to side-effects, to any medication, so you can guess what happened on metformin: I lived in the loo for weeks. That's when I went searching for an alternative and found low carb. I wasn't as high as you, but there's T2's out there who were on insulin, and could stop that because of a low carb diet. So I totally get where you're coming from, and yeah, a low carb (not low-ish, but proper low carb!), can help you, in a way where there could very well be no meds required. Can't guarantee anything, but the odds are with you on this one.

I can't comment on the effect of coffee but small things can trigger a short-term change in the metabolism. I wouldn't worry about it or stop the coffee. To continue to avoid medication you must control or continue to control the carbs; particularly if you are overweight and insulin resistant. If you are not overweight you may have deteriorating islet cells and, I'm afraid, will need medication at some future point. Are you overweight?",

Before visiting the hospital I had been prescribed Amytriptiline which made it very difficult to get up in the morning and was pretty ""zombiefying"".

I also use capsaicin and find it invaluable. You have to be careful with it, in fact I think that I have only just got it absolutely right after about nine years.

Having read about the numbers of people struggling with Lantus has anyone out there got experience of another Bolus that can be split am/pm as I work weird shift patterns on the railway!!! Click to expand... Do you meal basal? Bolus is rapid-acting insulin for meals, basal is long-acting background insulin (that's what Lantus is ) You might need to change your basal rate, it happens sometimes that your dosage changes over time. I highly recommend trying this: https://mysugr.com/basal-rate-testing/ See what results you get with this, then talk to your healthcare team about bumping up your dosage if needed. ickihun said: Ive been told nhs Sunderland want toujeo as uniform for type2s on insulin.

Im taking a mixed insulin so a 70% intermediate and 30% short acting.I think even nurse is hesitant over the dilemma of how to start me off.. Its making me nervous! Click to expand... Not sure I'd say it's triple the strength or anything, if you were taking 12 units of Lantus you'd take 12 units of Toujeo. The Toujeo pen has 450 units instead of 300 units like Lantus, so the Toujeo arguably lasts longer. It's just that the volume of the insulin is different, hence the increased units, and instead of 18-24 hours it lasts 36, so you don't have to split the dosage. Mixed insulin is useful if you you eat a specific amount of carbs at fixed times, but it's not very handy when you're on weird schedules or can't eat at the same time every day. Having separate injections for basal and bolus allows more flexibility, so it's something you'll have to figure out for yourself. It doesn't hurt to get started on the mixed insulin and see if that works for you. As far as I know, the type of diabetes you have doesn't define the type of insulin you need when you become insulin dependent. Lots of T1s and T2s for example share the same kind of insulin. It's just a matter of figuring out what works for your body and situation.",lukkymik said: Hi...

I'm worried of having diabetes and here's my story... Since July of last year I've been constantly worried about my health. The first thing that got me worried was that in the middle of the night I woke up sweating, had palpitations and couldn't breath properly. I was scared of heart attack. After 1 month or so started to have tingling on my left forearm (usually in the same place). Some days I had it, some days not. Later some kind of weak muscle and numbness developed in the left arm (Nothing big, I could lift things the same as before, but worried me). By the end of the year this episodes of sweating, palpitations and breath started again, mostly at night. I freak out again of hear attack and of dying. Since then it got worse...lost motivation at work, was constantly anxious/depressed, feeling tired, shakeness/tingling/numbess got worse, couldn't sleep properly, had episodes when I though I was going to faint, etc. Finally, by mid of April I collapsed (couldn't go on any more like this) and went for a full check-up (blood/urine test, heart ultra-sound, EKG, abdominal ultra-sound, chest x-rays), pretty sure that something terrible would come out. To my surprise everything came back normal (except for a few minor things, where results were borderline or by very little out of range. Thyroid TSH was just under normal level, but the doc wasn't worried...said it could be caused by stress). The endocrinologist prescribed a medication for sleep/palpitations (Vagostabyl) and Xanax 0.25mg to take it only when feeling anxious. I calmed down a bit, but now I'm worried of diabetes and numbess/tingling is back in my arms, body, a few days in my face also. The fasting glucose test I did was in the normal range, but very near the upper limit. However I have lost about 4kg in the last 3-4 months (dropped from 83 to 79) (during this time I haven't had the normal appetite, but have forced myself to eat more or less regularly (3 times a day)). Since I started googling (WRONG THING) I read read that weight loss, shakiness/numbess/tingling are symptoms of diabetes also. Another thing that's worrying me is that another symptom of diabetes was darkened skin in elbow, knees or neck. I checked carefully my body and noticed a small spot (a 4-5 mm) in my forearm but near the elbow (a few cm off) where the skin was more dark that the rest (nothing big, but noticeable) and I freaked out. I know that a fasting glucose test followed by a 2 hour check can exclude diabetes, but I'm so freaked out that can't go for a check. I read also that typical symptoms of diabetes are blurred vision, excessive thirst, feeling hungry and excessive urination which I don't have....however I can't get my mind clear I also read that usually diabetes start with the above symptoms and later numbness, tingling, shakeness, darkening of skin, etc are developed. Is it possible that the first symptoms are numbness, tingnling, shakeness, darkening of skin or it's my anxiety symptom that's driving my crazy? Any response is appreciated. Thank you",

In my working career I have been a buyer for different companies and would always negotiate the best price with suppliers. Why on earth aren't the NHS doing this with Abbott who supply the FL. I am sure if the price was lowered by Abbott they would sell more to be prescribed and let's face it it really comes down to money for CCG's as the proof of medical benefit and quality of life improvement is overwhelming. Just my thoughts but I am sure many of you will agree.,"Nursingstudent_ said: Hello everyone! I don't have diabetes, but as you can see by my name I am a nursing student and I study in the Netherlands. Currently, I am in my exam year and I have to do a research project about new innovations in the healthcare. Since this forum is global I wanted to reach out to a broad group of diabetics to make a world map and mark all the countries it's used in. My question is: Do you use the FreeStyle Libre and which country are you from? Also, is your FreeStyle Libre reimbursed or do you pay everything yourself + what do you pay? In The Netherlands, it's not reimbursed yet because of researches that are still going on. Users have to pay everything theirselves and the sensor costs 60 which you have to get twice a month and 20,- for 50 skintacs which are some sort of adhesives for the sensor to stick on the skin better. I would really appreciate your help and thank you all so much in advance! loves! Click to expand..."

Thanks for all the responses and advice. The cream was full fat and to be honest I've had trouble with some starch carbs raising my BG at 3 or 4 hours in the past (I'd forgotten about that ), so maybe I do need to consider more carefully how I take my Apidra dose. You're all also probably right that I need to chill out a bit about the odd spike - I spent a year misdiagnosed as Type 2 with my BG spiking very high whatever I ate, so I'm a bit paranoid about it. Perhaps the chocolate wasn't my brightest idea either, but it seemed too good an opportunity to miss :lol: Ah well, no real harm seems to have come of it. I guess I still have a lot to learn!

I am Type 2, diagnosed 9 years, diet controlled (badly) until 6 weeks ago when put on Metformin (500mg twice a day). I also eat lower carb. My levels have lowered but still higher than should be - recent HbA1c 7.6% down from 9%. So today I hadn't eaten a great amount, granola for brekkie and egg mayo lettuce wrap for lunch. At 4.40pm I suddenly felt panicky, dizzy, sweating. I think this was a false hypo - unfortunately I didn't have my meter with me so couldn't check my blood sugars. I ate 4 werthers sweets, a bit of a granola bar and a small sausage roll (all I could get my hands on). About 30 minutes after eating by bs was 7.2 - is there any way of extrapolating back to what my sugars were when I felt wobbly? So it's 2 hours later now and my sugars are now 11, but I still feel ill- I feel weak, nervous, and lightheaded - is this normal post hypo (I am aware this can't be a true hypo being type 2). If it's relevant I am pre menstrual. I have also stopped my citalopram medication after 10 years and started a different medication (venlafaxin) in the last 8 days. Any insight would be much appreciated. Thanks.",
