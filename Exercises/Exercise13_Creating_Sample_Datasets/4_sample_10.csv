This ought not to be refused. You can then pop down and collect it. Failing that, ask her what the glucose test and HbA1c (if there was one) were. Then you can let us know the figures and we can help you. Please never accept a medic's word that you are ""fine"" or ""OK"". Always ask for the results. You may well be within the normal range, but very much teetering on the edge or increasing test by test. The labs highlight any results outside the normal standard range, and these are all the doctors look at. They don't notice anything else.This is taking control of your own health, which these days we do need to do. We can all live healthier! Are you eating a lot of fruit, breakfast cereals, pasta and rice? If so, these are not healthy choices for diabetics. I will tag @daisy1 who has excellent information for newly diagnosed. Please take your time to read it and follow the links she gives, paying particular attention to the role of carbs. Let us know how you go on.",

Antibodies are all negative (although waiting for the rare results still). Have no symptoms, twice weekly fastings are late fours or very early fives. Had GDM with a two hour result of 11.2 in the GTT hence being monitored now. Hba1c is low too. Of course I may be grasping at straws. If the rare antibodies are negative then they will do a genetic test. Thanks",

The hba1c result is pretty accurate, and if he had a number of lows to go with the high sugar levels that could explain the result. I have noticed that if I don't wash my hands before a test I can get pretty erratic sugar levels! The main thing though is that he has a very good hba1c level, so that's a very good positive.",
