"this is not about whether the nhs should, or can afford to, provide test strips on a permanent or temporary basis to non-t1 diabetics."
"having read #everycloud s post, and so many more like it over the years on this forum, i wonder whether we could gather together examples of healthcare professionals who have told people that it is either unnecessary or just plain wrong to test their blood sugars."
it is a scandal that needs highlighting.
i intended this just as an unscientific attempt to get a rough sense of the nature and scale of the problem -- i'm sure that we can all agree that it is a serious issue.
anecdotal detail may be as useful as poll statistics in that sense.
i'm very aware that the issue is only raised if the newly diagnosed know to ask about testing in the first place -- in most cases it is possible that the issue never arises as testing is never mentioned by the hcp.
that makes a nonsense of nice guidelines about diabetes management.
"there are plenty of ways of then raising it as a point of broader concern, both within duk and elsewhere (i don't personally think an open letter would be the best way -- i would hope to use duk involvement network in the first instance -- but others may think differently)."
i would hope that this is a matter where we can all agree that we need to help our fellow-diabetics.
hi can anyone help please.
"i just had a finger prick blood test at the hosp last fri and the nurse said it was ""10""."
can someone tell me what this means on the scale of diabetic results?
thanks hi thanks everyone for your help.
i didn't put much info in my earlier post as i am new to this forum thing.
so here it is.
i was diagnosed with type 2 a couple of years ago (think my reading was about 90) but i am only know trying to learn more about it.
"at the time i was diagnosed i didn't get much information, my gp just told me to lose weight which i did on a low fat diet (lost 2 stone) and 6 months later he told me my results were normal (about 45)."
however after some bad family related news i gave up looking after myself and consequently put the weight back on.
i haven't been back to the docs for a while so he doesn't know this.
the finger prick test i had done at the hosp was part of pre-op testing for a completely unrelated op on my nose.
i am now trying to get back on the weight loss track and after finding this site recently have discovered that low carb / high protein seems to be recommended so that is the way i am going to go.
wish me luck !

what was your highest and lowest reading today?
"lowest: 138 mg/dl highest: 191 mg/dl not the best control, i try to achieve a tighter control with highest being 175 mg/dl but still increasing lantus."

naughty me
i have been reading up on protein and what the guide lines are for the amount we should eat on low carb.
it says 100 gems or 3.
"1/2 ounces, that seems very little."
i love my food and need to keep kidneys healthy.
so should i use these guidelines as i thought having no carbs one could eat what you want.
i am on pure lemon juice in water as soon as i get up and i can say it has curbed my desire for sweet food.
is it possible to buy a plate that has sections for protein veg and starch i think there used to be one think i need this plate friends.
but isnt meat all protein.
oh dear does that means that i have to know the protein of everything i eat and i can only have 100gms a day .
i thought protein was meat poultry fish any of that was protein gee i am doing it all wrong hmm ok thank you for this i am going to look into it further.
xxx thank you for this so grateful for all your help yes i do have chronic kidney disease stage 3 my kidneys are only work at 33 percent.
i was.
"told to give up salt which i have and although dictor says they are holding their own as he put it, i am trying to get things right in what i am eating to help them keep steady."
i know my doctor says they get worse as we age but.
i am trying to keep them going.

hello.
i think i have ask ask about this problem before but now it's much worst.
"i used to fall asleep after eating anything with sugar after about half an hour, now i am dropping off to sleep after eating anything and almost straight away."
i just did it to day had some cottage cheese and ham and when i finished just went to sleep it's like almost passing out i was sitting up looking on my pc.
it's horrible.
was wondering if anyone has this problem or what is making me do this?
my husband used to think it funny but now he doesn't it's worrying.
also i have a slight headache when i come round like a bit of a hangover.
i have one dr saying i'm prediabetic and another one at the hospital saying i'm not.
yes but you feel good when you wake up i feel dreadful.
are you prediabetic?
how long have you done this?
and is it after eating anything say cheese for instance no carbs?
thank you very much for your reply.
i do test my blood but only two hours after eating but next time i will test it when i feel sleepy and when i wake up good idea.
i know wheat gluten and sugar do make it a lot worst never eat wheat or gluten if i can help it.
sugar is a killer.
well let you know how it goes.
"hello all, i am after a bit of advice on an issue."
if anyone can give me any information that would be great as i know nothing on this subject.
i have just spoken to a doctors receptionist with regard to blood tests i had last week (no doctor available).
what she has told me has given me concern.
apparently i need to redo one of my tests and have a fasting blood test as the figure which i registered was 6.8.
is 6.8 high?
i had the blood test at 08:20 am just 30 minutes after eating two weetabix for breakfast.
i also had a cup of coffee.
no additional sugar was added to the weetabix or coffee.
i am a 39 year old male who weighs 11st 10lbs.
"i play football once per week, mountain bike once per week and eat and drink quite healthily."
"my father has diabetes and hypertension and i have been on medication for hypertension since being 29 years old, hence why i try to keep relatively fit and keep my weight down."
any advice or reassurance would be greatly appreciated.
thank you.
craig last week i had a 'fasting' blood test where the result came back as 5mmol/l.
"as i put in my original email, i knew nothing about diabetes but having read about it in the last week or so i am beginning to realise what kind of ailment it is and how much time and effort people have to spend to maintain their health."
many thanks for your answers.
cheers craig
"i looked to see if this was discussed before on this forum rather than starting a new thread, but seemed to get linked to threads about other illnesses."
i think this is connected to diabetes though.
sometimes after eating i get really hot.
so hot it's like a fever and you can feel the heat radiating out of the top of my head!
i get all red and my neck feels hot too.
it happens quite soon after a meal and can last an hour or so.
it doesn't always happen either.
googling has landed me with some quite alarming diagnoses that have nothing to do with food but i'm certain it's related to meals because of the timing.
"obvious next step is to ask the doctor, but wondered if it is something other people have experienced."
i'm type 2 newly diagnosed on lchf for about a month.
thankyou both!
"hello catherine, that certainly sounds like it!"
i don't like the suggestion that it could be linked to kidney problems but it did mention cheese and vinegar as triggers (and i had both before the last episode).
"jack, i've looked that up too and it's certainly a possibility."
i'm very new to diabetes and trying to avoid going on medication but so much is trial and error at this stage!
i'm keeping a diary of bg levels and food i eat.
i think i'll add hot flushes to this and see if i notice a pattern!
they have so far only taken my blood for bg tests.
in fact i've yet to see a doctor.
i was diagnosed and notified by a combination of the surgery receptionist and a nurse.
"i'm due back for the three month tests, and i'll go armed with questions!"
thank you gemma.
i had baked camembert (a whole one) with salad then not long after my head felt like a volcano!
so it could be.
"this is recent though, i didn't have this problem before."
i love cheese so rather hoping this isn't it i don't either!
but i will ask my doctor soon.
i had a small amount of cheese at lunchtime and ended up with a hot flush about half an hour later.
"but, i'm certain there was also vinegar in the salad so not very scientific!"
i may experiment with some cheddar in a moment...watch this space were you lol i love cheese.
it didn't seem to be the cheese this time gemma.
at least not cathedral city cheddar hope so!
"hi, lchf is promoted on this forum and with excellent results but i was just wondering why does the fat content have to be high?"
"as a t2 i struggle to tolerate sugar and carbs so this is what needs to be addressed, not sure why i need to seek to increase fats over and above those naturally present in diet regime that reduces carbs?"
"thanks @brunneria , just thinking the seeking 'high fat' message isn't quite correct, it's more don't unduly worry about the fat content thanks @mbaker , i like the 'healthy' fat branding much better than 'high' fat very helpful thank you @there is no spoon ."
i think the 'high fat' does spook some people especially if they have associated cholesterol issues so 'healthy' fat woks for me i recall when new to diagnosis reading posts on here about bullet proof coffee and when i looked up the recipe i felt instantly sick!!!
"healthy fat is a much gentler introduction for newbies guzzler said: i have bulletproof every morning, i love it but i had been diagnosed a year before i tried it because, like you, i was put off by the recipe and thought i might as well drink liquid lard!"
"but, like i say, i adore it."
"basically, we have two sources of fuel for the body and they are fats and carbohydrates."
if we cut down on one source of fuel it must be replaced by the other or we simply run out of fuel.
"the fats can come from two sources, that which we have stored in our bodies and that which we eat."
"it is logical to use excess fats stored in the body rather than to keep adding to those stored fats which just make us heavier and sicker but it is not dietary fats that add to our weight, it is the carbs that add to our stores and raise our bg to harmful levels."
the 'high fat' part of lchf is only high when directly compared to the (very) low fat diet we have come to think of as normal over the last few decades.
i have deliberately left out protein in this because protein has a far more important role in growth and repair and although it can be used as a fuel it is better suited to these purposes.
"as to cholesterol, the human body manufacturers it, in fact all but a couple of types of cells in the body can make it and it is vital for life."
dietary cholesterol (from animal fats) makes up at most 15% of total body cholesterol the other 85% is made by the body.
we can absorb a few plant sterols in passing but these are so few it is hardly worth mentioning.

"thanks, i'm not sure i'll take 'liquid lard' for breakfast anytime soon but hats off to you for going there and liking it"
hi all.
"newly diagnosed t1d here, about a month ago, with a hba1c of 124 on diagnosis."
clearly had been diabetic for months without realising.
i have had most of the required health checks done to ensure i did not do any damage with such a high hba1c for god knows how long.
the last think to check are my eyes.
"i mentioned getting an appointment to my dsn yesterday and she said i could just arrange it with any of the local opticians boots, specsavers etc... is that accurate?"
i was under the impression it had to be organised through the nhs and done in specialised nhs locations?
thanks for your help in advance!
ian my experience has not been great so far.
"was send to a&e by gp as had ketones in my urine and after a night on a drip and been shown how to use the insulin pens was discharged with basic info, they even tried to discharge me without my insulin as it was not ready and told me to pick it up the following day then i had to wait 5 weeks to see the dsn (been told it might be over 6 months to see the endocrinologist) and the meeting was not exactly useful so not too surprised she did not mention retinal screening until asked."
i also enquired about dafne course but was told it would be 6 months before she would put me on the list as they wanted to be sure about the type of diabetes i have.
this despite the fact i have never had a % body fat above 12% as i am an exercise nut and watch what i eat.
also i was positive on the antibody test so pretty clearly type 1.
"blood sugar levels are already under control at least, as i entered a honeymoon phase after a week on insulin, getting by on only a few units of basal and could probably get by without bolus at meals if i don't eat more than 30/40g of carbs."
i realise this wont last forever though.
i will talk to my gp he is usually pretty good so maybe he can refer me.
"to all our highly researched and well controlled diabetics on the forum when advising diabetics, even if it is in answer to a post by an experienced diabetic, please remember that this forum is read by newly diagnosed as well."
you may have got your numbers very low but for someone who is high then this is like shooting for the moon!
the advice to get to the nice guidelines is do-able for most newly diagnosed.
"once they get their levels down to that level, then they can try for the lower levels as, by this time, they will have got some idea on diet etc."
and more experience in just what diabetes is.
"similarly on diet, yes, you may have a diet that controls your diabetes successfully but did you start there?"
reducing down gradually is more likely to be permanent and a life style change than trying to go ultra- low immediately and perhaps failing and feeling guilty about it.
"on testing, please remember when you were first diagnosed."
newly diagnosed diabetics need to test frequently to find out what the food they are eating is doing to their blood sugar levels.this means testing before a meal and two hours after.
"testing after three hours is advised if eating food with a heavy fat content is eaten because fat slows down the absorption rate of some foods.one hour testing, looking for spikes in blood sugar can be useful as well."
newly diagnosed diabetics need time to acclimatise to their condition and small steps at a time are more likely to succeed than very large steps.
similarly advising that certain low numbers are ok just because you have attained them is very disheartening for someone confused and inexperienced.
being confused immediately after a diagnosis is very common.
