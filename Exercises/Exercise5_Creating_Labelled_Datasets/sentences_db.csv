"this is not about whether the nhs should, or can afford to, provide test strips on a permanent or temporary basis to non-t1 diabetics.",
"having read #everycloud s post, and so many more like it over the years on this forum, i wonder whether we could gather together examples of healthcare professionals who have told people that it is either unnecessary or just plain wrong to test their blood sugars.",
it is a scandal that needs highlighting.,
i intended this just as an unscientific attempt to get a rough sense of the nature and scale of the problem -- i'm sure that we can all agree that it is a serious issue.,
anecdotal detail may be as useful as poll statistics in that sense.,
i'm very aware that the issue is only raised if the newly diagnosed know to ask about testing in the first place -- in most cases it is possible that the issue never arises as testing is never mentioned by the hcp.,
that makes a nonsense of nice guidelines about diabetes management.,
"there are plenty of ways of then raising it as a point of broader concern, both within duk and elsewhere (i don't personally think an open letter would be the best way -- i would hope to use duk involvement network in the first instance -- but others may think differently).",
i would hope that this is a matter where we can all agree that we need to help our fellow-diabetics.,
hi can anyone help please.,
"i just had a finger prick blood test at the hosp last fri and the nurse said it was ""10"".",
can someone tell me what this means on the scale of diabetic results?,
thanks hi thanks everyone for your help.,
i didn't put much info in my earlier post as i am new to this forum thing.,
so here it is.,
i was diagnosed with type 2 a couple of years ago (think my reading was about 90) but i am only know trying to learn more about it.,
"at the time i was diagnosed i didn't get much information, my gp just told me to lose weight which i did on a low fat diet (lost 2 stone) and 6 months later he told me my results were normal (about 45).",
however after some bad family related news i gave up looking after myself and consequently put the weight back on.,
i haven't been back to the docs for a while so he doesn't know this.,
the finger prick test i had done at the hosp was part of pre-op testing for a completely unrelated op on my nose.,
i am now trying to get back on the weight loss track and after finding this site recently have discovered that low carb / high protein seems to be recommended so that is the way i am going to go.,
wish me luck !,

what was your highest and lowest reading today?,
"lowest: 138 mg/dl highest: 191 mg/dl not the best control, i try to achieve a tighter control with highest being 175 mg/dl but still increasing lantus.",

"well i had a cheat day speaking of which, do you guys just eat the whole shop without bolusing?",
kinda did so today and my sugar spiked from 7.2 to 16.4.,
naughty me,
i have been reading up on protein and what the guide lines are for the amount we should eat on low carb.,
it says 100 gems or 3.,
"1/2 ounces, that seems very little.",
i love my food and need to keep kidneys healthy.,
so should i use these guidelines as i thought having no carbs one could eat what you want.,
i am on pure lemon juice in water as soon as i get up and i can say it has curbed my desire for sweet food.,
is it possible to buy a plate that has sections for protein veg and starch i think there used to be one think i need this plate friends.,
but isnt meat all protein.,
oh dear does that means that i have to know the protein of everything i eat and i can only have 100gms a day .,
i thought protein was meat poultry fish any of that was protein gee i am doing it all wrong hmm ok thank you for this i am going to look into it further.,
xxx thank you for this so grateful for all your help yes i do have chronic kidney disease stage 3 my kidneys are only work at 33 percent.,

"told to give up salt which i have and although dictor says they are holding their own as he put it, i am trying to get things right in what i am eating to help them keep steady.",

hello.,
i think i have ask ask about this problem before but now it's much worst.,
"i used to fall asleep after eating anything with sugar after about half an hour, now i am dropping off to sleep after eating anything and almost straight away.",
i just did it to day had some cottage cheese and ham and when i finished just went to sleep it's like almost passing out i was sitting up looking on my pc.,
it's horrible.,
was wondering if anyone has this problem or what is making me do this?,
my husband used to think it funny but now he doesn't it's worrying.,
also i have a slight headache when i come round like a bit of a hangover.,
i have one dr saying i'm prediabetic and another one at the hospital saying i'm not.,
yes but you feel good when you wake up i feel dreadful.,
are you prediabetic?,
how long have you done this?,
and is it after eating anything say cheese for instance no carbs?,
thank you very much for your reply.,
i do test my blood but only two hours after eating but next time i will test it when i feel sleepy and when i wake up good idea.,
i know wheat gluten and sugar do make it a lot worst never eat wheat or gluten if i can help it.,
sugar is a killer.,
well let you know how it goes.,
"hello all, i am after a bit of advice on an issue.",
if anyone can give me any information that would be great as i know nothing on this subject.,
i have just spoken to a doctors receptionist with regard to blood tests i had last week (no doctor available).,
what she has told me has given me concern.,
apparently i need to redo one of my tests and have a fasting blood test as the figure which i registered was 6.8.,
is 6.8 high?,
i had the blood test at 08:20 am just 30 minutes after eating two weetabix for breakfast.,
i also had a cup of coffee.,
no additional sugar was added to the weetabix or coffee.,
i am a 39 year old male who weighs 11st 10lbs.,

any advice or reassurance would be greatly appreciated.,
thank you.,
craig last week i had a 'fasting' blood test where the result came back as 5mmol/l.,
"as i put in my original email, i knew nothing about diabetes but having read about it in the last week or so i am beginning to realise what kind of ailment it is and how much time and effort people have to spend to maintain their health.",
many thanks for your answers.,
cheers craig,
"i looked to see if this was discussed before on this forum rather than starting a new thread, but seemed to get linked to threads about other illnesses.",
i think this is connected to diabetes though.,
sometimes after eating i get really hot.,
so hot it's like a fever and you can feel the heat radiating out of the top of my head!,
i get all red and my neck feels hot too.,
it happens quite soon after a meal and can last an hour or so.,
it doesn't always happen either.,
googling has landed me with some quite alarming diagnoses that have nothing to do with food but i'm certain it's related to meals because of the timing.,
"obvious next step is to ask the doctor, but wondered if it is something other people have experienced.",
i'm type 2 newly diagnosed on lchf for about a month.,
thankyou both!,
"hello catherine, that certainly sounds like it!",
i don't like the suggestion that it could be linked to kidney problems but it did mention cheese and vinegar as triggers (and i had both before the last episode).,
"jack, i've looked that up too and it's certainly a possibility.",
i'm very new to diabetes and trying to avoid going on medication but so much is trial and error at this stage!,
i'm keeping a diary of bg levels and food i eat.,
i think i'll add hot flushes to this and see if i notice a pattern!,
they have so far only taken my blood for bg tests.,
in fact i've yet to see a doctor.,
i was diagnosed and notified by a combination of the surgery receptionist and a nurse.,
"i'm due back for the three month tests, and i'll go armed with questions!",
thank you gemma.,
i had baked camembert (a whole one) with salad then not long after my head felt like a volcano!,
so it could be.,
"this is recent though, i didn't have this problem before.",
i love cheese so rather hoping this isn't it i don't either!,
but i will ask my doctor soon.,
i had a small amount of cheese at lunchtime and ended up with a hot flush about half an hour later.,
"but, i'm certain there was also vinegar in the salad so not very scientific!",
i may experiment with some cheddar in a moment...watch this space were you lol i love cheese.,
it didn't seem to be the cheese this time gemma.,
at least not cathedral city cheddar hope so!,
"hi, lchf is promoted on this forum and with excellent results but i was just wondering why does the fat content have to be high?",
"as a t2 i struggle to tolerate sugar and carbs so this is what needs to be addressed, not sure why i need to seek to increase fats over and above those naturally present in diet regime that reduces carbs?",
"thanks @brunneria , just thinking the seeking 'high fat' message isn't quite correct, it's more don't unduly worry about the fat content thanks @mbaker , i like the 'healthy' fat branding much better than 'high' fat very helpful thank you @there is no spoon .",
i think the 'high fat' does spook some people especially if they have associated cholesterol issues so 'healthy' fat woks for me i recall when new to diagnosis reading posts on here about bullet proof coffee and when i looked up the recipe i felt instantly sick!!!,
"healthy fat is a much gentler introduction for newbies guzzler said: i have bulletproof every morning, i love it but i had been diagnosed a year before i tried it because, like you, i was put off by the recipe and thought i might as well drink liquid lard!",
"but, like i say, i adore it.",
"basically, we have two sources of fuel for the body and they are fats and carbohydrates.",
if we cut down on one source of fuel it must be replaced by the other or we simply run out of fuel.,
"the fats can come from two sources, that which we have stored in our bodies and that which we eat.",
"it is logical to use excess fats stored in the body rather than to keep adding to those stored fats which just make us heavier and sicker but it is not dietary fats that add to our weight, it is the carbs that add to our stores and raise our bg to harmful levels.",
the 'high fat' part of lchf is only high when directly compared to the (very) low fat diet we have come to think of as normal over the last few decades.,
i have deliberately left out protein in this because protein has a far more important role in growth and repair and although it can be used as a fuel it is better suited to these purposes.,
"as to cholesterol, the human body manufacturers it, in fact all but a couple of types of cells in the body can make it and it is vital for life.",
dietary cholesterol (from animal fats) makes up at most 15% of total body cholesterol the other 85% is made by the body.,
we can absorb a few plant sterols in passing but these are so few it is hardly worth mentioning.,

hi all.,
"newly diagnosed t1d here, about a month ago, with a hba1c of 124 on diagnosis.",
clearly had been diabetic for months without realising.,
i have had most of the required health checks done to ensure i did not do any damage with such a high hba1c for god knows how long.,
the last think to check are my eyes.,
"i mentioned getting an appointment to my dsn yesterday and she said i could just arrange it with any of the local opticians boots, specsavers etc... is that accurate?",
i was under the impression it had to be organised through the nhs and done in specialised nhs locations?,
thanks for your help in advance!,
ian my experience has not been great so far.,
"was send to a&e by gp as had ketones in my urine and after a night on a drip and been shown how to use the insulin pens was discharged with basic info, they even tried to discharge me without my insulin as it was not ready and told me to pick it up the following day then i had to wait 5 weeks to see the dsn (been told it might be over 6 months to see the endocrinologist) and the meeting was not exactly useful so not too surprised she did not mention retinal screening until asked.",
i also enquired about dafne course but was told it would be 6 months before she would put me on the list as they wanted to be sure about the type of diabetes i have.,
this despite the fact i have never had a % body fat above 12% as i am an exercise nut and watch what i eat.,
also i was positive on the antibody test so pretty clearly type 1.,
"blood sugar levels are already under control at least, as i entered a honeymoon phase after a week on insulin, getting by on only a few units of basal and could probably get by without bolus at meals if i don't eat more than 30/40g of carbs.",
i realise this wont last forever though.,
i will talk to my gp he is usually pretty good so maybe he can refer me.,
"to all our highly researched and well controlled diabetics on the forum when advising diabetics, even if it is in answer to a post by an experienced diabetic, please remember that this forum is read by newly diagnosed as well.",
you may have got your numbers very low but for someone who is high then this is like shooting for the moon!,
the advice to get to the nice guidelines is do-able for most newly diagnosed.,
"once they get their levels down to that level, then they can try for the lower levels as, by this time, they will have got some idea on diet etc.",
and more experience in just what diabetes is.,
"similarly on diet, yes, you may have a diet that controls your diabetes successfully but did you start there?",
reducing down gradually is more likely to be permanent and a life style change than trying to go ultra- low immediately and perhaps failing and feeling guilty about it.,
"on testing, please remember when you were first diagnosed.",
newly diagnosed diabetics need to test frequently to find out what the food they are eating is doing to their blood sugar levels.this means testing before a meal and two hours after.,
"testing after three hours is advised if eating food with a heavy fat content is eaten because fat slows down the absorption rate of some foods.one hour testing, looking for spikes in blood sugar can be useful as well.",
newly diagnosed diabetics need time to acclimatise to their condition and small steps at a time are more likely to succeed than very large steps.,
similarly advising that certain low numbers are ok just because you have attained them is very disheartening for someone confused and inexperienced.,
being confused immediately after a diagnosis is very common.,
so i have an appointment coming up and i will be quizzed about my diet (low carb and working very well).,
what do you say when you are lectured about eating carbs and how important they are.,
im fed up smiling sweetly and agreeing.,
i keep getting told i need carbs yet doing just fine on 20g a day.,
"thanks x mr_pot said: apart from the eatwell guide that was part of a desmond type course, nobody has ever suggested eating carbs to me.",
my dn is a lc enthusiast but even so we have never discussed how much carbs i eat.,
don't hcps usually tell you to cut down on things or eat more fruit and veg?,
are you saying they are actually prescribing more carbs as a cure for something?,
click to expand...,
i am always shown the eatwell guide and shown the shopping list which includes pasta and bread!,
i always get a bit tongue tied and nervous for some reason and just nod and smile.,
im apparently a bit of a mystery to them but they dont seem to link my low carb eating to my low bg .,
in fact when i mentioned the challenges of eating out (cant remember why we were discussing that) i was told to eat the pasta but dont have dessert!,
resurgam said: my response to the 'you need carbs' comment has always been - 'really?,
what for?',
click to expand...,
"i was told it was for my brain... brunneria said: i have tried various approached over the years, but most recently i have avoided the term low carb and high fat, or any other trigger words that may set off an ignorant knee jerk reaction.",
"last time i used the words 'i control my carbs, which is what brought my blood glucose down to normal levels'.",
"and since they had just seen my perfectly normal hba1c they just let it go, and moved on to the next subject.",
either that or they didn't 'get' what i was talking about.,
"of course, if a medical professional wanted to discuss things in more depth, i would happily do so.",
probably in enough detail that they ran screaming from the room.,
"but until that happy day arrives, i can say 'i control my carbs' and they can hear 'she's eating carbs which is a good thing, cos of 50 reasons i repeat by rote which aren't actually valid', while what i actually mean is 'i control my carbs well enough that i have virtually eliminated them, and feel soooooo much better for it!'",

i really like that idea.,
thanks.,
"hi all, i've not posted for a little while, but i have a questions over the past 10 days i've been noticing something odd with my eyesight, in that i occasionally see yellow spots (not floaters), and at other times i've noticed in the far corners of my vision (what when i used to have hair) would have been hair beginning to encroach into my vision...",
but i have short hair nowadays so there is no hair to sweep away... any one else had this?,
"i had my 6 monthly diabetic appointment today, all spot on still hba1c 39 so still in control but when i mentioned my eyesight the nurse suggested i go see an optician, good advice, but i thought i'd check that out with the good folks here.",
"update: so i finally went to the optician (i almost didn't' as the yellow spot went away), we'll he threw all his toys and the kitchen sink out of the pram and told me to get to eye casualty in southampton hospital immediately!",
and he couldn't understand why the diabetic nurse hadn't given that advise!,
"i must say they were all very nice there at the hospital, it was an a&e unit, i took my ticket and waited my turn.",
"i got seen by a nurse and they took the same sort of pictures of my eye as the yearly diabetic screening one, however i got to see the results (as well as a picture, there was some computer coloured graphics) this showed that there was a difference between my eyes.",
long storey short there was indeed some damage to one of them.,
as a result almost 3 weeks on i have now received an appointment in 4 weeks time for a fundus flourescein angiography they told me that this test should identify the damage.,
"just asking has anyone had this test, what i really want to know if can i drive afterwards, not straight away but perhaps 2-3 hours later?",
and well what was the test like?,
"hi jasmindolly, yes that's exactly what i was seeing, i also thought that the pavement had been stained yellow and then realised that the yellow spot/sploge (large tennis ball sized) was following me around wherever i looked...",
if that is what you are seeing i would do what i did and just go to a hospital that has an eye a&e section (a local optician should know where the nearest one is to you) and let them take a look at you...,
"i did walk into an optician and describe what i was seeing first if that might help you decide, but eye a&e are the experts.",
"as i mentioned up above, it turns out that i do have some sort of damage (so just as well that i had taken this seriously and reported it) which is why they are doing further tests, although as an in patient and not an emergency, i was also noticing like the hem of a black curtain just out of my vision range on the edges of my eyesight, occasionally... hope that helps.",
"hi mohammad, if you've seen some specialists and they've passed you as ok, then nothing to worry about.",
"the eyes hospital that i went to as i mentioned found some damaged, just out of my visual range, which at night as my pupils open up a bit more, caused me to see whispers and occasional yellow spots...",
"they did something like an mri test of my eyes and i can see that they 2 eyes are different with one having a slight disturbance (round) looks like a blister in one eye, but the experts they said, luckily its right on the edge of my visual range and should it ever burst just to go back in to them.",
they weren't worried i'd go blind or anything.,
"so i'd say enjoy your holiday, protect your eyes( sunglasses etc.,) and if you want a 2nd opinion visit your local eye hospital and just say what you're seeing...",
they should be very thorough with their test.,
hope tht helps?,
"hi, i went to an eye hospital, that had an eye a&e, track down the nearest eye hospital with an eye a&e and go in telling them what you're seeing and they ougth to start doing test.",
"what mine was, is a blister in my eye, but just out of the field of vision.",
if a non-diabetic does a test after having fasted for 14 hours is a reading of 5.8mmol considered normal?,
i somehow had in my head that a fasting reading should be in the 4s for a non-diabetic.,
i've done two fasting tests in the last two weeks and both were 5.8 mmol.,
when jess was first diagnosed four years ago i did a test simply to see if it hurt so i'd understand what it was like for her and i remember that test being 4.something.,
"i've also tested myself once a couple of years ago because we thought there was a problem with her test meter, the reading then too was 4.something.",
when i did the test again a couple of weeks ago and got a reading of 5.8 i thought that was higher than it should be.,
i saw the nurse today for a general check up (i have to once a year for my repeat prescription) and my blood pressure has gone higher than it usually is (130/74 from 110/74) so she's sent me off to have some blood tests done.,
one of the things she's testing for is blood glucose.,
i didn't say anything to her about having done a couple of tests myself already.,
"i don't think i'm developing diabetes because i don't show any symptoms, perhaps it's a result of lower exercise levels (i used to be very active, now i'm only moderately active) and perhaps stress or lack of sleep.",
"i routinely test jess at between 1am and 2am 3 to 4 nights a week and sometimes more often if she's running on a low period, this i've been doing for the past 4 years so perhaps it's all catching up with me now.",
"i know stress affects blood glucose and blood pressure, does tiredness to the same?",
"hi, a friend of mine was diagnosed type 2 a few months back.",
"he has a tingling in his toes, but no blackening or outwards signs of neuropathy.",
"he now has very well managed bgs, but on diagnosis he was high with an hba1c of 11.2 so it could be he had early neuropathy at that stage.",
"the question is, now he's down to very good levels, if it was early neuropathy, is it likely to fix itself?",
anyone have experience/knowledge of this?,
"thanks for that lovinglife, i'll pass it on.",
"thanks all, useful info",
"hi ppl, i have a problem which i hope someone could shed some light on.",
"yesterday before breakfast bg's was 7.3 , then i had 2 weetabix with semi-skimmed milk and a glass of water.",
when i took my bloods five and a half hours l ater my bg's was 8.7!,
"i would have thought that weetabix, plain with no sugar, sweetener/ honey / fruit would have given me good results, obviously not.",
"and, given the length of time between eating & my next test i would have thought it would have been certainly lower then 8.7.",
i'm diet controlled only.,
any suggestions gratefully received.,
"thank you in advance wow, lots of info ppl, great, thanks.",
"so my options are don't go near cereals or try just 1 weetabix & i love cinnamon and vanilla, hmmm.",
i think i'll try that.,
"but, like you all said if my bg's are still high like that it'll be time to cut out the cereals from my life.",
boo hoo!,
"but if it's got to be done, so be it.",
i did contemplate a gi diet long before i was diagnosed & the reason i wanted to do it was because of the strong family history of diabetes.,
"but, like new years' resolutions it never got started & here i am.",
"i'm not on any diabetes meds & really hope i can control it myself, i take more than enough meds as it is.",
"i think i might have a gi diet book somewhere, when i find it i'll get started.",
thanks everyone for your advice karynn jackie is exactly right.,
even before my dx of diabetes food was a minefield.,
"all foods that are good, nutritious my body doesn't like & i suffer for it.",
"can't do bran, vegetables - not a good effect, certain fruits are a definate no go area!",
"because everyone says that a lot of people that are overweight skip breakfast, i always eat a 'good' breakfast, or so i thought.",
karynn yes i can do scambled egg.,
"the funny thing is, i've only ever learned how to make it in the microwave.",
i used to make it for my mum.,
"i'll give it a go, it's been years since i've made it.",
thanks for the suggestion,

i am confused between flaxseed and linseed.,
i having been buying pre ground/milled flaxseed from a health shop (h&b) for 4.99 for 425grms.,
"but have been told that golden linseed (which is a whole seed) is the same stuff, but you have to grind it yourself in a coffee grinder and it becomes flaxseed is this true.???",
as i have checked the carb content of ground/ milled flax per 100gram = 1.7grams golden linseed per 100gram = 34.25grams is this correct or am i missing something here???,
"as if golden linseed has that many carbs in it, i shall be staying well away and stick to the ground/milled flax instead.",
"any ideas, cheers simply_h any ideas on the above.",
"hello, thank you whitbyjet.",
cheers simply_h,
for a gift i received a homedics foot massager and wanted to know if these had an adverse effect on diabetics?,
"i appreciate that diabetics need to look after their feet and nerve damage can occur etc but i would of thought that an electronic foor massager would help with circulation and aid good care!....it does say in the instructions ""not recommended for use by diabetis"" however this could be protecting the manufacturers interest rather than be medical ly proven does anyone know the effects that the massager would have....i would assume that it will increase circulation so will have a positive effect or on the flip side im not sure if it could possible cause nerve damage??",
thanks for your advice and experiances.,
as 'smidge' noted i also think people over generailise about diabetes and possible complications and providing we keep a good balance this reduces the chances.,
i have seen no-where suggesting that foot massagers (and the sensastion of) can contribute towards nerve damage and considering my general good health i think i will continue to use mine in accordance with recommendations.,

"i'm trying to find mixers, especially lemonade and tonic water, and other soft drinks that have no aspartame, and it's not easy, they all seem to use the stuff!",

it is very difficult to find alternatives but i found that 'sainsbury's' cheap own brand lemonade doesn't use aspartame but instead uses 'sucralose' which is considered as safe.,

diagnosed 2014.,
been measuring since then.,
"this year a number of times, i try to measure bg as normal, but when i prick my finger and place drop on strip, my blood is so thick it doesnt even travel on the stick to the reader to get a reading!",
this is really worrying me.,
ive wasted quite a few strips as well but obviously am more concerned by what this must be doing to me.,
"ie thick blood cant be good for me inside.i have tried drinking loads during the day ( to the point am constantly going to the loo, and pee is clear ....so not dehydrated) when i finally get a reading, ( repeating a few times) its generally around 6.5.",
"not perfect , but not hideous?",
has anyone else had this?,
any idea as to causes?,
( other than the well youve got diabetes...)???,
thanks hi antje- yeah sorry i wasnt describing it well: thats what happens normally- blood touches end of stick and it sucks it up.,
but when i have this thick blood it kind of just sits there on top and isnt sucked up so i assume its too thick to do so.,
hi guzzler- thanks but i dont think its technique as ive been measuring for 4 years no problem.,
it happens occasionally and the blood does seem thicker than normal.,
ill definitely revisit the technique to check.,
i am worried about thicker blood though and wondered if anyone has experienced it?,
"especially as reading around the subject (although limited info) suggests link to heart attacks guzzler said: i would be tempted to mention it to the gp in your shoes, if only to put my mind at rest.",

i am recently diagnosed type 2 and my doctor has prescribed me metformin.,
i read the leaflet and it says not to have alcohol while on this medication.,
as i expect to be on this for life this means no more alcohol.,
ever again.,
:thumbdown: i don't drink much.,
my wife and i have perhaps one (small) glass of wine per week.,
but we really enjoy it.,
does anyone have experience of this?,
should i really stop drinking completely now i'm on metformin?,
"the leaflet says ""alcohol may increase the risk of lactic acidosis especially if you have liver problems or if you are undernourished.""",
i do not have liver problems and am not undernourished.,
thank you for any guidance you can provide!,
thank you!,
so good to hear.,
you never know with these leaflets how much of it is them trying to cover themselves.,
i am starting on 500mg and then moving to 3 x 500mg a day.,
i will watch out in case there are any problems with my moderate drinking.,
i'm glad that diabetes won't take this pleasure away!,
thank you.,
thanks everyone.,
you've put my mind at rest.,
and i love the way some turned it into a discussion about where to find the cheapest wine.,
cheered me up no end thank you!,
"hi there, i have entered the daunting world of purchasing a property!",
as part of the conditions of getting a mortgage i have to get life insurance.,
"as expected, being a diabetic i've been quoted a higher premium some mark up 200% on the initial quote sometimes 150% depends on the company.",
i've been getting quotes by trying different comparison sites plus my union with the same quotes.,
what i want to know is the insurance brokers that claim they specialise in dealing with pre-existing medical conditions do they really get better quotes?,
what are other people's experiences.,
perhaps i need to accept that it will be considerably more because i am a higher risk.,
thank you both for your advice.,
yes i have decided to look around.,
"i've currently got 2 specialist ones looking for me, and i might give aplan a try as well.",
i've never heard of them so thanks for mentioning them.,
fingers crossed i get something better.,
"having put a quote request in at aplan, i just got a call from 'family services' who are the insurance brokers for compare the market, who have just advised me that they also part of aplan!",
so very confusing!,
the chap advised me that the original quote would be the best one despite me shopping around!,
- they all say that!,
sorry to hear that.,
so far i've got past the initial stage and have been told there shouldn't be a problem.,
just got to wait to hear back about the doctors report that one insurance company requires.,
"hiya, i'm really grateful you said that.",
i just checked the 'personalised illustration' and it only mentions building insurance!!,
thanks for that.,
"however, i will get it anyway as like you say it's good to have and i have a family and i'm the main earner.",
it means now that i don't have to be in a major hurry to get it!,
wow it's soon hard not to get shafted when it comes to property!!,
thank you.,
i was told by one broker better to have it below 7.,
thankfully mine was 6.7 the last time.,
thanks ali.,
"yes they are naughty, so grateful for these forums!",
waiting on several quotes now so hopefully one will be better.,
will let you know how i get on with the quotes.,
"so far ive got 37 a month for joint cover from a standard comparison site, and same through my unions service.",
the insurance surgery which i was referred to from this site believes they can get me 29 - 34 but won't know until i have done the questionnaire and then confirm with the insurance company.,
so far they seem to be more detailed with the questions.,
as mentioned before it helps to have a good hba1c and its worth shopping around.,
"you will get sick of answering questions, and with the specialist ones you won't get an instant quote, but think they might get the better quote so worth it.",
will keep you posted.,
yes sure no probs.,
"it was for 190,000 decreasing so goes down with the mortgage repayments which makes it cheaper.",
it's for joint cover so it would be for my partner and i.,
age does come into it as we'll i'm 34 and partner 38 so will be slightly higher so the younger you get it the better as it stays the same for the term of your mortgage.,
you probably know this but thought i would mentioned for people just looking into it.,
my most recent hb the one i gave them is 6.7 sw11bloke - 23 is really good do you mind me asking how old you are?,
how long ago did you get that?,
i know the advice is to test at 2hrs or 1hr after starting a meal.,
however i just did a test after 30 mins and got a much bigger reading.,
is this what you would expect ?,
i thought the idea of testing at 1hr was to catch the peak reading (ie after giving the food time to get into the blood).,
or is the 1hr measurement supposed to be checking that the level has come down quickly enough ?,
just to clarify.,
i'm barely prediabetic but have neuropathy.,
trying to get my blood glucose to be normal by dr bernstein standards.,
i've read on another thread that you should keep even the spikes below 7.7.,
just wondering if the spikes are occurring before i take the 1hr post prandial reading so i'm missing them.,
thank you all for your posts.,
i'm very new to this and experimenting to see what different foods do.,
i have neuropathy and after reading various threads on here i am on lchf and trying to get my blood sugar down to normal levels (as per dr bernstein).,
trying to get my blood sugar down to normal levels with v low spikes i've been on it for about 5 weeks and am generally going in the right direction.,
this morning i had almond porridge with just a tablespoon of oats.,
my bag went from 5.6 up to 7.8 guess the oats maybe don't suit me.,
thanks again for all your advice.,
i am tracking my progress and neuropathy symptoms quite closely and will post results in a few weeks.,
(i have also seen neurologist and will go back to gp if the lchf and supplements don't work) thanks for your input.,
i took the advice to experiment without the oats.,
so my breakfast was: 50g of ground almonds cooked in water 1 tablespoon of greek style yoghurt 6 walnut halves large cup of coffee with single cream this is same as yesterday but omitted the tablespoon of jumbo oats bg reading went from 6.2 up to 6.3 after 30 mins !!,
so maybe its the oats that cause me a problem.,
will check again though as not wholly convinced and also the porridge is nowhere near as yummy without them.,

"hey everyone, i have a few questions about units of insulin.",
i've only just started caring about my diabetes after 10 years.,
"i'm 19 and have suffered from depression since the age of approx' 11/12 (though am happy to say that i've turned over a new leaf and am finally coming out of it), so just blocked everything out and ignored all the information given to me, etc.",
i want to get my diabetes under control and have finally decided that coming to a forum with other diabetics can help me.,
i decided to start by asking this: i am on novo rapid fast-acting insulin and lantus long-acting insulin.,
i was wondering if anybody could give me advice on how many units of insulin i should be doing in relation to my blood glucose reading?,
"for example: how many units of novo rapid should i do if my blood sugar is... 9.0, 10.0, 11.0... etc, all the way up to being in the 30s 40s (which happens a lot due to my lack of control).",
is there a formula i could work with?,
like x amount of insulin units for x amount of 1.0s (cant think of a better name..) you want to reduce your sugars by?,
(for example: 1 unit of insulin to reduce my blood sugar by 1.5... or so on).,
also: is there a set amount of insulin to take after meals?,
"for example: if i had a normal sized plate of chips and pizza for dinner (though i don't usually, i'm quite a healthy veggie teenager!",
ha-ha!),
then is there an amount of insulin i should be taking?,
is there a dose of insulin that would cover me for all normal-sized meals?,
"and would this just be halved/quatered in relation to snacks, etc?",
or am i going to have to start counting fat and carbohydrates etc in order to calculate every insulin dose?,
(see?,
i really have no idea! ),
"i've been working with blind knowledge for so long, i have no idea how much insulin to do in relation to my readings.",
"i've always just guessed, and it's never helped as i've never had constant, normal readings - they're almost always high or low.",
"i'm trying to start taking care of myself, and feel like i need this information to get started.",
any help would be appreciated!,
"thanks a lot everybody, robyn x",
i wonder if anyone could tell me if they have had a similar reaction.,
i was diagnosed in june and my hb1ac was 8.5.,
got it down with diet weight loss and exercise alone to 7.2 in october.,
"however, i hadn'd been feeling so great for the last month or so and some of my symptoms pre diagnosis were creeping back.",
so i went back to the practice nurse last week and had some more tests done.,
"my urine sample was loaded with sugar, my fasting bg in the surgery that morning was 14 and my test results came back with an hb1ac that had risen to 7.5.",
i started metformin 500mg with my evening meal on thursday.,
that's to increase to 500mg three times a day over the next three weeks.,
i've fely a bit icky but nothing serious - except a stonking headache i can't shift even with paracetamol.,
everything i've read on the patient leaflet with the medicine and on here suggests that could be a side effect.,
it's hideous and i am not looking forward to getting through a working week with a headache like this.,
has anyone had a similar experience and how long might it last?,
i fear it may get worse as i up the doseage.,
thanks thanks for your reply dave.,
i too wondered if i could be a bit dehydrated so upped my fluid intake but the headache persists.,
i'm just hoping it's a side effect that'll fade soon cos it's quite literally doing my head in!!!,
thanks catherine.,
my bp and cholesterol levels are normal so i'm not on any medication other than metformin and the headache only arrived after i started taking it.,
i'll give it another day and see if it lifts if not i'll ask for a change of medication.,
thanks again for your advice.,
"hi folks, my headache reduced to a dull roar and the gippy tummy is no worse so i decided to stck with the metformin.",
"my bg readings are great, lots of 6.8 readings 2 hours after food, and compared with how they have been i'm delighted.",
"but, there always seems to be a but..... the headache has returned with a vengeance along with back pain, cold type symptoms and todays development is an itchy rash.",
i had to come home from work at lunch time because i feel so awful.,
in some ways i wish i hadn't beacuse i just can't get warm at home.,
that's the trouble with heating on the timer - i'm freezing!,
i called the surgery to speak to the diabetic nurse but as she was out on calls spoke to a gp instead.,
"he's concerned about these symptoms, asked me to stop the metformin and come in and see him tomorrow.",
i do feel pretty rubbish but kind of expected to given others experiences in adjusting to the metformin.,
i wonder if i may have an allergy to it but will wait see what the gp says tomorrow.,
wondered if anyone else had similar problems?,
"thanks hi there, thanks for replying.",
i'm due to see the gp at 3.30 so i'll post again later today.,
my headache isn't as bad this morning and the rash has subsided so hopefully when the metformin has fully worked out from my system i'll feel better.,
"hi there, hana, you may well be right.",
my gp gave me a good check over today.,
it's possible that i may have an infection and he thinks working out what's wrong will be a process of elimination.,
"i've to remain off the metformin to see if symptoms clear up on their own, meanwhile he's suggested i may have an infection in my sinus - that may expalin the headache - and wants to rule out a uti - that may explain the lower back pain.",
"however, it could also be side effects or an allergy to the metformin.",
until the metformin works its way out my system and the test results are back i'll need to keep it till it's better.,
i might still feel rubbish but hats off to my gp who made time to see me today.,
i go back next week and take it from there.,
me too.,
thanks synonym,
hi guys.,
i had a bit of a weird episode today and ended up in hospital.,
annoying as i'd made extra effort to get to my lecture on time and i have to travel over an hour to university!,
when i got home there was still this metallic taste in my mouth that i assumed would go away.,
i had heard people describe such a taste but i was unsure of what it would be like until i began experiencing it myself.,
i was wondering if it had anything to do with my blood sugar (ruled out pregnancy and stuff after a urine test and bloods etc) as my readings were between 3 and 10 today.,
"(they gave me a ham sandwich and my level immediately dropped @_@) thanks for any answers, guys.",
"hi, sorry i should have clarified, after a forum search i saw everyone discussing the metallic taste had just started taking metformin.",
i am not on medication because it seems every pill under the sun i have a bad reaction to and i don't have an official diagnosis.,
i'm diagnosed pcos but i'm 'too skinny' for t2 to be a real concern.,
just been told to keep an eye on my level and have been doing so with my grandma who is type 2 like the rest of my family.,
"half my hospital stays are extended by the treatment causing me to vomit violently 0_o andy, can you elaborate?",
did you get this taste whilst not on metformin then?,
"what's going on, here?",
thanks a bunch again x thanks andy.,
i've been avoiding the doctor's office lately.,
perhaps i should just suck it up and go with a list of all my symptoms.,
maybe if i get a firm diagnosis and one of those exemption cards i won't have to pay so much for prescriptions and test strips.,
"i hate annoying them with my list and only having 10 minutes to go through it al, then i'm on the waiting list to see someone after like 6 months and that expert shrugs their shoulders and says 'i don't know why the hell you are exhibiting this symptom'.",
got to look at the picture as a whole i suppose.,
i wonder if the taste is a common warning sign in pre/borderline diabetics.,
"do your sugar levels fluctuate alot, too andy?",
mine are usually around 7-10.3 and after a big meal it can drop to 3 so both ends of the spectrum.,
i wonder if the taste is to do with that change rather than hypo or hyperglycemia particularly.,
when someone starts taking metformin and their blood sugar levels drop to a normal level this is the result???,
thanks for trying to help out.,
i posted another rant earlier today -_- i hit 15.4 today and i am assuming or the most part i'm resistant to whatever mr pancreas is pumping out and then a couple carbs too many and it has a hissy fit making me go super low??,
"i mean my fasting levels are a bit on the high side upper 5s,6s but not crazy high like an actual diabetic.",
whatever's going on i don't like being low or high much.,
i also don't like the funny tastes or other weird symptoms.,
i hate being blown off by the doctor too.,
do you know how many times i tried to kill myself/had panic attacks when i was younger and no one would treat me for depression?,
now i'm not suicidal (stomach can't handle pills anyway) and i tell/show the doctor about physical symptoms and she just says 'i think you're depressed' and totally shuts off typing away at the computer.,
ffs...,
i'll try again and get back to you if she actually requests any bloods or at least gives me something better for all these rashes and things...,
sent from the diabetes forum app thanks for your input..,
even though i am moaning and yelling so much :/ hi by the way :3 i'm pretty confused.,
numbers and going up and up... gp refuses to do a gtt.,
don't know what to do but rant on the internet about how ****** i feel eating/not eating recovering from an eating disorder >_> if its prediabetes and i got i diagnosis i could have some help and be able to fix some of those problems relatively quick.,
also it'd be nice to have an explanation when people ask 'why do you get sick all the time?,
why is there always something wrong with you?,
why can you eat this?',
doctor didn't care huh?,
seems to be a trend.,
i only know two gps who genuinely care about me.,
one is a gyno and is looking at my chronic pelvic pain (i'm worrying this is a type of neuropathy :/) and the other is sadly always too booked up to see me.,
i'm so sorry i've done nothing but spam the boards about my frustration...,
i will give something back.,
i will make myself useful here one of these days...,
sent from the diabetes forum app the metallic taste thing seems to come and go for days at a time and the last time i remember was after a hypo i think ...,
"but yes, recently numbers are going up, though i've had recurring thrush down there and white patches in my mouth for years, horrible skin infections where under my arms were just open wounds, tinea versicolor and some 'unknown' infection on my scalp and in my nose from 13yrs old to now at 20.",
the metallic taste thing has only been recent though.,
maybe i should go buy canisten or something otc but don't know how long that will last...,
"the taste is bothering me less that the skin conditions tbh, but i thought it strange.",
i'd heard of people describing such a taste but couldn't picture it until i was experiencing it myself.,
continuing the regime of antifungal shampoo.,
thanks for the response x whether or not it's causing the taste i should be figuring out how to stop the fungal infections anyway.,

apart from artificial sweeteners - has anyone researched this product and perhaps other 'zero' drinks please?,
thank you catherine and noblehead - midnight here so i will research the link so kindly provided and the ingredient phenylalanine tomorrow.,

pepsi max is sugar free.,

what you doin' with my cat's picture ???,
that's not angus it's scuffy my cat!!,
scruffy is identical to yours.,
he and his brother were feral here and i tamed him to become a housecat.,
would have had his brother but he disappeared most cats die here before they are 5 months old due to a wicked virus mainly carried by the kittens' mother which means all litters die so i am lucky to have him he is about 2 years old also.,
so i have now had diabetes for 7 weeks.,
after reading lots of posts i have been trying to reduce the amount of carbs that i eat - most days now it's probably between 60 -100g per day.,
"for the first few weeks i didn't feel great and didn't want to go out anyway, and since then have been to a couple of bbq's.",
now i would like to get my life back - just without the carbs in it!,
i have taken my daughter to nandos - that was fairly easy as the menu is published and there are good choices you can make.,
tomorrow i am going out to my favourite indian restaurant - but i don't knwo what to eat.,
is there any good choices?,
"i would really like to have a poppadom although i can probably do without rice, but what would be a good - or if not good least bad choice of main course to make?",
oh good.,
this is much better than i thought!,
"they do do both a spinach and a fenugreek dish but think i will try my favourite which is a punjabi dish with mushrooms, onions and peppers.",
we don't normally have starters so will try my poppadom with spicy onions and a little rice and have a couple of glasses of red wine and see what effect this has.,
"i can always try something else next time well i had a poppodum, some spiced onions, half a dish of rice and my curry and a couple of glasses of wine and my bgl was 5.8 after 2 hours.",
delighted!,

also knowledge of what strains work best for your body and symptoms is really important.,
most recreational users and those where it's not legal often haven't a clue what they're smoking/vaping/eating :/ sent from the diabetes forum app click to expand...,
it actually works the same for me.,
it helps a lot with my frequent bouts of nausea and vomiting.,
works every time.,
i always throw up (not that i'm bulemic) so everything i eat (especially in the morning) usually gets flushed.,
that's why i'm a little underweight for my height.,
"pot improves my appetite, but i still watch what i eat.",
"i guess as long as we're careful with the use and not overdo it, it's totally fine.",
i have blurred vision today since waking up (a few hours ago).,
"i am trying to tell myself to stay calm, it will go away etc, but to be honest, i am freaking out.",
if i call a doctor i am willing to bet they will just say wait and see.,
the first thing they ask when i have a new symptom is - have you started taking any new medications?,
"and i have, i started olanzapine (for depression) a few weeks ago.",
i stopped it yesterday and went back to a different med because of the crazy side effects.,
olanzapine can cause blurred vision.,
but then so can a lot of things.,
i just can't be bothered dealing with doctors today unless there is something they can actually do for me.,
so i wanted to vent here instead.,
thanks for listening.,
thanks for the replies.,
"yes i have a meter and have been testing - the numbers are fine at the moment, thankfully.",
i'm also really watching the carbs at the moment just to be extra careful.,
the blurring improved over the day but is still an issue.,
"it's sunday so, on monday i will make an appointment to see my optometrist.",
i think he will know more about this than my gp.,
i think computer use has got something to do with it.,
looking at a screen for hours on end is a strain on the eyes.,
"if my eyes are not at their optimum health due to sugar levels, then straining them with the computer isn't a good idea.",
"in my experience, optometrists know a lot about this stuff.",
i saw my optometrist today.,
"good news is that the blurring has mostly gone away for now, and on testing nothing stands out that might cause alarm at the moment.",
"bad news is that its still a mystery what caused it and until we know that, we worry that it could come back.",
so i'm having a second eye assessment done to look at some possible eyesight issues that aren't diabetes related.,
i will also write down all my meds etc and they will see if it could have been the med changes.,
"one possibility is psychological stress causing vision changes, which you know, it just might be.",
"i'm a firm believer that if you have enough stress for enough years, it starts showing in your physical health in all sorts of ways.",
diabetes may well be connected to stress imho - in that managing stress as best you can is part of optimal diabetes management.,
it's an illness that is more than just sugar levels.,

"hi, i was diagnosed a couple of years ago.",
i recently moved to an area of the country where there seems to be little to no help for diabetic patients.,
my gp just passes me over to the practice nurse who tells me to test more each day and inject more insulin.,
"i have tried everything and my blood glucose levels are still really high, this morning my levels were 31mmol.",
"i have been struggling for breath for a while now too, heart palpitations and severe anxiety.",
it feels lke i can't get a satisfying breath of air into my lungs.,
"i'm only 31 and not overweight or anything, bmi of 21.",
could my shortness of breath be caused by my high levels?,
"has anyone else experienced difficulty breathing, or at least the sensation of finding it difficult to catch a breath.",
"i was a smoker for about 12 years and quit recently, perhaps it could be my lungs clearing up?",
i got an emergency appointment and saw a doctor and she said to just increase my lantus and see what happens.,
she laughed when i told her i felt i could not catch my breath and that i felt anxious and blew it off as being my imagination.,
iv'e been poked and prodded my entire life it seems.,
"i have had cancer twice and two bouts of acute pancriatitis whch lead to my diabetes, or so the doctor thought.",
i'm currently on novorapid and lantus.,
i must confess that i sometimes forget to take my novorapid when i eat a main meal and am not the best at testing.,
i'm on 34mg of lantus before bed so i guess that's not enough?,
yea i have tested fir keytones and all good on that front.,
how long does novorapid work for?,
i know it's fast acting but does it work for 4 hours?,
is that why you suggest not eating anything between then and testing before bed?,
interesting that my levels are at 13mmol at the moment and i am finding it easier to breath.,
what i don't understand is this.,
"say for example you have novorapid with dinner and 4 hours later you test just before bed and your levels are in the optimum range, say 6-7mmol, surely then taking lantus (background insulin) would cause you to have a hypo during the night?",
"i can't think of a worse tme to have a hypo, when your asleep, you might not wake up.. :shock: i just don't understand why we need background insulin if novorapid or another fast acting insulin brings the levels down to where they need to be anyway.",
is it best to go to bed with slightly high levels to avoid a hypo?,
or is lantus just very slow acting?,
so confused..,
"thanks sam, i don't think i inject enough novorapid, i never know how much to do, how much does 1 unit lower your blood glucose by?",
"if i had blood glucose of 15mmol before eating, how much would i need to inject?",
"i know the more carbs a meal has the more i need to inject, but how do you figure that out?",
"also, just spoke to a gp and i'm getting a chest x-ray done next week.",
"it was never really explained to me by anyone, i have some leaflets but they are a bit vague..",
"hello everyone, i am brand new to the forum and i hope it's ok to ask for some advice.",
"i was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 14 months ago, i am diet controlled and i have been doing ok until the last 5 weeks or so.",
"my ha counts have been 7 7.1 and the last one two months ago was 7.9, the diabetic nurse put the increase down to me getting married in may and putting 2lb in weight on ?!",
"i was told to not test my blood sugar levels and to carry on with the diet i was following, which is basically eating healthier and cutting out biscuits/crisps/cakes and chocolate all the best things !!",
"however over the last 5 weeks i have been feeling quite poorly, very thirsty, weeing an awful lot over 45 times a day and gallons of it .....",
"i feel very tired, nauseous, breathless, muscle cramping and confused and really out of sorts.",
"i thought due to the fact i was thirsty etc it would be a good idea to check my bs levels and they seemed to be a little high, morning waking was 15.5 and they were going up to 23.4, i went to the doctors and i tested positive for glucose/protein something else, possible infection but no ketones ?",
"i had a course of antibiotics and while i am not weeing quite so much i still feel awful, my morning levels have been 17/19.5 and i have just checked my levels an hour after my breakfast and they are 27.4 the gp didn't seem that interested in my sugar levels and hasn't suggested following it up, should i be worried ?",
"thanks for any advice tahdah hi all thanks for your replies, i have tried to get an appointment at the doctors but i can't be seen until wednesday night and to see the diabetic nurse there is a 4 week wait.",
"i don't think the care has been very good, when they diagnosed me all they did was give me a diet sheet and said don't eat anything listed in the right hand column and off you go, when i do see the nurse which has been twice she sits and looks at me as though i am an alien and i never know what to say.",
"my diet is ok, i don't eat alot of fatty foods and my cholesterol is very low, i also have sjorgren's syndrome which also causes a dry mouth so i am struggling at the moment.",
should i demand that the doctor does something about the levels ?,
how long do they have to be 27+ before i am taken seriously ?,
"thanks again hi everyone, i thought i would come back and update you all on my blood levels.",
"i went to see my doctor, showed him the monitor with levels on and he told me i needed to start medication, so he started me on 80mg of gliclazide, then i went to see the dr who specialises in diabetes and he added in 2 x 500mg of slow release metformin.",
"my levels have gone down, but are still between 11.5 and 15 first thing in the morning and between 14 and 18 during the day, have had a few 12.9 readings.",
"i am still unsure what is going on, should my levels have dropped lower now i have been on medication for over two weeks ?",
"i have to see the diabetic nurse tomorrow and i don't know what to say to her, she is the one who said my readings were high because i got married !!",
"i still feel ill, constant headache and extremely tired and so horrendously forgetful.",
any suggestions on what questions i should be asking her or demanding she do would be most appreciated.,
thanks tahdah hi thanks for the replies.,
"yes i am using a meter, they have got me testing 7 times a day at the moment.",
they have been fine about prescribing me boxes of test strips.,
"i will have a go at cutting carbs out totally and see what happens then, but i am not eating tons of carbs, i don't have fizzy drinks or anything like that.",
this morning i had two slices of granary toast with an olive oil based spread on it and a cup of tea.,
"i took 80mg of gliclazide and 500mg of metformin and my level two hours after was 16.1 other than cutting all carbs out and do an atkins style diet for a while i haven't got a clue what to do, though if i am not having any carbs and taking pills will that make the levels go too low ?",
"i am sorry i am probably sounding dumb, the diet advice i got from the nurse was a sheet of paper with eat things in this column and nothing in this one !",
"i just feel really fed up with it all now thanks for all the wonderful advice everybody, it's much appreciated.",
"i saw the nurse and she was much more helpful than previously, i have had my meds increased to 3 x 500mg of metformin and 2 x 80mg gliclazide to see what effect that has.",
she said normally they would increase meds gradually over months but given the high readings she is going to increase over weeks depending on the results.,
"she also mentioned byetta, though she also said that if my readings stay as high they may skip that and go straight onto insulin she is also going to call me twice a week over next few weeks to see how i am getting on and to take note of the readings, so a big improvement in care from previous few weeks.",
can i ask if anyone gets a sharp nagging pain under the middle/ left side of their tummy under their ribs ?,
is this caused by the meds ?,
thanks again hi all i just wanted to come back and say thanks for all the excellent advice and to update you on all the awful goings on i have had in last few weeks.,
"i have been rather ill, it seems i am allergic to metformin, i came out in an awful rash, sores in my mouth and just feeling absolutely awful, it's taken two weeks to start feeling slightly more human.",
"it also seems i have chronic pancreatitis for my sins, i am off for a scan tonight to assess the damage and to see whats going on.",
"my doctor and the diabetic specialist believe i have something called lada, which is what they said is like a type 1.5 diabetes, least thats how the explained it to me.",
"i can't tolerate the the diabetic tablets and to be honest even on 2 x 80 gliclazide and 1500 mg of met my levels were still in the high teens, so i have been to see the specialists today and i am starting insulin, not quite sure how i feel about that tbh, it all seems to have happened really quickly and i haven't got my head around it.",
"i am having a mix of fast acting and long lasting insulin twice a day, via a pen.",
"i am not sure what it means, does having to start insulin relatively early in life mean i will suffer complications in the future or does getting control (hopefully !)",
earlier mean i would be less likely to suffer complications ?,
"i am 40 by the way, which is apparently the new 30 or so i'm told !!",
many thanks tahdah,
anyone else find that their blood sugar can rise without having anything to eat or drink in the morning ?,
"if on waking up my blood sugar is say 5.5, if i don't have anything to eat or drink and check it again maybe about an hour later it will more often than not have shot up to about 12.0 or 15.0.",
this has always been the case and not just started happening lately.,
i'm type 1 and have been for almost 7 years.,
my diabetic nurse doesn't seem to have any idea either.,
"thanks thanks jo, that makes sense.",
i find it difficult to eat anything until at least an hour after waking up.,
i know i should and i'm going to start trying(soon anyway).,
and concerning the diabetes nurse chris.,
"the last 4 or 5 times i've been to see one, it's been at my local doctors, and i think they are just normal(general) nurses, not specialists on diabetes.",
so i think i'll go and see an actual diabetes nurse at the local hospital next time.,
thanks,
"hi, im type 2 diabetic on tablets.",
generally my readings are quite good.,
however last thursday i was given a cortisone injection into my arthritic knee.,

"i have been told that i need a root canal procedure pretty quickly to save my tooth (#14, upper left, second molar in) but there is no way i can afford one.",
"it's looking more and more every day like i have no other option than to have the tooth extracted, which i wouldn't have to pay for.",
i have always heard horror stories about that leading to massive infections and did some research.,
what i'm finding is that if diabetes is uncontrolled (a1c way over 7.0) then it becomes a concern.,
if it is well-controlled - as mine seems to be (a1c 6.4) - then it's not a huge problem and it should heal pretty quickly.,
"of course, these are things i'm reading on the internet, so there's always a chance they're inaccurate.",
"has anyone here ever experienced a tooth extraction while diabetic, and if so, how terrible or painful was it to have done?",
did you get infections from it?,
how did it affect your eating afterwards?,
how long did it take to heal?,
were you able to get an artificial replacement tooth?,
anything you can tell me about this will help a great deal.,
i'm really trying to steel my nerves for when this has to happen.,

hi everyone.,
i was diagnosed diabetic in december 2012 after years of being 'pre-diabetic'.,
the doctor started having me take metformin at 500mg twice a day.,
the usual gastro distress occurred and no biggie.,
but i started having horrible horrible lower back pain about a week after starting metformin.,
i told the doctors but i get no relief from them.,
they dismiss my pain.,
i've even done an experiment and stopped metformin for a couple days.,
"no surprise, the pain stopped!",
i went back on and pain so harsh i can barely walk.,
has anyone experienced a similar problem?,
"if so, what were you able to do to resolve the pain?",
were your doctors baffled like mine?,
"if they figured out the issue, what was it?",
thank you for your advice!,

"hi, i'm newly diagnosed type 2 and think it likely i'll be prescribed metformin.",
i also suffer from ibs.,

i'm slightly worried that i might be wedded to the loo - again!,
can anyone offer advice on how it may have affected them and how long any upset lasts?,
thanks thanks ken.,
i'll take a look through.,
ouch....trapped wind is sore.,
that's reassuring that it didn't cause the runs - that's what i fear the most.,
thanks for your reply totsy,
i've read something about the 1 hour test and that it can be damaging if high.,
this worried me as mine is sometimes as high as 10 or 11 mmol.,
but i always do a 2 hour test and it comes down to 7 ish.,
this is usually if i've had a carb filled meal so i don;t have that too often.,
but what is the guidlines for that 1 hour marker.,
thank you.,

it's not an exact science.,
grounded said: you are right - this whole issue surrounding bg levels is not an exact science and that is why there is so much confusion/ misinformation/speculation - take your pick.,
"what is normal, in any case?",
here's an example.,
a few days ago i persuaded my wife to eat the same as me for lunch and an afternoon 'treat'.,
"she is, as far as we know, 'normal'.",
"lunch was a cheese and tomato sandwich on seeded bread; the afternoon 'treat' was 2 smallish scones with rasberry jam and clotted cream (yes, i know, not very healthy but i say again, it was a 'treat').",
the bg results after 2 hrs: me (supposedly t2) 8.0; my wife (supposedly 'normal') 8.7.,
"this whole diabetic issue concerning hba1c values (at least in the type 2 world), what's good, what's bad' what's normal are all statistically derived - don't forget it and we all know about 'lies, damned lies and statistics'.",
click to expand... that's very interesting and enlightening.,
thanks i think for now i'll try to keep my 1 hr test results under 9.0 so as not to overload,
"hello, have lost my purse (argh stress), and one of the many things this contained was my card so i do not have to pay prescriptions.",
which the pharmacist often asks to see for some reason...,
does anyone know how i go about replacing this?,
am browsing the internet but have not easily found an answer - probably because i'm in a fluster.,
"sorry if this one puts you off your breakfast, but i have noticed on several occasions now that my urine smells really odd, rather like tcp.",
"it is not cloudy, and i don't get the usual uti symptoms, but i have been getting a lot of pain in my lower body and legs, like a dull ache that is constant.",
"i have spoken to my doc re the aching, as it seems different, and in addition to, the neuropathy i have been getting, and they took blood for tests, crp, rheumatoid, liver function, thyroid, but they didn't mention kidney function.",
"i forgot to mention the smell to him, and don't know if it's relevant.",
"also, i have only recently started on insulin, and have noticed that the insulin itself smells similar, so does anyone else have a similar problem?",
"or am i just turning into a hypochondriac/attention seeking whiner, as there always seems to be something else going wrong with my body recently?",
:roll:,
https://www.slimlinewine.com/,
does anyone know where your meant to get a replacement card from?,
cheers guys.,
"no it's not expired just missing, luckily the chemist rarely, if ever ask to see it.",
i keep reading that taking a statin can cause type 2 diabetes or at any rate they are a risk factor.,
if this is so then why are nice so keen to promote the things?,
or are they in league with big pharma?,
"can some one please tell me more about this, i've been told by my gp that i'm borderline and that i don't need medication.",
:?,
": hi all .. all that i know is that a fasting blood test, put my sugar levels at 7.1 .. which my doc told me was borderline and didn't or wouldn't require treatment..",

thanks everyone for your help ...,
"hi all,since being diagnosed with type 2 have given up cider and started drinking holstein pils,drinking this has been ok as my sugar levels have been alright.",

still trying to figure out if non diabetics get spikes after eating and how high they can get...,
i would assume anyone can get a spike if they eat too many carbs too quickly for their cells to be able to react to...,
"i have found people supporting both sides, but not much from the scientific community... would love to see continuous monitors on tons of people that have passed a morning and ogtt... but i found someone on another forum saying this about the subject... which really confuses me o_o it makes me think the person had a spike before the one hour mark and shot down before they were measured.",
"""sorry, a bit of thread hi-hacking i am a non-diabetic, bmi18-19, active female.",

"first, is this normal?",
"second, why do these foods cause these spikes when 75g of pure glucose causes no rise at all, after all banana is only around 20-30g of carb, 2 slices of toast about the same.""",
"i'm going to keep searching for something, anything showing what actually happens point for point after a ""normal"" person eats... whatever ""normal"" is... :/ http://www.myfitnesspal.com/topics/...-with-a-reading-of-234-half-hour-after-eating bottom of the page http://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2005/selvin-bloodsugar.html johns hopkins hospital talking about the effects of high blood sugar in diabetics and non-diabetics... why would they say that if ""normal"" people can't get spikes or go above the ""120"" normal...

http://www.diabetes-symposium.org/index.php?menu=view&source=authors&sourceid=49&id=322 that's exactly what i've been looking for =d thank you so much!,
i have been freaking out so much over what's been going on with me.,
with my breakfast and this data is looks like the steroids didn't mess with my cells or anything!,
... but i do believe now that both of my parents have diabetic genetics and will continue monitoring just in case.,
i won't worry so much though... and i've already learned to eat so much better!,
i really do apologize for having to make that post so quickly and not having the time to read your post before that.,
we had a bad storm that rolled in and i didn't know how long it was going to last and didn't want my computer on when a possible blackout could happen.,
"so then what are your levels 1 hour after eating say... 60-70g of carbs, say what i ate, 60g of cereal and 10-15 from fat free milk.",
"what happens to you, and how much do you weigh?",
if your spikes peak is before an hour then test around that time to see where that spike goes.,
and your weight matters for three reasons.,
1) blood mass: the more blood you have the more sugar it will take to get your blood sugar to the same level as someone with less blood mass.,
2)muscle mass: the more muscle mass you have the more chances insulin has to interact with a cell and remove sugar from your blood.,
3)fat mass: the more fat mass you have the less often muscle will allow insulin to put sugar into it.,
there are times when shortly after i've eaten my heart rate increases and it takes a few hours to calm down.,
it can be quite distracting and at it's worst i feel anxious and especially if it's before bed time it means i'm in for a sleepless night.,
it's improved a lot now and i'm aware it happens if i eat too much carbs in one sitting or too large a meal.,
"at the weekend i had a raised heart rate all day (i had a night out so a few too many white wine spritzers, i did have some more carbier things than normal on the day).",

"good idea viv, will try this thanks.",
"nigel, the internet frightened me so i came here instead to find out :lol: .",

"i went to doc and had ecg and everything was normal and it just seem to be an idiopathic thing, nothing to worry about so now i don't.",
"i'm sure it's not serious and is related to eating which will raise your rate of metabolism and therefore your heart rate but obviously if it continues, go to doctor and get a proper diagnosis, best wishes, debra x click to expand...",
i get the odd 'flutter' but it happens when i'm sitting with bad posture so the muscles across my erm upper chest just let me know that i need to sit up and relax.,
i've never had a blood pressure problem and my chol etc is fine.,
"it's definitely after eating, sometimes in the night (but again if i've eaten late or too big a portion).",
thanks for the replies everyone and to those that are wired :lol: i agree nigel i should get myself to the doc if it becomes a concern.,

"hi,thanks for all your replies.",
"i have been feeling tired but i just put that down to work,kids etc.the reason i was asking if it is possible to have a false positve is because last year i had a lump that was told was benign,when i had it removed 6 monthslater it turned out to be cancerous so i have no faith in the drs at all.",
i will ask for another test to be done but if that also comes up as being postive then i will deal with it and educate myself.im hoping it can be controlled with diet rather than with pills because i take enough pills as it.,
i have been reading the posts on here and am finding it very informative and if i am diabetic i will no doubt be asking more questions on here.,
once again thank you for your replies.,
"hi,just wanted to update this.",
"i had a glucose tolerance test at the hospital last friday.i got the results back yesterday and they were normal.the fasting one was 3.8 and the one two hours after the drink was 7.8.the only reason i can think of as to why the first two blood tests came up so high was because i used to drink a lot a lucozade,could this have caused the first two tests to come back so high?i gave up lucozade about a week before the glucose test.",
"i didnt have a drink of lucozade on the day of the tests,but certainly on the preceding days i did.",
"i have bought a blood glucose tester so will be keeping an eye on it.i am on a low fat,high carb diet because i had a liver resection last year and lost a lot of weight so im trying to gain weight but to do it an healthy way rather than just eating cakes and choc etc.",

essgirl,
hi # hope some could help?,
i take metformin slow release 500mg for my type 2 diabetes i have been on these now for about 14 months.,
now this may sound a really strange question but when i go to the loo i pass the metformin pill usually not in my motion but just floating in the top of the toilet.,
is this normal?,
the reason i am asking is because i have been having a lot of muscle pain and weakness in my arms and legs even picking a cup of tea up is quite hard to do so weak in my arm.,
also legs feel weak pins and needles numbness in my finger tips and feet.,
so guys is this normal to pass the pill when taking the pill its white when passing it's like a yellow colour not sure if the pill is working?,
just had a blood test a non fasting but everything was normal but i haven't told my gp about passing the pill i just feel so stupid walking in and saying in and telling him that i pass the pill in my motions.,
"please and advice would be appreciated thanks russell zand said: i would tell your gp, it isn't stupid at all if it's happening to you.",
"do you take the tablet with food, or on its own?",
i used to get this problem with taking supplements and tablets too.,
have you had antibiotics recently?,
i ask because they can destroy the good bacteria in us which can stop food etc being properly broken down and absorbed.,
there's a few supplements on the market which provide acidophilus which can help.,
i use one called udo's choice which has a microbiotic range to choose from and also a supplement to help digestion.,
the worst time for me was when i had two courses of double dose antibiotics and another ordinary one within five weeks.,
even my food came through totally undigested then.,
click to expand...,
yes i take my tablet about 30 minutes before my breakfast.,
"and i don't take any supplements really because i'm not sure what i can take, the only time i had antibiotics was about 6 month ago they said i had pylori bacteria and i must say i had such an awful time with the antibiotics diarrhea i could not leave my house for 2 weeks because of the need to use the toilet.",

thanks very interesting reading as to the weakness and pins and needles i did mention this a few weeks ago hence the blood test a non fasting one.,
"came back normal dr said don't worry about the weakness and numbness this is all part of diabetes neuropathy, but if my bloods are ok i don't understand why i would have neuropathy i haven't even had a test for neuropath problems so i'm at a loss of his explanation.",

here's our new monthly poll!,

would you recommend them to others?,

i have been called up for a fasting blood test which is only done in the morning.,
"if i didn't eat from (say) 5pm the night before, wouldn't the body dump glucose into the system overnight meaning it would read high?",
that's before i'm given the glucose drink.... wouldn't it be better to fast during the day and have the fasting test done late afternoon so i've had a chance to burn up the glucose by being active all day?,
am i missing something here?,
this is a fasting hba1c and lipid (specifically a fasting cholesterol test).,
i don't do manual work and can easily fast during the day.,
doesn't the body dump glucose into the bloodstream overnight meaning that glucose will be high first thing in the morning?,
thanks guys.,
the reason i am asking is that the surgeries i know (and hospitals!),
only do fasting blood tests in the morning.,
they don't do them in the evening which is more convenient for me yes i've asked for an exception but always come up against a brick wall.,
"i want something that's convenient for ""me"" without having to take time off etc.",
"i've had one of those letters for a ""free nhs health check"" as i'm over a certain age and in the second paragraph it states ""i must have a fasting cholesterol test"" although slightly ot, i am interested to see whether they feel i need to be put on statins so that practice targets can be met and practice managers get their commission.",
"but i will also use this opportunity to ask for another hba1c too i have no desire to ""beat the test"" but my surgery appears to be more interested in measuring my fasting cholesterol even though the letter states about a health check.",
this will be my first ever blood test at my own surgery...my last ones were at the hospital and my last cholesterol test there 18 months ago was well within normal so i am not expecting any surprises - unless they are keen to push statins on me.,
but i have also requested a hba1c for my peace of mind which i'm going to have done elsewhere.,
i have a blood form for this which says: 4.5ml edta eb hba1c separate sample required then.... glucose (fasting) so does this mean they'll do an hba1c and an ogtt?,
my doctor prescribed metformin for me but it has me feeling really unwell.,
does anyone know if the metformin extended release version has the same side effects such as stomach issues and just feeling like blah?,
i didn't have these symptoms until i started the metformin.,

i am going ask my doctor if i can try the extended release version.,

"i take my levothyroxine first thing, so do i have to wait an hour before eating and taking metformin?, what do other people do?, thanks.",
"there is an interaction between levothyroxine and metformin which affects the effiency of metformin and i just wondered how much time people usually leave between taking the two medications thanks phoenix, i shall have to wait awhile before eating breakfast, thanks baddabing, it might well be due to taking them all together.",
"the dn didn't say anything to me but i read it somewhere on the net and so decided to telephone a pharmacist, as i take furosemide as well.",
she told me they were not to be taken together as it would lower the effectiveness of the medications.,
"try asking a pharmacist your self or waiting an hour to eat, like me",

lately i have been getting a pain in my lower abdomen on the left side.,
i feel it when i am sitting but it's not very nice when i have to stand up.,
i was wondering if this could have something to do with diabetes?,

obviously i'm not going to run to the drs about this like a cry baby.,
just wanted to get a few ideas and opinions on what it could have to do with.,
"within the last few weeks i have started to cut down on metformin due to the successful control of my blood sugar levels, i was just cutting by missing a dose twice a week but this week i have cut from 500 mg twice a day to 500 mg just once in the morning after breakfast, i started this 7 days ago and at first i was ok.",
"yesterday and today has seen my health turn to the worst, i have been experiencing nausea and an upset stomach and all the side effects i had 14 months ago when i started taking this drug!",
but what is really worrying me is the psychological impact it has had on me with the onset of anxiety and depression.,
could the 50% cut i have made resulted in this?,
has anyone else had this experience?,
my blood sugar levels continue to be ok (at the moment).,
"please forgive me if i don't respond to all responses, i find the site difficult to navigate.",
hi and thanks for your for the above.,
i am reinstating to the prescribed dose as i want to be well for christmas.,
"i have read on similar forums that others have had similar depression and anxiety when stopping metformin, but it certainly isn't a common side effect.",
"but what i do remember is that when i started taking this drug, apart from the initial gastric problems i very quickly started to feel a much happier person, it was was like the met lifted me out of a trough and i have been a happy bunny until i cut my dose recently.",
"when i googled ""what are side effects of stopping metformin""?",
i got this result : diarrhea.,
vomiting.,
nausea.,
heartburn.,
abdominal cramps.,

i don't feel like i've got a virus.,

i will let you know how things go johnegreen said: to be honest i stopped taking metformin over a week ago with no adverse affects.,

i have gone back on 1000 mg again till the new year.,

google have made a complete mess when it comes to googling this subject!,
but i did find this further down the page: https://www.diabetesdaily.com/forum/type-2-diabetes/55368-side-effects-stopping-metformin/,
i have been experiencing a night time cough (more of a tickle in the back of my throat really) one and off for months and i have been trying to find a cause without success.,
"been down all the usual avenues, asthma etc.",
had lots of different treatments.,
nothing stops it.,
"the only thing that seems to connect with it is that it often happens on the days when my blood sugars have been a bit higher, but not always.",
anyone ever noticed that this happens to them?,
it is really disturbing my sleep and driving me insane!,
:crazy: i have looked into the side effects of the other meds i take and none list a cough as being one of them.,
"i'll look further into it though, thanks for your advice.",
if you'd said run up and down the street naked waving a plastic daffodil i'd probably give it a try!,
that's how peed off i am with the bloody thing disturbing my sleep every night.,
i have just got one of these but have let the family check the bg.,
this has now screwed up the average result feature.,
how can i delete their test results and retain mine or better still delete everything?,
can't see any obvious reset button.,
seems daft you can't delete results.,
i would love you to tell me how to reset it !!,
done the 2 arrows trick.,
did not work i'm afraid.,
no mine were 17 16 20 14 and the others were normal around 6 so it brought the average right down.,
but a real improvement today down to 13.,
hi hubby has recently started on metaformin as been diagnosed as t2.,
his sugar levels were about 7 when he started on these pill.,
now that he is up to two pills a day he is steadily high first in the morning between 12 to 15 & its starting in afternoon as well.,
coupled with blinding headaches he is starting to think he is better off without these pills.,
can anyone give me a clue as to why his sugar levels are rising on these pills but if he stops taking them for a couple days then his sugar levels reduce right down?,
thank you all he did ask diabetic nurse & she was unsure.,
although he is a healthy weight he has started to gain weight since starting metaformin.,
although he does eat a very healthy diet he has experimented by eating the same meals & quantities while on metaformin & then repeating the process without metaformin a few days later.,
he tests at the same times & always high readings on the tablets.,
yet normal range 5 or 6 while off the tablets.,
andbreathe said: hello sunflowers.,
did your husband adjust his diet at all when he started on metformin?,
did he receive any dietary advice from whoever wrote the prescription?,
click to expand... no dietary advice but he has never been overweight due to the way we eat as a family.,
he also does not add any sugar to his diet & we are careful about hidden sugars in foods.,
"have been on metformin now for just 2 weeks, first week 500 once a day & now twice a day, morning & night.",
touch wood not too many adverse effects?!,
"now, i know it's very early days but i'm finding that i'm still having spells when i'm weak & shaky & dizzy in the afternoon.",
i'm thinking praps i need a midday dose?,
i gather that slow release is a reluctant option for docs to prescribe cos it's obviously much more costly but aside from that does anyone know of any reason why standard maetformin is preferable to sr?,
seeing doc again tomorrow & it would be useful to be informed.....,
thank you experts!,
omg who do i ever believe?,
was told to lose weight & increase exercise for 3 months.,
nothing else.,
2 months on i was having horrid dizzy spells & palpitations.,
doc eliminated my thyroid as a cause.,
she did a blood test which was 11.2 an hour after my breakfast.,
took my bp which she said was up 148/90 (ish) & told me it was because my bllod glucose was going up & down & suggested metformin to stabilise this happening.,
i have been feeling less woozy since taking it but only for a few hours after the tablet.,
so i was assuming that i needed a midday one.,
my doctor does not want me to do any testing yet.,
she says it leads to obsession & is unnecessary at the moment.,
i know you lot don't agree with her.,
i just feel like i am wading though treacle (& can't even have a lick of it) cos everyone is telling me different things.,
arrrrggghhhhh!!!!!!,
why is it that it seems that every post asking a question on this forum unrelated to testing & low carbs always seems to end up back at those 2 issues?,
do i need to make this a rhetorical question?,
unless someone perhaps can explain the benefits of slow release metformin over the standard type!!,
while i am now on my soapbox .......,
"i would also like to say that make an observation that many of you use terms & abbreviations that, as a newbie, are of absolutely no meaning or help to me whatsoever!",
i appreciate that many of you have been living with diabetes for some time but i beg of you to please bear in mind that sometime you may as well be responding in japanese.,
thank you.,
thank you!!!,
i have now been on 500 x 3 metformin for just a week & i really do not feel any benefit.,
"have had a horrible ""hypo"" experience this lunchtime, 5 hours after my breakfast, just sitting in a meeting feeling fine but as soon as i moved .....whoah, the shakes, feeling so faint, head & heart pounding.",
i stuffed my face with totally inappropriate things i could find in the car just to feel better.,
"i'm sure it's not a true hyp as hanadr says, it just is a drop to a lower level but it's scary.",
i know i need to be better prepared & have something with me to eat but i was just sitting around feeling fine & not even thinking about it.,
i thought metformin was supposed to stop this happening?,
but when will it start to take effect?????????,
"hi catherine am low carbing (well low'ish) as i've been told to lose weight (& low carb is the only way i know) & increase excercise, not that i have ever been a couch potato, i have a stenuous walk for an hour every day (some days having to stop & rest co i feel so faint) & am swimming 3 or 4 times a week (half a mile per swim) i am also keeping a food diary & making a note of when ""hypo"" feelings occur ....... not finding much time for a life yet beyond all this!",
it's early days i know after just 3 weeks on metformin but i am just so fed up with feeling so ill. doc reckons some of this may be attributed to highish blood pressure but won't do anything about that until the metformin has time to kick in.,
i would have thought after 3 weeks that would be happening?,
hello everyone!,
i am newly diagnosed t1d.,
have already read so much about diabetes complications that i am now almost afraid to live.,
"is it possible to live long without problems with your eyes, heart or kidneys?",
or is that inevitable?,
i also wonder if my need for insulin will increase later (now i use approximately 4u of actrapid and 14u of protaphane)?,
"i have read that lots of people start with low doses but eventually have to increase it, is that true?",
thanks for help!,
"hi all i'm new and need some advice, my 3 year old has started showing all the signs of diabetes, weeing more she was dry at night now is very wet, drinking all the time it's as if she can not get enough in quick enough, dry mouth hungry and eating so much more but is losing weight tired teachers have said she has started falling asleep at pre-school waking up complaining that her feet and legs really hurt and itch but when i took her to the doctors urine test came back showing there was no sugar in it so that means she doesn't have diabetes and there is nothing more they can do am so worried about her she is not getting any better is there another way she can be tested?",

"i have dont some re-search on the web and found somthing called ""balanitis"", which is a yeast infection of some sorts.",
"but my re-search has found, that its somthing that i need to put up with for the rest of my life.",
"went to my g.p about 3 weeks ago and he just said that its down to my diabeties (like its something else i need to live with), but then said my hba1c is ok at 6.3%, he gave a cream called canesten hc, which is used for 7 to 8 days, as i was told, but the condition has slowly come back.",
"also for information, i have never had a hba1c over 6.3% for the last 2 years, before that is was 6.5% to be honest, its really getting me down now.",
"diet wise, i am a low carb man, my weight is normal, bp is fine, cholesterol is a little high at 5.9% - could that be the cause??",
has any1 got any advice.,
"thank you, dippy.",
"hi grazer, i do test before food and 2 hours laters and i am normally around the before food level.",
"e.g before food i am around 5.5 to 6.5mmol, 2 hours later i am the same.",
"i never normal check before exersise, when i have done i am around 5.5 to 6.5, but after exersise i am allways between 4.5 and 5.5mmol.",
"i always try to get back down to less than 6.5mmol 2 hours after food, as i know the national limit is 7.5mmol 2 hours after food.",
but this balanitis / thrush is really starting to get me down now.,
"as i guess all men worry about there bits, but as a diabetic, i tend to worry even more.",
"thank you, dippy.",
"hello there, how do i check my sugar in my urine?",
is there some sort of strips i can buy??,
also do non diabetics not get spiking?,
"also yogurt, i take it that i am ment to eat it???",
"sorry silly questions i know, but i dont know.. lol.",
thank you dippy.,
"hello mish1953, mate does feel like its not mine, never in my life had this before and its killing me.",

"i dam well hope so, but have been reading around this site, and once you have had it, it always comes back, over and over again.",
i hope not.,
"thanks, dippy.",
"i am back at the doctors tomorrow, so we shall see what he has to say about it.",
lol lol.,
"well hopefully once its cleared up, it will never come back again.",
ahhh i am still making tents in a morning which can be painfull.,
no need for the viagra yet.. lol lol lol.,
"but this diabeties lark, who know when one may need the little blue pill.",
thank you.,
dippy.,
"hi all, i was diagnosed t2 at the end of january 2018 and, as seems to be the case, was sent away from my surgery with a factsheet about nhs approved sensible eating and enough tablets to fall an elephant!",
"then i joined this community and learned stacks of info, got into self-testing and am learning to understand what happens to my sugars and when.",
i am considerably overweight so would like to loose a lot and have in the past with some success used slimming world but that really doesn't seem compatible now.,
having researched and tried various things the one that suits me best seems to be lchf.,
"my problem is that i'm not a grazer, i'm a one meal a day person, that one meal now is supper.",
does this fit with controlling my numbers ok?,
"how do other people on it split their meals, or not.",
"i'm off back to the surgery on tuesday for my 6 month (overdue) check with the nurse from hell, i have a bad attitude already about being lectured by her, all of which i will take sweetly then go my own way!!",
i should also say that i'm supposed to be taking 2000mg glucophage per day but they make me feel so ill that i'm only taking one (500mg) a day which seems to suit but i would really love to be able to get rid of that as well but do understand that i can't do this all at once and that may take time.,
any advice gratefully received.,

lucylocket61 said: what does a meal look like for you?,
higher fats and lower carbs should help you feel full and help suppress hunger.,
click to expand...,
normally meat/fish & veg.,
i've always struggled to eat fruit and would rather have veg.,
"in an ideal world when hormones aren't raging, during the week i'm inclined to live on stir-frys, meat/fish, onions, mushroom, a small amount of tomatoes and maybe a small amount of pineapple.",
"or roasted meat and roasted veg like carrots, onions & parsnips (maybe only a couple of times a week as they are higher in carbs).",
"sometimes i'll do homemade egg fried rice ( 50g rice is 11.5g carbs) with diced turkey breast (just for a change and normally only once a week) my cravings for chocolate and cake have mostly gone, i find it all too sweet now.",
"i've also recently discovered the joys of lemon water, so much nicer that just plain water and tasty hot or ice cold.",

the first few months of diagnosis have been spent switching from one thing to another trying to find out what suits therefore not sticking to anything for long enough to get results but i think i'm settled now for a lchf diet.,

hey i am planning to travel abroad soon.,
i learned i need doctor's letter to get my insulin with me.,
i asked the nurse and she said it costs 15 and i have to wait on week for that.,
she also said that people usually have prescription instead of the letter but she wasn't sure.,
so i'm asking you.,
will prescription do?,
how do you travel abroad?,
does it vary on the company i use?,
i am going by wizzair if it matters @helensaramay so what document do you show them during the security check?,
or you just go thought the check without showing anything?,
"i mean, during those 99 flights what happened?",
did they ask you for prescriptions or they didn't ask about anything?,
"ok, thank you very much for answers.",
you helped me a lot.,
hey.,
i got another question.,
should i have sealed unopened box of insulin pens or can i have already opened box or even pen with needle attached to it?,
or everything should be brand new and never used?,
"it gives me a question when we go back from our trip we used some of medicines in the visited country and when we go back the boxes are already opened, does it mean we can't bring them back once opened?",
or custom service doesn't give a duck and no one really pays attention?,
my sister is a diabetic.,
she is constantly falling asleep.,
she sleeps all day and all night.,
"if you are talking to her, her head will drop and she will fall asleep.",
its not a deep sleep because if you say her name loudly she will wake up.,
but 2 minutes later it will happen again.,
when she is home by herself she says all she does is sleep.,
she has had the sleep test but they say they can't help her.,
they don't know why this is happening.,
could the insulin she is taking possibly be the cause of this?,
her life is horrible and she is very unhappy.,
please someone help!!,

hello i have type 2 diabetes.,
"i love salted peanuts, but once i start i cannot stop eating them.",
"they lower my blood sugar, are they good for diabetics or not?",
"hi there: met my diabetic nurse today... who on request, gave me a free blood glucose monitor.",
yay!!,
"however, she was unable to give me the test strips and lancets.",
i have to buy them myself.,
which is tricky... because i'm disabled and on benefits... & the strips (so says the chemist) will cost me around 60 every five or six weeks or so.,
is this right?,
"it made me ever so cross... not least when the nurse remarked that if the nhs gave me the strips etc, they couldn't fund other things that people - on different meds - need.",
"so is my need less than others, because i'm only on metformin... & my bloods are only 108 something or other?",
"and if yes, why?",
"rant, rant, gnash... :evil: also, i was a bit (quite a lot) rude to her... which is totally wrong.",
not her fault i guess.,
but it did make me so very... erm... grrrrrrrr :wink: any thoughts or guidance people?,
lucja xxx ps: i don't really understand the numbers btw.,
108 is what?,
thank you you all... for taking the time to reply.,
for your wisdoms too.,
i've learnt loads today.,
doesn't resolve my dilemma of course ... but your kindness is proof positive that its good to share.,
"and yes, the 108 is my hba1c reading... taken three weeks ago.",
"it has come down a bit in subsequent weeks... but as you say daibell, it needs to be reduced.",
however the reading the nurse took today cited 12... which i'm told is a small improvement.,
woo hoo!!,
i do need to get my head round this low carb thing however.,
but baby steps right now.,
am currently proud of the veg i purchased today.,
green food not beige food.,
"for those that know me, that in itself is a total shocker :lol: love 'n' light -- lucja xxx martwolves said: [mod edit] good luck click to expand... rude, insensative, dismissive & upsetting response to someone who is looking for support & guidance.",

.....the title says it all.....just how i am feeling at the moment..... should i be bothered by the fact that he has not tested bs levels for the last two days....despite still injecting his insulin and driving...am wondering what readings he will be showing the diabetic nurse on monday or whether he will just complete his book with false readings as he has done in the past....whatever i say (or don't say) won't make a blind bit of difference so why waste my breath...... ...what a waste of a life .....when he spends the majority of the day just lying in bed....does nothing to help himself....no wonder i give up.....just getting on with my life..... enclave said: only one thing to think about now ...,

any chance of an answer?,
"you mentioned the above, guaranteed (quite rightly) to catch attention but then when provided with a solution, a simple one at that, you totally ignore the most important points and go back to the path that has been trodden so many times before..his readings, maybe speaking to the nurse sometime, message not getting through..",

i need to come off my statin as i'm planning on becoming pregnant.,
how can i stop it bouncing back up to high?,
do those benecol/ flora products do any good or are they all a bit of a con?,
"borofergie - i am not taking statins to avoid 'mortality' but to avoid exudative maculopathy, there is a clear link between cholesterol and leaking fattty deposits on to the macula.",
as maculopathy can increase in pregnancy anyway i don't really want to increase the risk but as statins can cause fetal malformations i can't take the statin if i'm trying to conceive.,
my doctor is looking to see if there are any non teratogenic (birth defect forming) statins i can have but the usual suspects have all come back with a no.,
didn't really want to give my money to the likes of benecol (benecon?),
so i'll be avoiding that one.,
"the practice nurse gave me a load of benecon pamphlets when i went on the statin, it just sounded like a big fat money making con to me.",
s'alright folks.,
saw my eye doctor and he says my maulopathy is burned out and unlikely to return.,
so he's said to come off the statin whilst i'm trying to get a bun in the oven/ whilst said bun is baking.,
"i'll decide what to do longer term after i've completed my family, have never found statins to be a problem for me and if it were not for the teratogenic effects i'd have no problem staying on them.",
"this is a really silly question, and i'm not sure how to word it.",
have been type 2 diagnosed from april 2011.,
sometimes my poo smells like perming lotion?????,
i have googles this and found reference to this being a sign of ketones?????,
can anybody clarify this for me please?,
i found out i was diabetic on 4th april 2011 and on &th was rushed into hospital.,
on the 4th i had ketones ++ in my urine.,
the doctors dont know whether i was rushed in due to my sugar level being 25 or a reaction to being put on metformin.,
i personally think it was the ketones as my sypmtoms from that night are more like ketoacidosis than a hyper.,
somewhat confused by this all and am worried that the ketones are back and obviously dont want to be a plank by asking the doctors this daft question.,
sorry for the long winded nature :?,
lol awe i know that but have you ever heard of this connection??,
"at the minute i know i have been managing my diabetes badly i had been doing really well, my last big blood test was 6% i think?",
was found to be diabetic last april purely by accident.,
"tbh i went to docs with a gynae problem and it was necessary for a urine sample to be taken and it was here the initial ketones were found, blood sugar test was 15 i think and the proper blood test came back the next day at 19 with a hab1?",
of 10.8.,
by the fourth day later my glucose level had rose to 25 and i became very sick very quick.,
"i just phoned 999, mad sweats laboured breathing stomach cramps etc.",
hospital took bloods and put me on saline drip.,
i really knuckled down and got everything under control.,
however from xmas my blood shave been quite high.,
over indulgence was main problem plus i stopped smoking in october.,
weight has quickly crept on.,
i have however lost around 7.9lb since last monday??,
i really dont know what to think and it is so hard to get appointment at docs.,
not sure if im over reacting being a drama queen that i am.,
thank you to everyone who responded to my query.,
i have since got ketone testing strips and so far they have been negative.,
i will continue to keep a check though.,
"i suspect my slacking on foods has caused the diabetes to ""misbehave""!",
lol.,
"i did however read somewhere on the internet about the ""perm lotion"" smell??",
remains to be seen.,
again thanks to all.,
continue to look after yourselves.,

on checking the nutritional information i ws shocked to see that the bar contained more calories than a normal cadbury's bar.,
this seems to be because it has significantly more fat.,

bulkbiker said: your doctor sounds like an idiot.. do you drive without looking at the speedo?,
"by monitoring your blood regularly you can see how you are reacting to foods, which to continue to eat and which to avoid.",
i'm afraid the real reason your doc said that is because the nhs will not pay for a blood glucose meter for you.,
that's why so many of us buy our own and keep quite detailed records of readings alongside a food diary.,
that was how i felt able to make my own informed decision to stop taking metformin ( i knew that my blood sugars were reducing by diet alone) and i got tired of spending hours on the toilet every day.,
that of course is my own personal experience and should in no way be construed as being advice as to what you should do..,
however forewarned is forearmed and there's no way i'd want to be in the dark for 3 months at a time as to how my remission of t2 was doing.,

"at the end of the day, all doctors are supposed to do is advise, with reasons.",
they cannot tell you to do anything.,
"the choice is yours, and yours alone.",
"in my opinion, and i am not alone in this, the finger prick readings from blood glucose meters are far more an accurate indication of how your blood sugars are than the hba1c.",
they tell you instantly what each meal has done to your levels if you test before you eat and 2 hours after first bite.,
"if the rise is too high you can change that meal to something less carby, right there and then, without waiting months for your next hba1c test.",
"most gps tell us not to test, and give a variety of excuses, but this is for financial reasons.",
if they told us to test they would be obliged to provide the mean to do it - and they can't do this because of the costs involved.,
"bite the bullet, ignore the gp, and buy your own meter.",
that is the only sensible thing to do.,

since 12 april ive been following a 20g carb diet.,
only had 3 cheat meals since.,
i tested my blood sugar levels last night and they were 17.5 - i have checked again this morning and it is 13.9 my sugars have been high for quite a while and i don't know what to do.,
"i have been really 'good' since last monday after a visit to the drs who said that my yearly results had come back and they were really bad and we couldn't let them stay that way, i also saw a diabetic specialist in the afternoon for the first time and he confirmed what my dr had said, basically my meds are not working any more.",
what can i do to get my sugars down?,
what am i doing wrong now?,
"what food can i eat, as i am afraid to eat now?",
please help!,
hello while i was driving home i felt very strange.,
"deep braething felt on odd pin/needle sensation in my head and also felt out of it, as i was passing tesco i stopped in the car park and tested my bg it was 4.9 which then sent me in a tailspin, i got some gluclose tablets and ate about 10 of them and i have also ate a packet of biscuits.",
my bg is now 9.1 ands as far as i'm concerned now the higher the better i have just been put on 80mg of glicizide and have been taking it for about 5 days as the metformin does not do much for me in reducing bg.,
did i have a hype even though i was not below 4 my levels have been between 12-18 pre glicazide.,
"i was going to not take any more meds and book myself in tomorrow to see the nurse or have i just panicked, i am not sure i want to take any tablets that can give you a hypo, i am a bit of a worrier and it will be on my mind all the time.",
"thankyou andy re: paniciked over blood gluclose of 4.9 thanks for your reply it was my first little episode and i got a bit scared and thought the best course of action was to consume everything down the chocolate isle in tescos, god knows what people did before this forum when they had a problem.",
"i now have my gluclose tablets,plus i will check my bg every hour tonight and keep a close eye on it tomorrow.",
"again thanks for the advice re: paniciked over blood gluclose of 4.9 hi i will just stick to 6 glucose tablets if it happens again, my over-reaction has so far got me up to 17.",
i am also going to join my local diebetic group.,

"i'm 34, recently diagnosed and my gp recommended today that i consider statins under nice guidelines.",

i exercise 3 - 6 hours a week and don't eat starchy foods and rarely eat sweet things/high saturated fat things etc.,
he was very helpful and told me not to rush to make a decision.,
he gave me lots of information to read up on as well.,
why am i being told i should consider this drug???,
what happens if i don't take it at all?,
"i've decided i'm not going to take it (a) side affects (b) age, i'm going to have to take this drug for a very long time...",
i've got a follow up appointment with the diabetologist in august so will talk to him.,
i've not had any medication prescribed yet for my diabetes as it's considered 'good control' on the basis of hbac1 results so far and they don't want to cause problems whilst i'm awaiting various other test results.,
"dougie22 said: sanobar, just another thought.",
"if you live in scotland, the official recommendations used by the nhs are the sign guidelines.",

click to expand... dougie22 - i had no idea about sign - been looking at nice all this time so thanks very much for this info.,

"hi everyone, am wondering how many of you out there that use levemir take it once a day and how many take it twice.",
"i didn't realise that twice was an option but have been reading ""think like a pancreas"" and it mentions it in there.",
also a few people on here have posted about splitting their dose.,
until recently i have been doing quite well but after a few too many morning hypo's i reduced my levemir to 18 units (from 20) which i take at 8 pm.,
now my levels are creeping back up again and i'm not to sure what to do.,
i have started by extra testing and careful noting of levels/carb intake and novorapid doses and then plan to get about a weeks worth and decide what to do.,
would like to hear from anyone using levemir on how many times a day they take it.,
also any other comments/advice would be really welcome before i come up with my cunning plan.....,
thanks in advance to anyone taking the time to reply.,
esther.,
"hi me again, thank you so much guys for taking the time to try to help me, i really appreciate it.",
"thank you also mentat and diabell for the ""skip some meals"" suggestion (i'm guessing that is what ""fasting basal tests"" means) that really sounds like good fun !!",
lol.,
seriously though i have loads of meals that don't include any more than 20g of carbs would that count d'you think?,
or does protein do something naughty too?,
for e.g.,
i might have two boiled eggs with a green salad for lunch then i wouldn't take any novorapid.,
so in theory my levemir should keep me on track right?,
also my dsn recommends that i should only adjust my dose if i have high/low readings 3 consecutive days in a row.,
is that what everyone else does?,
(i love her by the way - she is awsome).,
"yes i would love to keep my sugars stable overnight, but how d'you know?",
"me-thinks maybe i'm not, because sometimes i wake up feeling like rubbish and actually if i'm gonna have a hypo it's usually in the mornings.",
"i have changed one thing recently, well begining of september if that counts as recently i started back going to the gym.",
"at first i felt great and no significant change in my bg levels ( so hopefully not that then) and now i still really enjoy it but my levels are a little messy... once again, any advice gratefully accepted.",
esther x hello me again!,
right so definately need to do this fasting basal testing to find out whats going on then.,
"i'm kind of desperate (using the term loosely, i'm quite a laid back kind a gal) to get my stuff on a bit of a better trak as i'm going on holiday on tuesday and not only will there be a four hour time difference it will be quite hot and i will be staying in a hotel, which i always find quite difficult food wise, however very lovely in every other way!",
so for the last two nights i have gone to bed at a round 8 then tested at 4 am last night 5.2 and 3am thursday night 5.3 - so all good.,
"(don't have to set the alarm, wake up at all sorts of time through the night just randomly) then both mornings have woken at 4.3 and 4.2 respectively this morning i was shaking like i was quickly heading to hypo, i didn't actually get there luckily i got up quickly and had my breakfast - so no problem there but if i had of been in hotel i wouldn't have been able to get my food quick enough - and anyway feel that is s bit low to wake up to.",
so if this carries on for tomorow too then the advice would be to lower my levemir?,
"but my hba1c has gone up not down, i am fairly confident about my carb counting and insulin ratio but have not been adding anything for the protein i eat (quite a lot) maybe i need to look into that.",
maybe either i need to increase my ratio for fast acting insulin in the afternoon evening (although i tend to get my carbs in in the mornings if i can) or my levemir is not covering me for those last four hours and that is increasing my levels.,
am i getting this right or is this a lot of waffle??,
"""golly gosh"" this diabetes is a pain in the seating area!",
hope everyone has happy levels today and a nice weekend x wow i have a lot to learn!,
think i'm gonna have to leave the fasting testing until i get back from my holiday unfortunately.,
so probably gonna have to live with my messy numbers for a couple more weeks.,
noblehead (thanks for your response by the way) do you mean my levemir by my nighttime dose?,
maybe i could drop that before i go to stop these morning lows - whatd'you think??,
even though i've been seeing some high numbers.,
"i don't think anyone has ever mentioned to me about using insulin to cover protein, but now that you've said it it does make sense, otherwise where would we be getting our energy from.",
i'm going to take some reading for research to read on the beach (sorry to mention the beach to anyone not enjoying our oncoming british winter!).,
"any recomendations would be welcome, especially re.",
"the protein thing, but anything i can learn from would be good.",
"esther x thanks noblehead and diabell, think i'm gonna drop the levemir by 1 unit tonight,(or maybe wait one more day) although i am convinced at the moment that this 18 hour thing is causing me issues and am reluctant to increase my novorapid especially at dinner time (by that i mean the evening meal) cause i hate hypos, at the moment it seams like you either run the risk of having high levels or run the risk of hypos - yuk yuk yuk!!!",
i have my carbs in the morning because i think the begining of the day is when i most need the energy.,
i am finding that i drop 2-3 mmol during my gym session so my reckoning was thats a good time to take on the carbs.,
i'm still fairly new so forgive my ignorance.,
"i don't eat that much fat (not cause i don't like chocolate cake, cheese, chocolate, butter, chocolate...and all those yummy things), i am 9st and 5ft4.5, and almost 48 yo, and my last hba1c was just short of 9 so what am i doing wrong - its so annoying esther x :?",

"had a look around the net but couldn't find a definite answer had my field test done on thurs 31st but license also ran out the same day question is, am i still legal/allowed to drive while i'm waiting for the decision?",

"thanks re: licence expired, awaiting dvla medical decision, can i d no worries, i could see what u meant anyways thanks for the info anyway, i don't think i would of beein in this situation if dvla hadnt of taken so long in processing after my 2nd lot of forms went through which took nearly a month!",
i am a nurse in the us.,
my stepfather has type 2 diabetes.,
in september 2009 i noticed that he had a small black area under his toenail.,
"his doctor said it was a blood blister, which i thought was not a proper diagnosis, as it hadn't disappeared by december of 2009.",
haven't looked at his feet much until today.,
now he has four blackened areas under four toenails and two small black areas on one toe toward the end of the toe by the foot.,
i know this is dead or dying tissue.,
i will be taking him to the doctor asap.,
has anyone out there actually dealt with this condition before?,
what were your experiences?,
went to the doctor.,
"black spots, fortunately were related to scabs from blisters breaking open due to athelete's foot.",
"the podiatrist will be seeing my stepfather on a regular basis, however, due to lack of sensation in his feet related to diabetic neuropathy.",
"first, my stepfather does not have a good hga1c and has no intentions of changing his lifestyle.",
"second, i can't make him.",
i am a nurse and have educated him about this for years.,
"he chooses to ignore education and advice from everyone, including his own doctors.",
my stepfather has selective hearing and hears only what he wants to hear.,
eg.,
the doctor told him that he needed to delete all sugar from his diet.,
"my stepfather heard, ""i need to adjust my insulin if i want sugars.""",
"you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink.",
this fits my stepfather completely!!!,
he is making his life choices.,
all i can do is educate.,
he has been to several specialists regarding his neuropathy.,
the conclusion is that he has absolutely no feeling in his feet and legs when pricked with a needle.,
"the neuropathy has now run its course and is rampant throughout his body, affecting his gastrointensinal system.",
"his heart is, so far unaffected, as he passed his stress test.",
i don't think that this will last and that eventually his heart will also be affected.,
"he has eye problems, specifically diabetic retinopathy, as well as a possibility of open angle glaucoma.",
"he feels that he should live his life the way he wants to, darn the consequences.",
we have 5 family members that are in the medical field and we can't make him understand what he is doing to himself.,
neither can the doctor's or nurses that he has seen over the last 10 years.,
"in the meantime, we just keep plugging away at education and he keeps ignoring it.",
"he is depressed and takes medication, but refuses to see a psychiatrist.",
we do the best we can.,
that's all we can do.,
"hi all, i'm new here, i've joined because i've had repeat episodes of unstable blood glucose levels, i found this out as i started having what at first seemed to be seizures, which coincided with having very low or high levels, i'm due to have a fasting test tomorrow but in the meantime i've been using a monitor to keep track of things, today i tested first thing and it was 10.2 which shocked me, however i can only find conflicting ideas about what my morning level should be, is 10.2 particularly high?",
"many thanks i should say i also sweat a lot at night, and wake up shaky and with headaches thanks for your responses everyone.",
"i haven't been diagnosed with diabetes yet, i'm waiting for a blood test result to come back, but i've been checking it myself with a monitor, my levels fluctuate wildly, they're high in the mornings, and during the day go from 5.9 to 9.9 and anywhere in between.",
"yesterday for example i woke up with 10.2, after brekkie it was 6.7, then later before lunch it was 5.7, then shot right up to 9.9 after lunch!",
"i do go for long periods without eating , partly due to being a mum and also because i struggle with eating (i had anorexia for many years when i was younger) , and when i do eat its high carb and high sugar to give me energy.",
obviously that needs fixing!,
"my episodes, which at first were suspected to be epilepsy, involve me losing all muscle tone and going floppy or collapsing, my eyes flicker, and my muscles contract causing convulsions and twitches, and teeth clenching.",
"i saw a nurse today and she said these episodes could be hypos/hypers, and that my low blood pressure , which causes me to feel dizzy and lose my vision, could also be linked to my glucose levels.",
"i don't know anything much about diabetes, my mum has it but she still eats really badly so i wont get any tips from her lol",
"anonymous question submitted: hi i was just wondering can you lose your hair from taking metformin im really scared and so paranoid about my hair to submit a question, please go to http://www.diabetes.co.uk/ask-an-anonymous-question.html",
hi all my husband is an insulin reliant diabetic since the age of 2 (on pump treatment for the past 28 years).,
he had laser treatment on both eyes 28 years ago and has regular checkups at the various diabetic clinics.,
(he's 46 now).,
"he has, up until now, always held a 3 year renewable licence.",
this february his licence was up for renewal again - but unfortunately he failed the visual field eye test.,
he has always had trouble with the field of vision test as it involves flashing lights on a board - and as a result of his laser treatment this is an ongoing problem for him.,
when we got the letter from the dvla we were shellshocked - no driving will possibly mean no job soon as he is self-employed .,
"since the letter arrived in march i've been taking time off my job to drive him to wherever he needs to get to, but obviously this can't be a long term solution or i'll need to give up work completely.",
public transport isn't really an option either as he has so much stuff he needs to bring with him.,
he apparently missed 2 clusters of lights in the test so obviously this was a fail.,
the dvla said we could get a 2nd test done at the opticians - which we did.,
the lady in the opticians said he failed to see 1 cluster of lights this time - but apparently 2 sets is a fail but 1 set can be acceptable??,
we sent off the results to the dvla again - but today we've heard back that they are still revoking his licence based on his test results.,
the strange thing we found was that the optician even said to us that his eyesight itself had actually improved in the past year - and as such his prescription for glasses has been reduced.,
is there any point in taking this to a magistrates court for a final decision (especially as it affects his life to such a degree) or do we need to give up now?,
he hasn't had any driving accidents in the past 5 years and doesn't drive at night.,
is there any possibility of getting a dawn to dusk licence - or do you advise us to just accept it (as you can imagine its very difficult!!).,
i'd love to know if anyone has ever had a successful outcome of this going to the magistrates court - or if i'm just grasping at straws.,
thanks in advance.,
re: dvla revoked driving licence - any advice?,
hi all i thought i'd come back here and update - just to give people hope really!!,
hubby got his licence back today !!!,
:mrgreen: :mrgreen: only for 12 months - but it's better than no licence at all.,
(then we'll go through it all over again!).,
we really did have to battle for it though .,
the saga began back in march when the dvla orginally revoked his licence following a fail on the field of vision test.,
we had the test redone in april but the dvla told us on the phone that the test wasn't good enough so the licence wouldn't be reinstated.,
however - what they didn't tell us on the phone was the reason the test wasn't accepted was that boots opticians had done the wrong eye test!!,
when we got the rejection letter in april it simply stated that the test done by the optician wasn't the right one - but we could still send in a 2nd visual field esteman test if we wanted to.,
we went back to boots - got the right test done - and sent it off to the dvla.,
they got it in may and finally wrote back to us in june enclosing an application form for a new driving licence - also stating that as my husbands original photo licence was nearly 10 years old we'd have to submit new photos too.,
we returned application form and photos the day after we got them from dvla.,
"then we waited, and waited and waited..................",
finally we rang them up to see what the hold up was - apparently they were waiting for us to resubmit a new medical disclosure form - but they hadn't asked for it and we had no way of realising that they needed one as we'd submitted one back in january with original application.,
guy told us to go to the internet and download the form and then send it into them asap.,
we did it the same day and sent it special delivery.,
no changes in medication or treatment for the past 7 or 8 years so didn't think anymore of it.,
"again we waited, and waited and waited.",
finally rang them again and they then told us that they were now writing to the hospital consultant to confirm the medical form we'd done - even though the consultant had signed for us in january too!!,
they sent the form to the hospital - where it stayed for 2 weeks with nothing happening on it.,
:evil: eventually i managed to speak to the consultant (probably because the nurses were sick of me ringing all the time ).,
she said she'd have to see hubby again before signing off the form - so we went to the hospital at 4pm to get form signed.,
she saw him for 4 or 5 mins - and then gave us the forms back signed.,
to speed it up a bit we faxed the forms to the dvla and then rang to confirm safe receipt.,
only to be told that faxes are not looked at for 3 days after delivery as they are busy!!,
after pleading with them to at least check safe receipt they confirmed they had the forms now - and all we could do was wait for the medical panel to review them.,
thank god they finally phoned us to say the licence has been approved for 12 months - and should be with us on thursday this week.,
to say we're relieved is a massive understatement.,
"i've been driving hubby to work and getting to my own job 2 hours late - and then leaving my job 1 hour early to go collect him - luckily my employers agreed to me working like this until september so that i'd have the chance for hubby to keep his job until we had a definate, final answer.",
if no licence then he would have tried to find alternative job somewhere he could get by public transport - but as he's been made redundant twice in the last 12 years he didn't really want to move from his current job.,
anyway - now i'm rambling - sorry!!,
just wanted to say that if this ever happens to anyone on here - fight and argue and try and try again.,
the dvla haven't made it easy - each time we send them something it always took on average 5 weeks for a response - then we'd respond and have to wait 5 weeks again for next response and so on and so on!!,
thanks for all the support you've given - it really has been appreciated.,
can anybody explain why the blood pressure range appears to have lowered.,
when i was diagnosed in 2015 i was told my pressure should be 130/80 or thereabouts.,

when did this change?,

i am grateful for your suggestion and your vast knowledge on the right foods for diabetes.,
"i keep kosher, which would definitely preclude any pork products, but if you can think of any other non-pork and non-shellfish related suggestions that would be a great help.",
i once saw a product called salmon jerky.,
i bet something like that might be like a pork rind.,
it is overwhelming to be in this food rehab situation.,

"hi, i am type1 diabetic and have been for last 28 years.",
have always had tight control and long term count (that hc1 thingy!),
has always been below 6.,
anyhoos last week whilst at my diabetc clinic appointment i gave a urine sample and had my period at the time.,
blood was present in my sample and doctor mentioned this and asked if it was monthly period.,
yesterday i get letter from clinic saying they have traced protein in my urine and want me back for second test.,
"doctor said she thought this was most likely due to blood in urine sample, but wanted to check to be doubly sure.",
well i have googled all this and it is appar the case that menstruation can cause fale protein reading in urine...but am still petrified that maybe i have start of kidney disease and am going to die before i get to 43!!!,
anybody able to help me out on this one?,
how likely would ckd be in a well-controlled diabetc?,
everything else at clinic was fine.,
just this darned urine thing....grrrrr thank you so much for your very positive and careful response!,
i have had a wee look on the internet and yes you are correct it's no major horror story and ace inhibitors can pretty much deal with it and stop fast progression.,
i have today had the delivery of my protein urineanalysis sticks which i bought off the internet from a pharmacy!!!,
(i am a nightmare for going off and diagnosing myself way before the hospital has time to!!!,
"lol) anyhoos, did an early morning test and it came back negative.",
have tested a few times today and it is still negative.,
then very deviously...did another test but this time dribbled a good few bits of blood from my finger into the urine and hey bingo came up a darker green colour showing positive.,
so it does indeed seem to be blood that can affect the result.,
"anyway, i am best off leaving it to the professionals and hoping that it comes back a negative and was just due to my silly periods...if not i have to man up and be as positive as you are and just deal with it.",
after all what else can we do???,
but thank you so very very much for answering my post.,
i am sure you have got things sorted out with your diet and glucose levels and are battling the kidney thing successfully.,
i wish you all the best healthwise and pray for your levels to always stay at 25 and to never dip ever.,
"hi, i just thought i would respond on my initial thread incase anyone else had similar problem or question later on.",
i got my urine test results back yesterday and there was no sign of any protein in my urine and so it seems that the protein was indeed from the menstrual blood and nothing else.,
really quite daft of them to even have bothered testing my urine at such a time of the month...made me worry for no reason!!!!,
"anyway, i will continue to keep my sugars as low and stable as is humanly possible for another 20 years or so....hopefully they will have a cure for this illness my then!!!!!!!",
thanks for all answers during my time of worry.,
hi this is my first post on here .so has anybody heard anything about research into i.g.f and the claims by an american doctor that this treatment is a cure for diabeties ?,
"type 1 and type 2 he claims can be cured in a 14 day course of treatment , also he recons that the large pharmisuitical firms know all about i.g.f but are refusing to back the research because it would cost them millions in lost revenue.",
i was diagnosed with type 2 in june this year 9g.i 125) at that time .,
i have followed a simple princapul of sticking to the weights and mesures given to me by my doctor and in november this year my g.i was down t0 52 nearly down to the target of 48 .,
in the interim i have needed treatment for retinopathy injections in the eye not a happy moment in time but at least they seem to have worked just checkups every couple of months now and i have sensory neuropathy requiring constant medication .,
i came across this ad claiming a cure last night and folloed the information that he gave out seems to suggest that these i.g.f's have a more benofical use than was first thought because the original research was applied to regeneration of the pancrease .,
he reckons through a claimed 32 medical studies that if this is applied actually to cleaning your liver back to a clean state that your body will produce far more of igf 1 a growth hormone which replaces dead or damaged cells but also ingreases the production of igf 2 this is not common in adults as it is thought to be a primary building block of an infant.,
when the increase of the 2 igf'd are added to each other the doctors claim is that they are 100% better at digestihg glucose in the body .,
he claims the pharmasutical companys have total knowlage of this research but do not want to use it as in america alone it would cost them $250 million a year in lost revenue .,
far better if all diabeties sufferers go to an early grave paying thousands a year for medication that does not really offer a solution .,
"hi, could anyone who is on metformin tell me if they are suffering hair loss, and did it get worse when your dosage was increased?",
are you on any other medications which could cause this?,
thanks for your help.,
aileen,
i seem to be hungry all the time.,
"yesterday i had a large roast dinner, dessert and a large piece of cheesecake and i was stll hungry.",
had a big bowel of shreddies this morning and less than 1/2hr later im starving again.,
i hate feeling hungry all time!,
im type 2 on insulin.,
ive looked at low carbing and what people eat and thats not for me.,
ive only been feeling this way for a few days.,
the cheesecake wasnt straight away maybe an hour after ny lunch.,
i only drink tea.,
"i dont always feel like this, just now and again, it will last around a week or so.",
"i do appreciate all help im given i have looked at this site and most of the food on the low gi, i dont like.",
"im not a picky eater but when i have read on here what some people are eating on a regular basis, just turns my stomach.",
im sorry too i wish i was able to change what i eat.,
some examples of what i eat breakfast is usually shreddied/cornflakes and sometimes weetabix.,
"lunch is a sandwich/couple of rolls/biscuits tea this week so far pasta, fish fingers, chips and baked beans, mc donalds and 2moro is chicken and gravy pie, brocoli, mashed potato and carrots.",
please can somone give me some advice.,
for about 18 months i have suffered extreme night time sweating with insomnia that typically comes on around 2-4am at night.,
at one point i thought i would have to leave work since i was so tired because the night time was proving so traumatic for me.,
typically i would have a healthy tea around 8pm and then usually top this off later and spoil it with biscuits and or cake or anything sweet really.,
"i am very slim do a lot of exercise, but get bad sweet cravings and would typically follow this eating pattern every night picking on sugary food right up til bed.",
"i would then awake around 4am when the room was freezing cold due it being winter, and i would be burning up and be soaked with sweat.",
despite the extremely low temperature of the room i would remain too hot and unable to sleep until about 5-6am.,
at about 6am my body temp returns to normal and i feel cold againa as i should and put the duvet back on and can then finally sleep.,
i went to the doctor who asked if i was worried or anxious.,
(at that point i wanted to throw something at him).,
so i spent 6 more months in misery.,
"my health got worse and i experinced extreme stomach pains too in the evenings that knocked me for 6..the doc put it down to a second stomach ulcer, but i'm still a little skeptical about the diagnosis as i was in a really bad way in the nights....",
i then got some some protein shakes for the gym and was over the moon when i discovered a protein shake before bed could help to stop the attacks...,
"i did some reading and have considered reactive hypoglycemia, bought a tester and was shocked to find results as low as 1.8 in the middle of the night!",
"i pee silly amounts of time in the night, (not unusual to be 10 times in 1 evening, but small amounts) and willl sometimes go one after the other and have no infections or anything like that.... but then again i always have a drink of tea on the go...",
i know that sugar is the culprit here.,
as soon as i stop the sugar the problems stopped.,
"however, i have started slipping and having the odd biscuit here and there and my symptoms have flared up again plus some other things.",
"so i thought i would try ask another gp when i moved and i went to see him today and he said "" are you stressed at work"" grrrrr .",
"why won't they understand, i'm talking extreme heat which causes the insomnia not stress :x anyway, he then said he would do a blood test.",
"my question are: does it sound like reactive hypo and if so, would a fasting blood test fail to pick it up?",
"(this is my concern )since things seem okay by the time i wake up...my own home blood sugar results are showing very low during the night, but then are fine at breakfast ... do i need to do an oral glucose test or something of that nature.",
or could it be diabetes?,
"i have just recently, contrary to the above, been experiencing repeated uti bouts.",
"i am male and 36, physically fit and aside from the sugar cravings, really look after myself.",
many many thanks for any advice you can offer...i feel like i'm getting no where at the moment!,
richard thank you for your reply..that is interesting...,
"does this mean i have a disorder since other people can eat sugar and not be messed up all night, and i wonder if it is doing other damage i am not aware of..i'm confused.",
"actually, carrot cake is my favourite...probably because it's full of sugar!!",
:twisted: thank you for all your replies :wink: wow that link from eliminator was amazing ..thank you...at least i know i'm not going mad!!,
...i wonder if the people in the link were getting the positive effect of protein like me since i know some bran (to my surprise) contains high protein..,
i imagine my condition whatever it is could go undiagnosed for years for the same reasons.,
"i fully expect my fasting bloods to be fine...probably because i eat mostly in the evenings, so i think it's steady in the day.",
"my diet has been bad the last few days, i get a bit low/tired and then i just think 'what the heck' and then suffer the consequences in the middle of the night.",
but thank god i know what it is now...when i didn't know what was causing the over heating/insomnia life was difficult...i only have myself to blame now and i feel more in control of things.,
i would like a more scientific idea of how much sugar i can get away with rather than just continually pushing boundaries when i get cheesed off though!,
"regards, richard",
"anonymous question submitted: i have had, diarrhea and rotten egg type burps for months now, is this anything too do with diabetes please?",
"to submit a question, please go to http://www.diabetes.co.uk/ask-an-anonymous-question.html",
i have had type 1 diabetes since 2003 and its has always been quite badly controlled.,
over the past few years i have been more aware of the affects of poor control and have been trying my hardest to keep it in control.,
this morning i had a blood sugar reading of 32.0.,
this is after fasting for 12 hours and taking my background insulin before bed last night.,
i have spent my morning looking into cbd oil as i am willing to try anything to help me get my blood sugars down to my target.,
"has anyone tried it and if you have, did you notice a difference ?",
"hi all, yet again i have awful sciatica (or so i and my gp think!)",
"pain in bum cheek, shooting down leg in to foot and making ankle, knee and foot tingle, go numb etc.",
my gp said its not neuropathy because my bum cheek aches and the sensations shoot etc and i have no weakness in limb as such.,
"sometimed my leg ""feels alive"" as though someone's moving ruddy house in it.",
how does neuropathy manifest then?,
"thanks chris thanks folks, it has eased a little today, sounds like sciatica is right diagnosis then.",
chris,
got some of my results it was a nurse my cholesterol has went from 4.5 to 5.6 but she said that the low number was fine i as i asked about ratios as i have heard people mention on here is that a worrying figure?,
i'm not diabetic i started lchf as my hba1c was 43 it's now 40 and i have that part under control just a little scared of the cholesterol rising will it stop she did say my triglycerides were good i'm sure it was that anyway low carb high fat it means what level does statins get prescribed my hba1c is within normal range i've also read a lot saying that cholesterol isn't as big a factor as made out to be and depends what the ratios are,
can you please tell me the good and bad fruit that i can eat.,
been t2 for 15 years now.,
not apples or pears.,
i know grapes aren't that good for you.,
i love water melon but not sure if it contains alot of sugar.,
over the years it's changed so much of what you can or can't eat.,
gets very confusing at times.,
"hi everyone hope you are all well , i am looking to get my first diabetic tattoo and i have made an enquiry to a local tattoo place with the tattoo that i want, they replied back and also said that i should check if i can get a tattoo with being diabetic, i know we can have tattoos but do i need to check with my dsn before having it done?",
"as i have seen you need good control, but not sure how to go about.",
thank you.,
"thank you everyone for your kind responses, i will definitely be getting my first tattoo and will post a picture when ive had it xx hi everyone!",
hope you are all well!,
here is the tattoo,
unbelievable yesterday i took metformin 30 minutes after i ate last night 8 pm and it was working great my sugar after 2 hours of eating roti and sardines was 140 when i woke up today and took a fasting test 12 hours not eating it read 143 and when i eat a roti and sardines it read 240 wow this is worse than when i didn't even take it.,
yeah i know i have to go to the grocery and get low carb stuff but before i even do that i needed to know if and how metformin works with a normal lifestyle and turns it it is worse than when i wasn't even taking meds the only other tablet i take besides metformin is atenolol i was prescribed 500mb regular metformin i am thinking a couple things 1) maybe it takes a week or more for metforming to actually start working?,
2) the metforming worked great within the first 6 hours and then after 12 hours my sugar started reading as if i don't even take metformin.,
"my doctor said the special thingy in the blood test was 9% and it should be <7% hey guys i am back, so i went to the grocery today and i bought items based on the low carb meal plan.",
i bought local chicken breast like 3 packs and i bought 3 tins of black beans we have excellent healthy stuff in the caribbean here its much healthier than imported american meat.,
i also bought some broccoli and i planted 100 okra trees in my garden.,
(my mother has 2 acres of land so i spend a lot of time in the garden now to get exercise and to plant stuff to cut back on my grocery bills as much as i can.,
i have completely eliminated all wheat and rice from my diet.,
i hear parboiled rice isn't that bad am cutting it out just in case.,
now i plan on grilling this chicken with bar b que sauce in the oven and eating it with black bean stew but will put it in the fridge and warm up to eat for 3 days because it isn't too feasible to run an oven everytime just to cook a piece of meat.,
"^ thanks i figured out that the metformin currently has zero effect on me even on the second day, so i will await a week or 2 again to see if it kicks in.",
"i hope i don't have type 1 diabetes here the doctor said its type 2 but he gave me additional gliclazide tablets to take but i am afraid to take it, he might yell at me for not taking it when i go back lol.",
he said my pancreas is probably operating at 50% effeciency which is why he gave me it.,
but i don't wanna overwork and force my pancreas when i could probably control this through diet and exercise you know what i mean?,
neohdiver said: i'm very cautious about gliclazide (or any sulfonylurea).,
"there are some studies that suggest that sulfonylureas wear out the beta cells in the pancreas (either temporarily or permanently) - so while you wouldn't become dependent on them, they might move you to insulin faster than not taking them.",
they also put you at risk for hypos if your carbs are too low - so it interferes with your ability to control your bg with diet since you have to eat a certain number of carbs in order to prevent hypos.,
"click to expand... hi there thanks i am happy to report i have successfully cut out all rice and wheat from my diet, i have moved to barb b que chicken and black beans.",
"i am happy to report after eating black beans, bar b que chicken and a glass of full cream milk while doing exercise earlier tonight my blood sugar read 130 two hours after my meal.",
metformin is not working for me as it needs 3 weeks and i only started using it 3 days now.,
so by simply switching around my diet and getting some exercise i have cut my sugar by 100 points it was usually 240 on average after eating.,
i am also losing weight and i feel great.,
this is a remarkable turn around for me i could only imagine if the met formin was actually working?,
wow it would have been like 100 reading or 90?,
who knew diet and exercise could do such magic?,
damn,
"so my gp prescribed me 30/500 cocodamol and i took two this morning and well after 30 mins, i looked as white as a ghost, felt spaced out, dizzy, really nauseous and i just wanted to sleep....is this normal???",
"8/500 has no effect on me, 15/500 has a slight affect on me but boy 30/500 knocks me for six!",
lol took 2 about an hour ago and i want to sleep now aha but yet when i took 2 last night i was fine....yet i took them so i could sleep.......always the way!!,
"fatgirl1965 said: try taking 1 of the 30/500 co-codamol with 1 normal paracetamol, i find that this combination helps with the pain without making you too lightheaded/ sleepy click to expand...",
but on the packet it says not to take other paracetamol products with it???,
ihs said: take the codeine before going to sleep and take something less sedating during the day.,
what about the cold gel patches that can be bought or tens?,
medtronic also supply pain relief devices in addition to insulin pumps click to expand...,
took it before bed last night but didn't seem to have too much of an effect on me than it does in the mornings if that makes sense??,
this is the only thing out of the hundreds (exaggeration) of things that i have taken that wants to work!!,
"jaylee said: i knew someone addicted to cocodamol.. yep, that was always the way!",
click to expand...,
i wouldn't like to say i am addicted lol....only just started taking them!,
"jaylee said: don't worry, i'm not suggesting by any means that you are...",
"but i've seen the effects when used to ""self medicate"" purely against life's daily challenges...",
the symptom characteristics you have described are similar... click to expand... oh aha good!,
it does help the pain though......kind of lol!,
but i did feel terrible yesterday..not so bad today though thank god!,
fatgirl1965 said: the 30/500 co-codamol is basically 30mg of codeine and 500mg of paracetamol.,
"if you take 1 co-codamol and 1 paracetamol you would not be increasing the paracetamol dose, you would just be losing 30mg of the codeine which is the bit that makes you lightheaded and sleepy.",
just don't take more than 1000mg of paracetamol in any one dose of tablets.,
i hope that makes sense click to expand... oh right yes that makes perfect sense thank you giverny said: codeine is miracle stuff - seems to be the only pain killer that works for me without any other side effects.,
"gotta be careful with it though, they warn you about addiction for a reason.",
the drowsiness is normal but if it's affecting your day too much i'd have a word with the doctor and see if they can prescribe something else.,
click to expand...,
it doesn't bother me too much now lol as i am sitting at a desk lol and just makes me wanna sleep haha!,
doctor won't give me anything else as i think the next thing would be tramadol and well that's stronger isn't it?,
ihs said: have you got a date yet for the back op?,
"if you haven't, try writing a letter to the consultant explaining yr circumstances re tiredness at work which in turn affects yr ability to concentrate and affects yr employment.",
see if you could take a cancellation.,
most consultants will do their best to oblige if they can.,
click to expand... no i haven't got a date yet as my last appointment i was told to either have the op or injections and that i had 2 months to decide.,
and my appointment with the surgeon is 17th october!,
"mine is when people say 'oh, i thought you couldn't eat sugar'...",
i'm always like are you freakin' serious?,
"good morning all, i posted on here last week as my blood sugar readings were 5.6 after i had eaten a fair amount of sugary foods about an hour beforehand.",
"that say, my readings were 5.6 and this morning i decided to test myself again but only this time, before i'd eaten anything.",
"to my dismay, the reading was 5.6 again and i'd hoped it would have been below 5.6.",
"however, i did eat a small chocolate bar last night around 11:30 just before going to bed (i'm trying to get away from this habit - perhaps now i've learnt my lesson).",
is this reading normal first thing in the morning?,
i'm a 28 year old guy and i'm around six foot tall.,
i'm very very slightly overweight according to my body mass index which was at the top end of the normal range.,
"i exercise regularly and i'm now worried that with a reading of 5.6 an hour or so ago before eating that i could be heading for trouble, any opinions or advice most welcome, thanks thanks to both sarah69 and borofergie for your inputs, borofergie, what is a glucose intolerance test?",
i'm interested to know about this.,
"so, does the fact that i didn't fast for 12 hours and my reading was 5.6 this morning mean that it is a good thing?",
(with regard to the intolerance test).,
"i'm going to start really cutting down on things and i've managed to change my diet for the better recently by eating wholegrain based breakfasts (wheatabix etc), having a bowl of salad or tin of soup with some brown bread for lunch and having some pasta and dolmio low fat pasta sauce for my evening meal etc.",
i need to get the chocolate/sugar intake down and i've just obtained a new bike so that i can go out cycling a couple evenings each week.,
i do play football twice a week for at least an hour at a time and because it's 5 a side i end up running around to a very high intensity most of the time.,
"thanks so much for the advice, it is very much appreciated andyjmortimer said: 5.6 is the value shown on all test-kit packaging - because it's near perfect.",
don't fuss with it.,
4 to 7 is fine.,
"i sometimes have values in the 20s, and i'm sure others do too.",
i'm pleased if i'm near 10 or so.,
click to expand... is that the near perfect scores for non diabetics?,
i only ask because i wasn't sure if you are aware that i'm not classed as diabetic at present,
i am a social smoker nowadays and my mum has just called me to say that cigarettes contain sugar !!!,
did anyone else already know this ?,
"trying my best to give up completely but i find if i meet up with anyone who smokes, i have one too :-( mh2010 said: i have smoked for years and have never heard this before.",
click to expand...,
i have looked on the web and apparently it is used in the tip so that the tobacco is not bitter !,
wurst said: there is no sugar in cigarettes but the chemicals and /or nicotine can raise blood sugars.,
i smoked for a period after diagnosis and my bs was uncontrollable.,
click to expand... why does it say that there is sugar in the tip to prevent bitterness on the web and where did you find out that there was no sugar.,
"thanks, julie",
does anyone know if i can access historical test results online?,
id like to look at the history of my hba1c and lipids tests.,
"i use emis to book appointments, but it doesnt seem to have test rulers on there.",
"wow, thanks for the replies!",
ill give my gp surgery a call on monday to see if they can give me the extra access level.,
i was arrested 17 days ago for drunken disorderly....yes i had been drinking....but arrested because i wouldn't leave durham town center without my friend who i'd lost and was staying at my house and didn't have a key.,
"i was locked in a cell after having all of my belongings taken from me including my dextrose, i turned into a woman possessed kicking on the door and screaming for my dextrose.",
at 4.30am i had a doctor visit my cell.,
my blood sugar was 21...i'd been to a 'banquet' so took my novorapid at about 9.30 and didn't take my lantus with me 'cos i was taking that when i got home about 1am.,
"they took my keys and went to my house to get my lantus and demanded that i took it..i refused 'cos if i had, i'd have ended up in a coma without my dextrose, i was taken to a and e and released on bail.",
i've made a formal complaint to the police and still being 'fobbed' off by them not returning my phone calls.,
"luckily, i've been diabetic for type 1 for 17 yrs so knew what i was doing or i would've ended up in a coma!!!",
"i was released on bail and fined 80 and not charged, ie, no criminal record or dna taken.",
"do they think that that will make me think, ok, i got off with it?",
"i'll think myself lucky and forget about it...no, i'm not gonna let this lie.",
i'm currently waiting for a call from an inspector this evening that hasn't yet arrived.,
what do i do now?,
go the papers or t.v.,
and tell them to show their cctv to prove my point?,
"(ps, i also told them i was on medication for epilepsy, high blood pressure, underactive thyroid and pyrisis xx s10vsb i'm editing this for an update...... had my meeting with the sergeant yesterday.",
he agreed i should've been allowed a phone call and things could've been handled differently as i was not abusive or aggressive to the police at any time.,
he has seen all of the cctv footage and my complaint about my treatment in custody by one of the officers when i was like 'a woman possessed' in the cell has been taken seriously and they are getting a warning and their conduct will now be monitered.,
we spent over half an hour discussing diabetes.,
"he now knows why we take insulin, what a hypo and hyper is and what causes them, some of the symptoms, (as we are all different) and how they can be resolved by either insulin or sugar.",
he completely understands why i reacted like i did in the cell without knowing what my bs was or have access to dextrose or insulin and why i refused to take my insulin as they wouldn't tell me how long i would be detained for and could potentially had a hypo.,
i showed him my 'optimum xceed' and the users guide and how just 2 spots of blood from the finger can determine a hypo and keytones that could both potentially lead to death if not treated.,
i showed him the web page and they cost 15 but are free to diabetics on prescription.,
he wrote the web site down and is going to take if further because he agrees that diabetics should have better treatment in custody and a monitor is all it takes.,
he's going to speak to his superiors about it and get the ball rolling!!,
result!!!,
":thumbup: i said he might even get the monitors free because at the end of the day, they are for use by diabetics after all.",
when he was leaving i said i'm gonna fight this all the way and if they don't get monitors i would like a meeting with the chief inspector for him to justify why.,
"i also said that as durham was one of the top 3 police forces in england, if they got monitors and went on 'look north' news to say why they now have them due to the amount of wasted time and money by just getting drs to take bs alone and the stress caused to diabetics in custody, it might even start the ball rolling for the rest of the uk to follow.",
"btw...i also told him if they didn't get monitors, i would pay the 15 myself and come to the police station and show them how to use it.",

i often have yeasty smelling urine - is this a glucose smell?,
i've read several different answers on google - some say it's a sign of diabetes and some say a yeast infection.,
cheers ailz,
is there a link between receiving a greater number of insect bites with type2 diabetes than normal blood glucose levels.,
i ask this question as i seem to be more susceptible to bites now than before i was diagnosed.,
in particular mosquito bites.,
also concerned on having to many sores produced by these bites.,
are there any specific risks for someone with diabetes.,
hence i never go anywhere without a good supply of deet.,
"anyone else help, experience similar problems.",
thanks guys.,
lots of good info there.,
going to look into the garlic think..if works could be a good quick fix as i love italian.,
if it works on vampires may work on vampring insects as well..,
any advice?,
:?,
: tried metformin - became very tired like before and appeared to start episodes of regular dizziness...told doctor so put on metformin slow release...no changes to above so off that now..but nothing given..blood sugars still reading between 21 mmol and tonight 27 mmol.,
"i am watching my carb intake now and read the nutritional information but still really concerned about the effects i am living with: continous thirst, very dry mouth with strange metallic taste or sensation which i think is due to dry mouth,headache and blurred vision, confusion and excessively sleeping, ie: kids at school no energy to do anything today, for example, slept from moment i had arrived home from school drop to when i had to get them.",
i can't live like this anymore...,
anyone offer help on what to do next?,
angieg said: have you contacted your doctor and told him what your levels are running at?,
they are too high and you need some treatment if the metformin isn't helping.,
maybe gliclacide could help you but your doctor must decide if its appropriate.,
contact someone for an appointment or advice as soon as you can.,
"angie click to expand... hi angie, thanks for your reply.",
i had a call from the surgery this morning and i am to go in on wednesday for an appointment with the diabetic nurse first and then my gp.,
i really do like my gp though and she didn't want to put me on anything else as i am a little on the fuller figure size apparently some of the diabetic medicines are prone to weight gain.,
"maybe gliclacide is one of those, but i must admit i don't know.",
"anyway thanks again for your advice chrissieworne said: hi gingercat, sorry to hear about your probs, just a thought on the metformin.",
"i had been prescribed ""metformin"" sr by gp and for several months my pharmacist gave me bolymin, i got on fine with that, however, 2 prescriptions ago he suddenly changed it to giving me metformin, the brand and i had tummy probs but persevered, my last prescription he again changed it to metabet and i was so ill.",
"i asked him why i had been given 2 different forms of metformin recently and he more or less said hard luck it's the cheapest version of met and it's all the same anyway, well, obviously it's not.when i compared the leaflet this dreadful version (in my opinion) of met has 9, yes, 9 other ingredients including talc as well as the metformin in it.",
i created a fuss with my gp and i told him it's not fair to play these financial games with patients who think all forms of met are the same and obviously are not.,
he looked up prices in book and said metabet is by far the cheapest form of met therefore giving pharmacist more damn profit.,
he said obviously the way this is made upsets me seriously but that if a gp prescribes met a pharmicist can give any form of it they choose.,
he has now changed my repeat prescription stating i must have bolymin.,
i know this doesn't suit everyone but am wondering if a different form of it may suit you better?,
"take care chrissie click to expand... hi chrissie, your experience is terrible and disgusting.",
i mean 'talc'- i don't blame you for being angry i would too :evil: i know my gp prescribed codeine phosphate for me and the pharmacist gave me dihydrocodeine.,
i think they are the same but it annoyed me anyway as it was different to the usual box.,
"i am seeing my gp on wed, hopefully she will give me something else :wink: i have never heard of bolymin but i may look it up :mrgreen: hlw said: your doctor knows you have diabetes and need treatment, but has told you to stop taking metformin, and has not prescribed anything else instead?",
sounds like you need to make a formal complaint to whoever you need to complain to about gps.,
"there are many other types of tablet available for type 2 diabetes, a couple of different injectable treatments, and if none of those work (which i think is unlikely unless of course you have type 1 instead) there is insulin.",
"so don't worry if metformin doesn't work, there are alternatives.",
"with levels like yours, you need to check for ketones - do you have urine test strips for ketones?",
"get an emergency appointment with a gp tomorrow, to try something other than metformin.",
"click to expand... hi hlw, thanks for your advice.",
i do have an appointment on wednesday with both the diabetic nurse and my gp.,
"i have been told it is t2 and as far as i am aware, i have had symptoms similar to diabetes for years now..but i have only recently recalled that.",
"a nurse at a previous practice noticed i had some red blotchy spots all over my arms (they continue to spread now - recently to my face) and tested me for diabetes there and then with a blood test, but nothing came of it.",
:?,
": i do have test strips but not done so recently..but will do i think, thanks again.",
daibell said: you are having all of the symptoms i had when first diagnosed but fortunately metformin sr does not cause me any problems.,
i have found that none of the tablets i'm on e.g.,
"metformin & gliclazide have a great effect on by bg, but how i handle food and exercise does.",
do keep the carbs low and low gi; spread them out during the day.,
do have plenty of exercise if you can; this really drives my bg down.,
as others have said it's now up to your gp to offer alternative treatments.,
good luck.,
"click to expand... hi daibell, thanks for your reply.",
i have recently started monitoring the carb situation.,
i do have a limited diet anyway and the fact that i do not eat meat or fish limits it still.,
"to be fair to my gp, she has already threaten that she will admit me to hospital if i keep pushing it..but i think she knows she can't.",
or that i will keel over and then i won't be able to argue with anyone she told me recently.,
"to be honest to myself, i am slowly getting worse.",
i am finding it more and more of a struggle now to do things.,
"anyway, thanks again.",
:?,
thanks everyone for your replies.,
"i have used test strips and they do show ++++ for glucose (which is normal for me), but what i haven't before are +for bilrubin and + for leucocytes (i have had trace to + for white blood cells).",
but not sure what the significance of bilrubin is?,
"so if anyone can, please let me know.",
thanksxx :| thanks sid and jane for your replies.,
jane - i didn't realise that about metformin and the other anti-diabetics drugs.,
sid- i must admit i am getting weaker and more confused!,
"so i will see what happens on wed. today, for instance, my bg was 21.1 and after a light lunch, i know it will be higher when i test later.",
thanks again why is your pharmacist not honouring the prescription?,
this is a crazy situation and a terrible one for you.,
i was always under the impression that the doctor was the prescriber..perhaps i was wrong :?,
": i was given omeprazole by my gp because i am on a mixture a drugs for other conditions: epilim chromo for migraine prevention, citralopram for depression, codeine phosphate for mobility problems as well as inhalers: both prevention and relief inhalers.",
she thought all of those would contraindicate each other!,
"but as soon as i took the omeprazole i was sick with indigestion all night , and strange headaches on one side of my head.",
i haven't taken another one since..and i told my gp what it did.,
today i visited both my diabetic nurse and gp.,
my diabetic nurse had a good chat and 'presuaded' me to try the metformin again as the effect it had on me would settle down.,
"well, i feel so ill now, my bg is still in the twenties, i feel like i could fall asleep where i stand or sit, constant thirst and very sore mouth.",
so i agreed.,
well .,
tonight was first night taking the slow release one and i have to say it is already causing upset!,
so thank you to those who kindly advised me last week when i started this thread.,
i was certainly in a state of high anxiety.,
"but it isn't fair when you have to not only deal with diabetes but the drugs that are meant to help you, actually end up making you feel worse.",
hope you are feeling better soon chrissie and i would definately tell my gp if my pharmacist was doing something different.,
"i know pharmacists know alot and their training is to a high medical standard, but i am an old-fashioned girl who would rather develop a mutual patient-doctor relationship and trust what my gp says over my local pharmacist, as nice and as friendly as my local one is!",
"hey chrissie, i would be interested in knowing how you get on, good luck.",
":wink: i will also be back to this thread to let you know how my trial on metformin, part ll goes.",
:mrgreen:,
"hi all, i'm here for my partner, for whom i am the carer.",
"he has pernicious anaemia, hashimoto's disease and recent diagnosis of diabetes 2 (the latter which he has been dodging for years as a prediabetic).",
he is currently recording (for the first time) his blood glucose before and after meals.,
we are still trying to bring down the levels through diet and exercise before we next see the gp or endocrinologist.,
"i have noticed that, while he tends to have a relatively high baseline - in the high 6s and 7s, sometimes 8 or 9, his blood glucose does not rise more than a couple of points after meals.",
"he has been walking before breakfast and whenever his sugar levels are high, with moderate results.",
"i have just realised that he is quite constipated and have found out the relationship between constipation and diabetes - where fluid is retained to dilute blood sugar levels and thus taken from the bowel, causing constipation, but also, that slow processing of food can increase the blood sugar levels.",
"i have been giving him actulose (lactulose) daily for two days without results, and have told him to take it three times a day.",
"i gather, however, that lactulose isn't the laxative of choice in diabetes.",
what do others think and do in this situation?,
the problem has persisted over several days and i think has been a feature for months at least.,
"it is only recently, however, that i have learned that it could be associated with the body's attempts to reduce blood sugar levels.",
"since lactulose causes diversion of fluid back to the gut, i thought it would be a good counter to diabetes trend to retain fluid to dilute blood glucose.",
thanks but lactulose is indicated for constipation.,
it takes a while to work and is not addictive.,
"a strangely little known fact is that it is also brilliant for liver failure in that it restores gut bacteria and reins in overgrowths of a gut bacteria that produce ammonia and cause encephalitis, in liver failure.",
i'm thinking that maybe my question has too many parts.,
i will repost the part about the baseline blood glucose levels.,
"my partner can go to bed hours after a meal with a blood sugar of, say 6.2, but wake up with a blood sugar of 9.",
"most of the time, before meals, his blood sugars are between 6 and 7.",
"then, after a meal they are not much different.",
(we eat almost no carbs).,
so i guess my question arises from the fact that he has highish pre-food glucose that does not seem to be much affected by his meals.,
or exercise.,
which is one of the reasons i started looking at the constipation as a variation.,
thanks for reading.,
"hi, my wife has type 1 diabetes - two insulin injections a day - and has always used savlon liquid antiseptic to sterilise her injection sites.",
now we can't find it in any local stores or on-line.,
has it been discontinued?,
"my wife has used this for many, many years - apparently there is no ""disinfectant smell"" - and is very upset at its disappearance.",
what methods do other people with type 1 to sterilise their injection sites?,
many thanks.,
many thanks for everyone's contribution.,
today i met up with a friend who (it turns out) is t2.,
"however, despite being on met and glic she never tests because her gp has never suggested it, doesn't even have a kit.",
i have a spare kit in the car so she asked if she could use it... we did and she returned a 17.6.,
thinking this might be an issue with the kit or strips i tested myself and it was what i expected.,
i told my friend she should probably go see her doctor but she reckons she feels great.,
when i was up in that range i felt lousy and i guess i'm feeling scared for her as i have no idea how long she has been at that level.,
to those people who visit those dizzying heights or have recently come down from there... do you have no tangible symptoms?,
xfieldok said: i was at those levels at dx.,
i was tired and used to fall asleep after eating.,
i thought i was ok until i got my levels down and realised i felt a whole lot better.,
"click to expand... that's how i was, but she claims she is on top of the world.",
thanks for the reply.,
"guzzler said: i didn't start testing until a few weeks after diagnosis with an a1c of 98 (don't know how that would equate to daily average readings) but i felt no symptoms apart from freezing cold feet which i had put down to getting older and which disappeared (the cold feeling, not my feet!)",
once my levels came down.,
it just proves how individuals can differ.,
"i think you are right to be concerned about your freind, how about suggesting that she may be able to lower her dosages or even come off the drugs, an awful lot of people dislike taking any kind of medication, it's worth a shot.",
"suggest she joins this forum, too.",
good luck.,
click to expand...,
"i mentioned to her about lchf and this site, and i shall point out that coming off her meds eventually would be a win.",
it is fascinating that some people can handle consistently high bg levels.,
"thanks for the reply, i'm glad your feet didn't disappear thank you all for your input, hopefully my concerns are enough to get her to see her gp.",
"at least i feel better informed should she want to discuss it further, although i will keep pointing her here to this site as i'm still a newb to it all.",
cheers,
it is blatently obvious that the nhs guidelines are so wrong for diabetics.,
and probably for people in general.,
but specifically for us.,
as diabetics we are carbohydrate intolerant so we have to keep carbs much lower than people who aren't.,
there seems to be an under lying reason that we aren't given proper advice and we are offered medication and not adviced to check blood sugars with a meter.,
drs get paid more for patients on diabetes meds i believe (and even more when statins are perscribed).,
pharma companies are also quids in as are diabetes organisations.,
poor dietary advice keeps people sick and results in them needing more meds.,
does anyone know whether the eatwell guidelines have ever been challenged.,
for example via change.org?,
kokhongw said: who benefits if hundreds of millions of t2d managed to reverse their condition and becomes medication free within a year or so?,
click to expand...,
thank you for sharing this very interesting article.,
"nocrbs4me said: to be fair, virtually nobody follows the government dietary guidelines.",
they are difficult to adhere to even if you really try to.,
click to expand...,
completely agree.,
ive never questioned them before.,
that said i've never followed instructions like the 5 a day rubbish!,
kokhongw said: it is a systemic problem that will be difficult to dislodged.,
"big food and pharma are too deeply entrenched in the system and profits globally from the current model of ""healthcare"".",
changes will only come if there is an alternative model that actually gets rewarded for healthy outcomes and not sickness... click to expand...,
the healthier model has to be lchf surely.,
the results are phenominal.,
i now have a non diabetic hba1c due to this diet and i am one of many.,
it would help with not only diabetes but problems with obesity which is also on the rise.,
"guzzler said: it is proving to be akin to fighting medusa with no more than a butter knife and a coat hanger but there are a growing number of people in the medical profession challenging the dogma, calling for full disclosure and clarity within and without the system.",
it seems that there needs to be a generational change as well as an educational one.,
click to expand... you can't eat an elephant whole!,
it's going to take time.,
it's just getting the word to spread faster!!!,
kokhongw said: who benefits if hundreds of millions of t2d managed to reverse their condition and becomes medication free within a year or so?,
click to expand... what a wonderful thought.,
kokhongw said: if there is now a massive drop in t2d patients...it would likely be followed with a correspondingly massive drop in nhs funding...the same goes for most government health agencies around the world...,
in reality only the health insurers may stand to gain from the public's improved health...depending on how their cost is structured... click to expand...,
if there was a massive drop in t2d pts then the nhs (and other worldwide health organisations) would not need to give so much funding.,
the most important people who would gain are the diabetics themselves.,
hallo can someone advise if there are any long term adverse effects of using metformin.,
"i was prescribed 1500mg of the medication as soon as i was diagosed last august and, in combination with some drastic diet and lifestyle changes, it has helped me to quickly bring my diabetes under control, as summarised in the info given with my signature below.",
my current fasting blood glucose level is around 5 mmol.,
current readings taken 2 hours after a meal very rarely rise above 6 mmol.,
this is on a daily intake of about 150 - 180g of carbohydrate.,
the reason i am asking is that i am about to see my endoctrinologist next week and would like to discuss with him the possibility of decreasing the dosage of metformin.,
"although i could reduce my carbohydrate intake slightly, if at all possible, i would prefer not to do it as i am happy with my current diet (i am losing weight and in addition to controlling glucose levels,my lipid problem is greatly improved) and feel that it is one i could happily maintain for the long term.",
.....,
"but it does mean that i stay on the medication, hence my question.",
"at the moment, other than the general feeling/awareness that all medication has some unwanted side effects, i am not aware of any specific reason why i should try to get off/ reduce the metformin.",
does using oral medication mean that your diabetes will progress to insulin dependence faster than with diet alone?,
any other known adverse consequences of the specific medication?,
i do not suffer from upset stomach and show no symptoms of acidosis.,
"please treat this as a request for specific information and not as an invitation for more general debate on the subject of ""to low carb or not"", which although very interesting is in my opinion covered extensively in a number of other posts.",
"at any rate, i fully respect both approaches if they lead to the desired effect.",
thank you regards pavlos,
"hello, i found out 5 weeks ago that my blood sugar was high (fasting 7.6 hba1c 6.6) but as i was also suffering a liver infection at the time my gp said to repeat the bloods in 3 months.",
well i ignored him and got a monitor as i was feeling so scared and decided to completely change everything about my diet.,
i started on a low carb low calorie diet straight away and have lost 10kg in 5 weeks.,
but my bg still isint coming down and is now going up ( 9.2 my highest reading) and this is worrying me.,
how long does it take to lower blood sugar by diet alone for other people?,
do i need to get back to the gp and push for meds?,
i want to take control of this so any advice would be appreciated thank you.,
thank you.,
i am trying so hard but was starting to loose hope that it was working despite the weight loss so i will just keep up the battle!,
thank you.,
"i am working on how to get some excersize as walking along with every other ""normal"" excersize is not possible due to another condition i have (only bits of me actually work lol) which is so frustrating!",
i'm also in the middle of a very complicated highly stressful situation so really not doing myself any favours here!,
i will just keep battling as i have done and won't beat myself up if the results dont happen as quickly as i would like.,
"completely low carb, low calorie, no starches, sugars, processed food at all.",
almost all my meals are leafy greens.,
"due to another medical condition large food groups are out for me, red meat, anything from the sea, fruit, soya, eggs, so with taking out carbs as well that doesn't leave to much but i'm managing it okay at the moment.",
i'm not on any meds as gp.,
how carb heavy is a kebab?,
"i had a mixed kebab with salad last night and 5 hours later, feeling really **** i tested for a hypo and was shocked to see a reading of 8.6.",
this was after my usual after dinner walk with the dog.,
i was surprised to see such a high reading - the highest i've seen for a long time.,
someone my friend knows was telling him about her type 1 diabetes and she said she's learnt to carb count and she's been told she can eat and drink anything she wants as long as she takes the right amount of insulin.,
so she will just drink full fat fizzy pop like pepsi and coca cola 24/7.,
surely that's harmful and she's been told wrong info?,
"just how did you find out you had diabetes, i am sure there are many interesting stories out there that could help others!!",
myself i had to go to see a specialist as was putting on weight every time they cut my thyroxine down i said to the doc look this is not right something is wrong...went to see the specialist had blood tests and they said all seemed alright....weeks later i rang my doc to say look i got an incurable thirst and made an appointment she asked what i had had to eat and drink at the hospital where i attended to see the specialist i said nothing just a coffee and no sugar as always used sweetners she saidd well ur sugar level was high ;like 10 i said well why they say all seems fine???,
they did a blood test and a week later i got a phone call from the doc saying can you get to the surgery i need see you immediatly as your sugar levels are realy high i said how high she wouldn't say till i got there and said they was 28...was started on metformin x 2 twice a day and go to see the nurse every 3 months for blood tests..but i mean to say why they dont do these tests when you complain you are not right.... oh that was quick for you....i was over weight too but thankfully have lost it all...good idea to have an annual health check then,
why is it such bad news to find ketones in your urine?,
"silly question perhaps, but this is all new information to me!",
"aaaah so it's not the ketones by themselves that are the problem - but when high and combined with high bg, it's a different story.",
thank you!,
thank you - it sounds awful.,

"this is a direct result of the diabetes apparently, no matter that im quite well controlled!",

i am wondering about menopausal symptoms and diabetes/blood sugar levels.,
"before i was diagnosed i suffered dreadfully with hot flushes every 10 minutes or so during the day, and waking me up in the night.",
"in the past few months, with the low-ish carbing (about 80g a day) they have almost stopped.",
co-incidence?,
"i should mention that i have only recently become menopausal, in the last year, so its not been long.",
"am i right in thinking that insulin affects hormones, or is a hormone?",
i tried progesterone therapy for a few years due to horrendous pmt in my 30's.,
"but it made me worse and, while we are on this subject, i had got my first period for 10 months.",
i thought periods just stopped?,
i am 50. any good book recommendations?,
maybe i should find out more about this change.,
"your gp may not explain it that way click to expand... my gp has said sweet nothing about it, ever.",
i asked her about the hot flushes a few months before diagnosis for diabetes.,
"the whole conversation, ever, about menopause: me: i keep going hot and then very cold for no reason.",
"doctor: probably your age, how old are you?",
"me: just turned 50 doctor: are you still having periods me: well, i havent had one this month (this was in feb) doctor: well, you are either pregnant, or its the menopause.",
me: should i have my hormone levels tested?,
"doctor: no point, at your age.",
"you are probably menopausal and there is nothing we can do about that, so lets not bother.",
end of conversation.,
"at that stage, as those on here can tell you, i was far more of a doormat than i am now.",
why would i need/want a hysterectomy?,
"as i said, low-carbing seems to have stopped my hot flushes.",
"hi, i'd welcome any advice about joint and muscle pain.",
"i take simvastatin and to 'counter' the effects i take co-enzyme q10, alpha-lipoic acid, fish oils and herbal joint pain tablets.",
my last hba1c was 6.8.i take lantus and oral medications.,
"i have been prone to fibromyalgia, from before i was diabetic, but find now at 57 that i get days where the pain in my muscles and joints is really disabling.",
"the doctor says there's ""really nothing"" he can do because of my other medication.",
"i've already changed my cholesterol medication previously but wonder if i should change to something else to ease the pain which is causing me dreadful problems, particularly at night.",
any advice would be really welcome.,
thank you.,
"hi, my doctor says anything under 7 is normal.",
the mayo clinic states that anything over 100 up to 125 is prediabetic.,

my fasting blood glucose was 7.2 this morning.,
please can you give me the correct information so i can protect my health.,

2 questions: 1) does anyone know why high sugars would cause sore throats?,

"i posted a query on the diabetes uk type 1 forum in july asking for advice about the danger of short term high blood sugar levels (9 to 16 mmol), as i understood from my diabetes nurse that such levels in the short term of hours and even days were not dangerous, but were, of course, if they carried on for weeks and months.",
"other type 1s i had spoken to said this was not the case, and even very short term high levels, if occurring often , would cause big problems eventually to diabetics.",

"hello everyone, the title of my thread may be slightly strange however ive been having issues for about 12 months now.",
"to cut a long story short, i keep feeling like ive got low blood sugar.",
ive got a blood glucose tester and when i test myself generally im between 5 and 6mmol.,
the symptoms i get which seems to be on a daily basis are the following.,
- 99% of the time i wake up in a morning feeling sick - palpitations - shakes - weak \ fatigue - dizzy / nauseas what i do know is if i eat i generally start to feel better.,
"sometimes i can be ok for a whole day, other times it can come back quickly.",
"ive had lots of tests this past year at my gp including hba1c, full blood count, 24 hour ecg, 24 hour blood pressure.",
all apparently have come back ok. my next test is at the endocrinology department this week for a short synachthen test to see if my adrenal function is working as normal.,
#NAME?,
from the day this started ive always thought im firefighting diabetes - although my gp thinks its nothing related and that it could be stress which i dont think it is.,
my blood sugar is never above 8 really (only after a big meal) and generally it doesnt drop below 5.,
although i have dropped to 3.4 a few times before.,
anyway i believe i might be in the right place at the endocrinologist department (they generally diagnose diabetes and treat if im correct?),
if someone could help or provide any info that can help me i would be grateful.,
does this sound like it could be linked to diabetes?,
i dont know what else to do.,
thanks thank you and apologies if this in the wrong section.,
i am headed to the ends clinic thursday so have my first consultation.,
im basically going to give him everything.,
the entire journey ive been on so far and how horrid its been.,
previously i was a fit healthy adult in my 20s.,
before this i used to be very active.,
"running 20 miles a week, football 3 times a week, gym etc as well as bringing up three children.",
whatever it is its ruining my life.,
"hi there, i signed up to the forum after doing some interesting reading on other people's posts here and was hoping for advice.",
"i am not diagnosed as diabetic, but i decided to do some home blood glucose tests (due to symptoms) and got readings over 10!",
i would really appreciate some insight on whether this is dangerous.,
i am also seeking advice from my doctor.,
on all tests i ate one meal and drank nothing other than tea without sugar during testing.,
did not exercise during test.,
washed hands and dried with disposable kitchen roll for every single test to get accurate results.,
my bmi is 15.5 (underweight).,
friday 29th may: 6.00am: fasting bg = 5.0 6.15am: ate my normal breakfast (2 x whole grain toast with spread and fortisip high calorie drink - total 560 kcal).,

background; i am a 23 year old female.,
"i have had a lifelong anxiety disorder treated by antidepressants, but no other diagnosed health conditions.",
i have been having very strange symptoms for the past year which seem to have suddenly increased in intensity over the past month.,
"particularly, i am always exhausted with headaches and have experienced near-collapse when i try to walk around.",
"i almost called 999 on several occasions, but i felt too terrible to make the decision so generally sat on the floor for hours until i felt better.",
"i was always underweight my entire life, but have lost weight despite eating more food plus taking prescribed fortisip (high calorie food replacement).",
now my bmi is at 15.5.,
my gp sent me for an ecg which showed an abnormal heart rhythm so i am being referred to a cardiologist in mid-june.,
"i feel this is a ""red herring"" given my blood sugar tests.",
should i take these results to my gp or will she laugh at me?!,
"any thoughts, advice or insights would be greatly appreciated.",
"mike d said: in my opinion, yes you should.",
can't say i'm crazy about the diet (rice and bread) and those spikes but that runs a distant second to your other concerns.,
"please have a consult and i wish you well mike click to expand... hi mike, thank you for your fast response.",
i was worried my gp would dismiss me and make me feel embarrassed for having done experiments on myself.,
"i never eat plain rice normally , i just did this as a test.",
"kateincornwall said: hello and welcome , i notice that your fasting tests are giving good results .",
"however , most meals are carb heavy and this will definitely impact on your post meal results .",
many people who are either pre diabetic or diagnosed type 2 chose to adopt a lower cab regime which definitely improves the bs content .,
"i can tell that you are very anxious about your health , so yes, ask your doctors advice on what you have written here , only then can you move forward .",
"i am sorry to read about your heart problems , hoping you can find some solace when you see the cardiologist this month .",
click to expand... you are right in saying i'm very anxious about my health.,
"my gp put it all down to my weight, and suspected me of not eating properly, but this is a total fiction...",
i eat the same types and amount of food as my partner (who is twice my weight!),
i also read fasting readings are high for diabetics so this made me think i was paranoid...,
"but on the other hand, i also read that blood glucose in normal people doesn't go above 7.8 ever.",
i am not sure whether this is true in reality?,
"i was also under the impression that it is not possible to get type 2 diabetes if you are underweight (although i understand you can get it at a healthy weight, e.g bmi 18 - 25.",
my bmi has never been near 18 throughout my lifetime.,
"kateincornwall said: blood glucose levels in non diabetic people can sometimes go high just the same as it can also go low , its the consistency that tends to point to a diagnosis, so please let your doctor decide for you .",
"it is a sad fallacy that weight always has a bearing on type2 , it can strike anyone, no matter what their weight is , especially if it runs in the family , but anyone can develop it , whatever their weight or build .",
click to expand...,
thank you.,
"as everyone has said i can show these results to my doctor, i feel much more confident in bringing them to her.",
it would be very embarrassing if it was no cause of concern whatsoever.,
"i haven't tested my blood sugar before these experiments so i didn't know what it was ""supposed"" to be like!",
"deejayr said: hiya, and welcome.",
"good advice from everyone, but i can't see beyond your bmi.",
i would have thought it must affect everything else.,
maybe we should be focusing on that.,
click to expand... you may be right!,
but the annoying thing is that i've tried to gain weight to no effect.,
"i estimate i eat about 2,5000 calories a day, sometimes much more calories if i eat a heap of cake (which my partner gets free from work).",
"my highest (lifetime) bmi has been about 17 - it's typically in the 16 - 17 range, but this is a ""new low"", so to speak.",
i will post again after discussing my results with my doctor.,
it might be useful for anyone else that comes across this post if they are having similar issues.,
i do look noticeably emaciated and unwell recently.,
very visible sternum bones on my chest and my spine and hip bones and ribs are all easily seen too.,
"i look like a skeleton, such that sitting down is painful because of a ""lack of padding"".",
my mother (who i hadn't seen for some months) said i look gaunt like a meth addict.,
i've never touched it!,
"boojewels said: good luck, please keep us posted.",
"click to expand... will do, thank you!",
"hi , i am newley diagnosised with type 2 and wonderd if anyone could tell me when you are allowed to get free perscriptions for your test strips and lancets.",
i asked for a blood monitor from my doctors and they gave me a freestyle monitor.,
but have just paid out for 3 perscriptions 1 for lancets 1 for test strips 1 for simvastatin tablets .,
simvastatin is for cholesterol.,
im just not sure if im allowed free perscriptions for my blood meter or not can anyone help please.,
when speaking to my pharmacy they said dont you get these free (totally lost} many thanks geoff re: free perscriptions many thanks for your help and funny enough just sorted the pre pay last night re: free perscriptions thanks viv and twinkle your both stars,
"hi fellow-diabetics, i've been diagnosed for 18 months, type 'one and a half'-- diabetes basically under control with glipizide, but i''ve been starting to have real problems with hypos.",
"hypo awareness is down a bit, but i do the recommended things to bring blood sugar levels back up to normal within 10 minutes or so.",
all my problems come after blood sugar has returned to normal.,
"i feel incredibly weak, dizzy, body feels very heavy and bruised, short of breath, waves of depression -- all i can do is to go to bed even if it's only mid-afternoon, and these effects now last for at least 24 hours, and every time it takes longer to get out of it.",
"plays havoc with work, deadlines, etc.",
and now my body is starting to simulate the attacks even with normal blood sugar level and without the hypo starting it all off.,
"all the books imply that getting out of a hypo is just like bouncing up again (unless the hypo is really severe, obviously).",
does anyone else out there experience these after-effects?,
me again.,
"i haven't done this before so don't know how long one is meant to wait for replies, but wanted to write to thank those who have replied already.",
sugar2 -- i'm really grateful for your suggestions.,
"i always take the same stuff for hypo -- 3-4 dextrose tablets, bit of flapjack, toast.",
"it would make sense that the problem might be a reaction to sugars going up too quickly, but these things used to work fine in the past, and 30 mins after hypo treatment i'm usually around 7.8/8.2 and similar the next morning.",
"my typical bg in the morning is low 7s, but my hba1c is 6.1.",
"the gp thinks i may be 'over-controlled', which doesn't seem fair!",
maybe you're right that this is more typical if one isn't a straight t1 or t2 --- there are an awful lot of us who don't fit (i'm 'suspected mody').,
microfazer -- thanks for this.,
i usually never go below about 3.5 even in a bad hypo.,
"i'm not on insulin yet, but am certainly trying to sort out alternative medication that wouldn't make me as prone to hypos.",
"gp suggests gliptins or glitazones, but each have side-effects, of course.",
hey ho... daisy3174 -- thanks so much for writing.,
so reassuring that i'm not alone.,
very sorry you're having such rotten times.,
i actually managed a slightly better hypo yesterday -- caught short in m&s (is there a thread on most embarrassing places to have hypos?,
"so far mine are performing in a live concert, and lecturing to 200 students..).",
i made it to the cafe.,
no dextrose so wolfed down jelly babies and flapjack and then forced myself to sit completely still and calm and do absolutely nothing.,
"incredibly boring, and still shaking and queasy after half an hour, but after an hour managed to ease myself around.",
"my tendency is always to try to fight it, or at least to do something while waiting for effects to wear off, even if it's just reading or listening to music.",
mabe this is part of the problem.,
it would be good to keep this thread running a while -- we can't be the only people where the '30 minutes max and then you feel fine' rule doesn't work.,
"many thanks to all who have contributed to this thread, especially andys and snodger.",
"from these and other conversations, especially with my wonderful diabetic nurse (who has a deeper understanding of diabetes than all the experts at the diabetes clinic) it seems clear that is not uncommon for people to have bad after-effects from hypos for up to 24 hours.",
"as youd expect, after-effects vary in individuals (ranging through splitting headaches, feeling severely hung-over, being sick, feeling very weak, etc).",
"having recurrences of these symptoms for several days afterwards but without further hypos and with normal bg readings seems to be less common, but effects seem to be alleviated by reducing dosage and letting bg readings rise to 8s and 9s (and in the end this will also enhance hypo awareness anyway, and thus help to stop the whole process getting started).",
"this will all seem very obvious to you diabetes veterans out there, but i do wish hypo after-effects were at least mentioned in books on diabetes.",
i will try to persuade diabetes.uk to insert a sentence or two on their website.,
"as for me, having stupidly congratulated myself on this thread for having mastered my latest hypo, all hell broke loose over the next few days.",
"constant attacks of severe weakness, dizziness, gasping for breath, couldnt manage a flight of stairs im (slim!)",
48 but felt like 88.,
"halving the medication seems to have helped, though difficult not to freak out at getting 9s and 10s at first.",
"i still take a positive view of it all im getting a very brief glimpse of how life is for someone with clinical depression, or an oap with emphysema, but i then have the incredible luxury of switching back to a normal(ish) life.",
in a way thats a privilege.,
but god i do miss chocolate....,
"hi, can anyone tell me if it's ok to drink grapefruit juice shortly after taking metformin.",
i have been doing this occasionally and found that my blood sugar goes up to higher than normal 2 hours later when doing glucose test.,
this was the only reason i could think of as to why my blood sugar was higher than normal after breakfast.,
i googled this and low and behold i have just read that you should not combine the two and i have also read that it does not matter.,
"suffice to say, i won't be combining them any more!",
i would also like to take apple cider vinegar every day.,
does anyone know if this affects metformin?,
cheers!,
"hi, thanks for your replies.",
i know about grapefruit juice and statins.,
thankfully i don't have to take statins.,
"grapefruit juice is often touted as an alternative to metformin, which may be one of the reasons why they should not be taken together.",
i had breakfast an hour ago and so far feel fine.,
"yesterday i had stomach ache all day, but my blood sugar did decline to usual levels after my nutriblast lunch.",
"sadly i cannot face eggs for breakfast and far prefer my usual oats, with some nuts, a few cacao nibs, pumpkin seeds, maca, kefir and a good sprinkle of cinnamon.",
in case anyone is interested this is one of the places where i found out about the grapefruit/metformin issue: http://drmicozzi.com/insiders-cures-subscribers/truth-about-metformin is anyone finding any benefit from apple cider vinegar?,
cheers!,
"#collieboy, well that explains it then.",
"today, i have had no stomach ache and my bs is down to normal 2 hours after breakfast.",
"yesterday, after grapefruit juice and breakfast and metformin, my bs was 3.5 mmol higher then at same time today.",
grapefruit juice does seem to be something of an enigma.,
"apparently fresh orange juice is not so bad - and lemon juice with water is supposed to be excellent for you, first thing in the morning.",
"hi im recently diagnosed as type 2, last blood test was 52mmols but i have always noticed a sweet taste in my mouth now and again is this normal ?????",

sent from the diabetes forum app no never even heard of them??????,
sent from the diabetes forum app yes im on metformin 3 times daily now 500mg but ive noticed this sweet taste for more than 10 years on an off.,
always thought i'd had to many brews.,
always had 2 sugars but now im havin only half a spoon.,
sent from the diabetes forum app an they still taste to sweet.,

why is it that lancets also have an expiry date?,
"surely, if not used before expiry date, nothing adverse could possibly result?",
right now i am using expired lancets from a box i happen to find lying around?,
i am able to obtain a blood sample and i cannot feel that there is anything wrong with the lancets.,
it really eludes logical comprehension that manufacturers stipulate an expiry date?,
but is there a justifiable reason not to use expired lancets?,
"hi, i'm looking for some advice on ketones.",
i have a little boy (2 1/2) who has just been diagnosed with glucose intolerance or pre-diabetes as one consultant called it.,
"we are to keep check on him, regularly checking his urine for ketones and a 3montly doc app for full bloods etc.",
"but when i tested his ketones, using urine strips, it was with my reckoning at 3mmol.",
when i tested myself and my t1 husband we were at 0.,
what is normal level?,
i'm aware that ketones in urine lag the blood level.,
also a bit about ketosis and ketoacidosis.,
i dont particularly want to check my little ones bs as he doesnt like it after a recent trip to the hosp and a bad experience there.,
i'm thinking that i will keep a check of his urine over the next day or 2 to see what it ranges at.,
"he is well, although not himself either.",
he is drinking alot and going to the toilet alot but we were told these are signs of the pre-diabetes.,
he also eating much more than normal today if that is relevant.,
"sarah x hi and thankyou, i too didnt realise there was such a thing as a pre-diabetic!",
"i thought you either were or weren't but apparently not, esp in children, where there can be what the consultant called a honeymoon phase.",
stange if you ask me!,
"anyway, i have been watching him carefully over the last few hours and hes been going to the toilet alot and eating and drinking lots.",
i checked another urine sample and it was at a trace.,
"i did make him drink lots in the hope it would flush it out, as i know thats what my husband had been told to do when he was changeing insulin and had bother with ketones.",
what does fluctuating levels show?,
can it go up and down in a 'normal' person?,
i'm somewhat confused now!,
sarah p.s.,
"i didnt check his bg, but might try it when hes asleep.",
"p.p.s the hospital consultant said to take the bg of a non-diabetic child, even if considered at risk, is 'against his human rights', and should be left to the doc!",
needless to say i didnt respond nicely to that answer.,
"hi again, yes lilibet, i too thought pre-diabetic was in t2 adults showing very near diabetic levels.",
but my gp backed up what the older consultant said.,
"he calls it glucose intolerance, which he says is a more accepted term by newer qualified docs.",
he said its not seen everytime with children but he has seen it a few times before.,
"it was then he called it this honeymoon phase, where he said his pancreas is not fully functioning, or more likely that it isnt growing, and when he grows it will become more and more insufficent.",
"its quite a daunting thought to be honest, esp when they cant even agree on an answer amongst themselves.",
"when he falls asleep i'm going to do a test as when i asked if he wanted to test his sugar he went mad at the sight of the montior, telling me i was a bad mummy.",
"dont blame him really, i hate getting it too!",
yes the consultant and the human rights thing was totally off.,
she even said that my husband shouldn't be doing his insulin and blood check routine infront of the kids!,
i had a go at her about that one.,
she surely thinks shes a higher being than us mere mortals.,
s x just a quick update.,
"did his bg, it was at 9.",
"he did have a lolipop about an hour or so before that too, so could equate for the slighly higher than normal reading.",
but surely thats ok.,
yet another odd ball just to confuse me!,
thanx again guys x,
has anyone had problems with water retention in lower legs.,
"i've been on metformin for years, and after repeated stomach ache and the runs, went onto metformin slow release.",
"this has been fine for many years, and recently i seem to be having the runs again and stomach ache.",
"so, a couple of days ago, i stopped the metformin and i noticed a big improvement in my legs.",
"i get up in a morning and they look ""normal"", and at night, they are no where near as bad as before.",
"obviously, i'm just trying this for a few days, before i speak to my diabetes nurse.",
"so, has anyone else experienced this ?",
"contralto said: have the night edema, afraid to go off the metformin.",
"but on slow release, not having the stomach problems you are click to expand... just looking at my legs now.",
"massively better than 3 days ago, when at this time you could see they would be much bigger.",
"nothings really changed, apart from temporarily dropping the metformin.",
"i take insulin too, keeping the same amount on that.",
my body is weird lol.,
"i think it's time to ditch the forum, cos this has generated well over 200 comments on facebook.",
"and, i read comments from people who do think it caused edema.",
"plus, i'm going to the toilet more regular now, to pee, this is possibly due to my body working better to flush out the toxins and not retaining fluid in my legs ?",
phoenix55 said: if you are in the uk the recent heat may have had something to do with water retention in the legs.,
"i used to have it badly, to the point where i went to my then gp and saw him about it.",
"he checked half way up my 'calf', he told me i was too young to be put on drugs for water retention.",
"since then i have become borderline diabetic, refused metformin, reduced my carb intake, lost 2 stone in weight and i have retained my ankles through the heat with a 'normal' amount of swollen feet at the end of a long day on my feet.",

hi i have diabetes 2 taking three metformin tablets per day and for the last month taking one glipizide for the last month soon will be taking two tablets daily soon.,
i was wondering what alcohol i can take as i can't get in to speak to my doctor until early january.,
can i have a couple of pints of beer?,
re: mixing alcohol with metformin and glipicide just wanted to share that the diabetic nurse said it was okay for me to have a couple of drinks but not go mad.,
maybe this will be useful for someone else?,
hi everyone just wondered what other people do to dispose of pre-filled insulin pens.,
in the past james has always used cartridges which were easily put in the sharps box which we took to clinic for disposal.,
this is no longer allowed now and our sharps box is collected by the local council and a new one left .,
we were told by the dsn to dispose of them in the sharps box but the whole pens are taking up a lot of room.,
what do others do :?,
: thanks for all the replies.,
as i work for the local authority part-time i will check with the waste enforcement team when in work on wednesday and see if they can be recycled (empty of course) or just put in normal waste.,
thanks again everyone for input :wink:,
hi newly diagnosed as type 2 3 weeks ago.,
i have a testing machine just to use as info but not to take individual readings too seriously.,
so today i went to a board game cafe.,
had a panini (white) and sugar went to 13.3.,
then about 3/4 hour later i had a piece of lemon drizzle cake.,
have been told this is fine as long as not too much so had a smaller cake than other bits.,
i then took sugar about 2 hours after and it had reduced to 10.,
(something).,
like i said not worried as only for info but was just surprised that the cake didnt increase the blood sugar didnt instead it had decreased.,
any thoughts?,
xfieldok said: first thought is to tag @daisy1 for newbie welcome pack.,
you need to take your readings systematically and seriously.,
13 is very high.,
"you are newly diagnosed so your numbers are probably high, do you know what your hba1c number was?",
you should test before you eat and then 2 hours after the first bite.,
you are looking for a rise of no more than 2 between the two readings.,
click to expand...,
the doctor has said she only wants me using the tests for information out of interest not to do them too often etc.,
she is more interested in my next main test in november.,
hence why i dont test religiously etc.,
my first blood test was 87 i believe.,
littlegreycat said: was your first test 2 hours after the panini?,
"if not, you are not comparing like with like.",
possibly your insulin production ramped up slowly so you were high after the panini but then were better able to cope with the lemon drizzle cake.,
"whatever, 10 is a bit high.",
what was your bg level before you ate the panini?,
without that information we can't really comment much.,
for all we know your bg came down after the panini.,
click to expand... my first test of 13.3 was about 2 hours after the panini.,
the second test of 10 ish was after the cake.,
i expected the reading to go higher than the 13.3 due to cake being sugar.,
my levels will be higher as im newly diagnosed.,
only been on tablets successfully for 2 weeks.,
"xfieldok said: you need to make some lifestyle decisions, eating as you do, come november your numbers are going to be very, very high.",
most of us follow the low carb/high fat diet and most of us have been successful in reducing our numbers into the non or pre-diabetic range.,
read daisy1's post thoroughly.,
most of us test up to six or eight times a day.,
"keep a food diary along with your numbers, test before and after eating.",
this will show you what foods cause your bg to spike and so avoid them in the future.,
download the mysugr app to record these details.,
after a few days of entering data it will give you an estimated hba1c number.,
"briefly, lchf means, no bread (and no paninis), no rice, pasta.",
no cereals for breakfast.,
"avoid milk if you can, take double cream in coffee.",
"no sweets, cake, pastries etc.",
no fruit (except berries) no fruit juice.,
no cordials unless they are sugar free.,
read around the site.,
ask questions.,
"it is up to you to self manage your t2 diabetes, unfortunately doctors and nurses don't tell us this.",
click to expand...,
i havent been eating like this everyday.,
i was out there were limited food choices.,
the question is why lemon cake didnt increase the blood sugar.,
im being monitored by the diabetic team at my doctors and lifestyle changes are happening.,
i was puzzled and so asked the question thinking this was the place to do it.,
thanks for the advice guys.,

so the danger is if by testing im showing im low that there could be issues.,
"although when i did, i ate and retested to show it up again jokalsbeek said: i'm a t2, and i have had hypo's.",
"it's uncommon, if there are no hypo inducing meds, but not completely unheard of.",
i'm not sure whether a t2 has to legally tell the dvsa... others will know though.,
but they're hopefully having a lie in on this beautiful sunday morning.,
click to expand... you dont have to unless your meds cause hypos.,
hence why dr is keeping me off those meds.,
hi i'm type 2 and recently i have been suffering from a tight foreskin which will not pull back over the head.,
does anyone else suffer from this and if so how did u treat it,
"hi all, i have had type 1 diabetes for 22 years.",
my control was poor when i was a teenager but has been good since then (i am now 29).,
"blood pressure, cholesterol etc.",
are all normal.,
"anyway, i have not had a period since december.",
i have taken several pregnancy tests so can definitely rule that out.,
i went to the doctors in april and was told that they wouldn't usually investigate until i had missed five periods.,
"ridiculous, if you ask me!",
as i had only missed four back then i was sent away.,
"she did, however, mention that it was likely because of my diabetes.",
has anybody else heard or experienced anything like this?,
i'm struggling to understand how it could be diabetes-related given that my control is good.,
my bmi is 19 so within the normal range.,
"my iron levels are on the low end of normal, but still within the normal range.",
i'm due to go back to the doctors next week.,
i'm getting worried as to whether this could be a sign of fertility problems.,
i won't be fobbed off by the doctors this time.,
it's been six months now.,
i'd just be interested to hear if any of you have experienced anything like this or had any views on the situation.,
"many thanks in advance, em sent from the diabetes forum app thanks for the reply.",
i've been the same weight for years.,
"in fact, i've actually put on about half a stone since christmas.",
i'd be surprised if it was the weight but could definitely be an option.,
a few people have mentioned stress.,
the fact that my period doesn't come every month certainly adds to it!,
i'm not on any birth control.,
i came off that about four years ago.,
when i came off it i had continuous bleeding (light but still there) for close to five months.,
i was exhausted and fainting constantly.,
when the bleeding finally stopped i had three months without anything before my periods settled into a fairly regular routine.,
"don't get me wrong, it's quite nice not having the dreaded time of the month but it does worry me that something isn't right.",
i was diagnosed with mild pcos a few years back.,
i know that this can cause changes in cycle but it has never had much of an affect before.,
here's hoping the doctor has some answers!,
"em sent from the diabetes forum app hi all, thanks for the replies and sorry for the delay in responding.",
i saw my gp yesterday.,
he has referred me to the hospital for a once over.,
my period actually turned up over the weekend.,
it lasted a while day and a half and was then gone again.,
bizarre.,
"as i said in an earlier post, i do have mild pcos.",
i have out on about six pounds since christmas but the doctor didn't feel that this on its own should have made a huge difference.,
"nonetheless, i am getting my ovaries scanned to make sure.",
i spoke to my doctor about insulin resistance.,
"my insulin requirements are pretty low, largely because i don't eat many carbs.",
she suggested waiting until i had been to the hospital and then seeing where we are.,
"no periods for x months can definitely be a good thing, it just worries me that they have suddenly gone from being regular to being a bit haphazard.",
what's definitely not fun are the x week long bleeds that come every now and again!,
the gp was reluctant to talk about trying a new bc until i had my results back from the hospital.,
"anyway, at least things are moving in the right direction.",
i will hopefully get an appointment at the hospital soon and we can go from there.,
"thanks again for all your replies and support em x sent from the diabetes forum app hi tracey, i have mild pcos so they are going to check my ovaries to make sure that things haven't gotten worse since my last scan.",
my last scan wasn't that long ago but better to get things checked!,
my periods have always been very light (definitely a good thing).,
"recently, however, they have become much lighter and seem to turn up whenever they want.",
it's great in a way to not have anything for months on end.,
"on the other hand, you never know when the blasted thing is going to make its arrival!",
when it does arrive it might last one day or it might last several weeks.,
drives me mad!,
i've just had a phone call to confirm my appointment with the hospital for next week.,
glad i don't have to wait too long!,
sent from the diabetes forum app it's on the low end of normal but still within the normal range.,
at least they were at my last blood test two months ago.,
they are going to check them again when i go to the hospital next week though sent from the diabetes forum app,
this may seem trivial but does any one know whether alcohol free beers are ok?,
i am newly diagnosed and am on a low dosage of metformin this is despite some radical changes to life style including reduction in alcohol.,
"i have come across a no alcohol lager called bavaria, which contains mineral water, barley malt, wheat and hops it is very good but i do not want to risk any adverse effects on my diabetes however hot drinks and soda water are getting boring.",
wag,
is there a way to measure insulin at home?,
"that would be really interesting, rather than blood sugar or ketones.",
hi all i have recently started taking 2 tablespoons of ground flaxseed/linseed a day for my slow colonic transit disorder.,
"previously i took 15g of psyllium which worked ok but i think/hope flaxseed will be better, and it is easier to take.",
i assume it's not a good idea to take both at the same time.,
should i take more than 2 tablespoons a day?,
anyone who has used flaxseed for constipation or sct - how long did it take to work?,
it's hard for me to tell if it's working or not.,
"i am trying to be patient, and to drinks lots of water, which i'm not finding that easy.",
"thanks sweetlucie said: http://www.healthinfo.org.nz/patientinfo/lactulose.pdf if taken in responsible quantities, minimal farting will be the only side effect click to expand...",
"thanks, i've already tried lactulose.",
my gp says it doesn't do much for slow colonic transit.,
"ugh, this constipation is so annoying.",
it's morning here and i've been awake for 2 hours and still have zero appetite.,
i'm not going to eat a meal until my appetite improves.,
"i've had two cups of coffee and one of the boiled eggs i keep in the fridge, as i think my body should have some calories to work with.",
i hate eating when i don't feel like it.,
can anyone relate?,
sweetlucie said: did you ever eat beetroot to see how long your actual transit time is?,
colour indication showing switch from brown to purple.,
did you hear about transcutaneous electrical stimulation?,
there is something quite interesting which you could try with getting yourself a tens device for home use.. click to expand...,
"the beetroot test sounds interesting, lol.",
i've had an x-ray test done that involved swallowing a capsule with little pieces of plastic that show up on x-ray.,
that showed that the pieces took longer than normal to leave my system.,
way longer.,
the tens therapy sounds promising.,
i wonder where i could find out more about trying it.,
the machines are fairly cheap to buy but i'd want to make sure i was using the right kind of machine.,
i've been feeling worse each day since i started this thread.,
i'm going to skip the flaxseed for a day just in case it is actually causing blockages... probably due to not drinking enough water.,
it's really hard to drink more water.,
not yet summer here.,
"axle 222 said: hello i totally empathise with you....i have like you gone through many tests but constipation became worse regardless of trying flax,psyillium husks lactulose,etc etc...",
"i know how you feel not wanting to eat or drink.....i eventually had a colonoscopy which discovered my left traverse colon is kinked,hence no matter what i used it didn't solve the problem.....i am now now on a medication called laxido ,it is cumulative so helps things move through.",
the gastroenterologist said no matter how much fruit (i personally can't digest fibre) it won't work because the colon is too twisted to make for smooth passage.,
as you have tried many things perhaps it's time to consult a gastroenterologist to check your colon.,
hope this gives some help.......... click to expand...,
"thanks for your empathy, it really help to know others understand.",
over the years laxatives and fibre products have relieved the constipation so i think a structural issue is unlikely but i will keep an open mind about it.,
have tried laxido and found it made my stools too soft and caused other issues for me.,
currently i take laxsol (senna and dulcolax) and lactulose.,
i saw a gastroenterologist a year or so ago about the sct and the above meds and psyllium she prescribed fixed it for a long time.,
perhaps it is time to ask for a referral again.,
the wait will be many months though.,
i'm seeing my gp today about something else so will tell her about these issues.,
it just occurred to me i could ask about an oral cleansing solution that is used as a prep for procedures... that might relieve my acute symptoms and enable me to make a fresh start.,
it's better than waiting another week and ending up in a&e.,
indy51 said: the one fibre that works brilliantly for me without giving me any nasty side effects is acacia fibre which is totally soluble fibre and recommended for ibs.,
"every time i've tried flax seeds, they tasted rancid to me so i gave up trying and psyllium just makes me more constipated.",
click to expand...,
"thanks for this recommendation, i will give it some serious thought.",
"psyllium did work for me in the past but i think things got out of whack due to not taking it every day for a while, and eating less fruit and veg, and drinking less water.",
i thought flax seeds would be dramatically better but so far i think the effect has been neutral or worse.,
luckily i don't mind the taste of them.,
"donnellysdogs said: i now have max size hospital enemas incase i miss flaxseed accidentally again... just to save the paramedics, morphine & paracetomal drips and wasting a&e time and resource.",
gp was more than willing to prescribe them.,
click to expand...,
"i have some fleet enemas for acute episodes, and they are about 200ml i think.",
are the ones you have bigger?,
it might pay for me to get some.,
"well, i am feeling a bit more positive after seeing the gp.",
she has prescribed some oral solution - she suggested it before i got a chance to ask for it.,
"it's called lax-sachets and contains macrogol, which i don't mind taking short term in this situation.",
she said i should go back to using psyllium daily and i think i will.,
"once things are more settled i may try introducing a little flaxseed slowly, and it will be summer so i will be drinking more.",
i quite liked the flaxseed and i think it has other benefits.,
this experience has been a reminder to never let constipation get out of control again.,
"the nausea, headache, stomach fullness, reflux and total loss of appetite are not worth it.",
indy51 said: chris kresser has published a new interview with dr mark pimental of cedars sinai who is considered to be at the forefront of ibs/sibo resarch.,
"he talks a lot about constipation, slow motility, etc.",
"so might be of interest to sufferers and especially the connection of methane producing bacteria in severe constipation: http://chriskresser.com/sibo-update...pimentel/?mc_cid=20b3e0c7ea&mc_eid=6bed1d9edd click to expand... that's great, thanks.",
"i think there is a large number of diabetics with slow motility, and if it's mainly their lower gi tract affected they may not know they have it.",
"i think dr bernstein claimed that a third or more of t1s have gastroparesis... it's very sad, because i think these effects can happen in t1s even if they have excellent control.",
it seems to just be the nature of diabetes.,
"i think it's clear though that for any diabetic, the better control they have, the less chance they have of complications or effects like slow motility.",
"in my case i'm pretty sure my slow motility is not diabetes-related, because i am t2, and i have had it since childhood, and several family members have too.",
"we joke about it being [surname] syndrome, lol.",
donnellysdogs said: i don't thonk my slow motility is diabetes related either.,
"once bitten by changing or forgetting what works, boy, you won't let it happen again.",
"mine is only 128ml (huge compated to the 5ml micralax.. just says ""phosphates enema bp, formula b"" - worst thong is trying to hold the liquid up the bowel for 45 mins!!",

i loathe microlax... causes intense burning for me.,
i think the ones you have sound very similar to the ones i have.,
"according to the info below, it works in 1-5 minutes: http://www.fleetlabs.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ics5_1198f01_08209_m1.pdf there are also other kinds now, which sound better: http://www.fleetlabs.com/type/enemas/",
does anyone wear a libre sensor and swim?,
i would like to start swimming but dont want to take a chance incase it falls off.,
any advice would be appreciatted.,
thanks how long do you stay in the pool?,
i just had a sensor that fell off and i have 6 days left...,
strange!,
wow.,
how long do you sit in a steam?,
id love to steam but always been too scared that my sensor will come off from the heat.,
do you cover it?,
i had a swim yesterday and then steamed for about 10 mins and its all still in tact and sticking perfectly.,
i've just made the appointment for my first retinopathy screening and am rather concerned by the receptionist's initial insistence that i should bring someone with me because my eyes will be dilated and my vision blurred afterwards.,

"thanks many thanks for all the responses, especially the advice about sunglasses, the optician never mentioned i might need them!",
"i feel much more easy about the procedure, knowing more details about what will/might happen - personal experiences are much more useful than official advice!",
"i don't drive anyway, and as the optician's is inside a shopping centre, i plan to walk (about 5 minutes) to the entrance, sunglasses at the ready, and get a taxi home or i may have a cuppa in the cafe next door first - the whole thing may take up to two hours, so i may need a pot of tea to build my strength",
does chewing sugar free chewing gum have the ability to cause drops in blood glucose levels?,
"it might just be co-incidence but took the kids out again for the day yesterday, same thing happened as last time with my daughter, unexpected hypos.",
"i was doing more tests and monitoring more closely after the last day out, i realise it could just be the effects of excitement but on both days she was chewing sugar free gum while travelling.",
yesterday morning she went from 10.4 to 3.7 in the space of an hour and i wondered if that was due to her chewing gum which might have made the food digest more quickly???,
"same problem on the way home while she was chewing gum, constantly going hypo until i took the gum away from her and she was then fine!",
it could all just be co-incidence but thought it might be worth mentioning on here to see if anyone else has noticed the same.,
"noblehead said: interesting question but i've not heard of chewing gum causing hypo's, i chew sugar-free gum most days and have never noticed it effecting my bg, perhaps others may say different.",
could the hypo just be due to increased exercise/activities?,
nigel click to expand...,
"both mornings she was sat on a train the early evening hypo she had 22g of carbs in the form of jelly sweets when she tested 4.1 an hour and a half after dinner, she put her chewing gum back in and half an hour later she retested and was 3.7, at that point i took the gum away and she had another 22g of carbs and was fine which was what made me wonder if the gum was speeding up digestion and therefore pushing the sugar through her body too quickly for it to have an effect i have to take her to london tomorrow for an appointment, it will be by train so i will leave the gum at home and see what happens!",
"when she was on premix i used to do that, sweets then 10mins later biscuits i was told on basal/bolus she only needs the fast acting to get her up and nothing to keep her up as she should just stay up :?",
"most of the time that works ok, maybe it depends on time of day???",
"on friday at school, she dropped to 2.8 at 9:45am, she ate 2 packs of haribo 22g and a cereal bar 15g and was then 18.7 at 12pm i realise some of that could have been glucose from the liver but to me she overtreated that hypo, i have written in the book she carries in her bag that 10g will raise her 4 to try and make it easier for her when i am not around but she does not follow it!",
"oh i completely understand that, that low feeling must be horrible and yes the quicker you can get rid of that the better!",
"i have overtreated her hypos in the past, mainly at night!!",
"when she was on premix, she was only having 2 units morning and 1 unit evening but every other night she would get up 2 hours after going to bed feeling low, i would give her something, wait 20mins and retest but she would drive me mad constantly saying i still feel really low i need something else so i would give in to her and give her more to get rid of her back to bed now that i know how many grams of carbs raise her by how much i am much stricter with her!!",
"today she dropped to 3.3 at 11:20am so i gave her half a cup of apple juice and ignored her pleas for more, she was then 5.9 before lunch at 12 so what she had was exactly right noblehead said: spearmint said: when she was on premix i used to do that, sweets then 10mins later biscuits i was told on basal/bolus she only needs the fast acting to get her up and nothing to keep her up as she should just stay up :?",

"but the 2nd time it happened it got me thinking.... today's train journeys to london and back: no chewing gum, no sugar free sweets, just water no hypos i know it could still be co-incidence but i think i will ban chewing gum for now!",

"what are the views of members to this menu, any thing marked with a d is deemed suitable",
can someone possibly help me.,
right now i am very ill with diabetes type 2.,
i love yogurts but am struggling to find any with as near as or lower than 5g sugar in them.,
does anyone know of any suitable yogurts to buy?,
thanks very much.,
"i thank everyone for their reply and as suggested just bought some irish yogurts from my local sainsnbury's, however upon getting home and reading the ingredients, there is too much sugar in at 9g per 125 ml pot.",

"hello folks i've been following a low carb diet, moderate fat intake for 2 months now.",
"after asking tons of questions on this marvellous forum, i've learnt how this way of eating works.",
"via testing, i know i am consistently in nutritional ketosis.",
i am currently losing about a 1lb a day in weight...which is great.,
"but, is it normal?",
i'm aware other members have achieved huge weight loss whilst eating lchf.,
but i'm unsure of the overall timescale.,
recent blood screening shows i don't have thyroid problems.,
all advice gratefully received.,
ali.,
"x andbreathe said: so, in two months you have lost 4 stones?",
"at the outset, how much did you have to lose, and how close are you now to your target?",
click to expand... hi andbreathe perhaps i should have explained myself better.,
so here goes.,
"since diagnosis in january, i followed what i had been advised was a healthy diet, with plenty of whole grains, fruit etc.",
i was frustrated that my blood glucose remained in the mid to high teens despite oral medication.,
clearly i was making several basic mistakes when i thought i was eating healthily.,
"other forum members educated me about lchf eating, which i decided to try.",
"over the next week, my blood glucose levels came right down & i was able to reduce my medication.",
i was eating around 50g of carbs a day when i first began clean eating & lchf.,
"but, for the last month, maybe a little longer, i've reduced this even more as i want to stop my prescribed gliclazide completely, preferring to be on metformin only.",
"my carb intake right now is no more than 20g, & to be honest usually much much less.",
i haven't got much of an appetite so suspect my intake is low in calories too.,
"when testing, my ketostix indicate my ketone level at 4.0, which is ""moderate.""",
this is with a bg level of 5.5 on average.,
members have told me that i have reached nutritional ketosis & that my body is now burning fat in the absence of carbs.,
"so, since reducing my carbs to less than 20g each day, my weight loss has increased and with my current level of ketosis, i'm losing on average 1lb per day.",
this week alone i have lost 5lb since sunday.,
and last week i lost 6lb.,
my husband & family have commented on how skinny i'm becoming...which i'm not.,
"but in comparison to what i was 4 months ago, i'm over 3 stone lighter.",
but the rapid weight loss has certainly been more evident since my diet changed to very low carb.,
"i guess what i'm wondering is whether this is normal when in ketosis, & is it healthy.",
"i do feel dizzy at times, but have put that down to the medication.",
jack412 said: do you want to slow it down?,
"how are you feeling, do you see any diet like symptoms?",
how much more weight do you want to lose?,
it is a lot a week and twice that is recommended www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kyyneaycgk view attachment 12918 click to expand... hi jack412 that was a very useful link.,
thank you.,
ali.,
"x andbreathe said: so, in reality, the statement of about a pound a day is over the last two weeks, with more being lost over three or four months?",
"assuming that is the case, i wouldn't be too concerned about the rapidity of the weightloss, at this early stage of very low carbing, but i would be concerned about the light headedness, if it continues.",
"when we lose weight, it is often from places we'd rather not.",
"for example, in we women, it's often our faces, necks and bosoms.",
"that's particularly annoying as it's not usually where we carry most, and it's where we can look a bit drawn.",
"well, the face and neck that is.",
"in my experience, over a period your body sort of catches up, and also people get used to seeing the slimmer you.",
how much more weight do you have to lose?,
that would probably influence anything else i might say.,
"click to expand... yeah andbreathe, i guess that's a more realistic assessment.",
but i've lost over a stone in 3 weeks.,
what i don't want is for the weight loss to continue at this pace leaving me with saggy skin & loss of muscle mass.,
"i'm losing inches all over to be honest...legs, tummy n butt are noticeably slimmer.",
"but yeah, the face, neck & chest too.",
dropped 4 dress sizes since christmas.,
"don't get me wrong, i welcome this.",
and it's nice to get my figure back.,
"i just want to lose weight healthily & was worried if i continue as i am, such weight loss could be detrimental.",
i still have several stone to lose to get to where i'd be happy.,
so all and any advice is welcome.,
ali.,
"x andbreathe said: well, for my 2p worth, you probably need to eat more.",
"you will only burn muscle if you aren't eating enough, and your body is starving.",
"obviously, i'd be suggesting keeping lower carb, but the levels you are at are pretty brutal.",
"more fat, and maybe more protein would help.",
"as we're all a bit different, you have to experiment to a degree.",
"tight blood scores were always my primary objective, but a nice low hba1c or finger prick testing is irrelevant if it's killing you to achieve it.",
"i won't suggest moderation in all things, except to maybe suggest you moderate your approach a bit.",
click to expand... good advice.,
"your last comment isn't what i'd call subtle, but it made me smile.",
maybe i'm guilty of wanting things to happen too quickly..that's the personality & nothing else i'm afraid.,
oh well!,
time for some sf jelly & double cream me thinks.,
thanks.,
your 2p worth was welcome.,

x andbreathe said: it was never intended to be subtle.,

i'm afraid my humour may be lost on some.,
"your ""subtle"" works for me is all i meant.",
"i've taken your advice on board though, and agree, my low carb regime is brutal compared to some.",
"there's soooo much to learn about this disease, and how to ""master"" it.",
"i guess just moving in the right direction with good bg, hba1c, weight loss & low risk of diabetic complications should be my priority.",
"brett said: my 2ps worth, if you were diagnosed in jan, and been having meds, did they test you for gad antibodies.",
if your bg was to shoot up you'd be in serious trouble immediately with the ketones already present at that level.,
as per the other advice try to bring them down.,
it was when people kept telling me id lost alot of weight i went to docs and diagnosed type 1.,
"shortly after starting on insulin i needed little to none afterwards, and, had i been out on oral meds initially i may of got on ok for a while as my pancreas had a second go before packing up.",
i'm just being cautious telling you so keep testing regular and stay safe.,
click to expand... hi brett i just had to google gad antibodies.,
interesting information.,
"and no, i haven't been tested.",
i hear what you're saying about the ketone level...and clearly i need to adjust my diet to ensure my nutritional ketosis happens in the optimum level as shown in the graph above posted by jack412.,
"i'm still learning how to cope with & manage my disease, and i'm impatient.",
not always helpful.,
"your advice to keep testing regularly is sensible, and i appreciate you replying to my question.",
"educating myself further, & learning through experience seems to be my way forward.",
i hope i don't make too many mistakes as i get there!,
best wishes & thanks.,

i'm 16 and it's been a month since i've been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.,
"i know before i have at least 10 years before kidney dysfunction, eye blindness and amputation kicks in and at least eight years before die so now honestly, am i terminal?",
i mean i only have 18 years before i die right?,
my doctor is a jerk and he didn't answer my question regarding the complications of diabetes.,
what are the odds of a diabetic living more than 30 years?,
i'm still frightened.,
do you know anyone who lived with type one more than at least 35 years?,
at least without complications?,
i'm really looking after myself but what's the point?,
i'll need to wait on the kidney donor list in my 40s or 50s for long time.,
dialysis.,
amputation also makes me cry.,
thanks for your emphasis.,
it was a relief.,
", do you have any link to official statistics?",
thanks fellas.,
my niece is coming over for a bite to eat on tuesday 18th.,
i look forward to seeing her.,
"she's a lovely young woman in her mid 20es, but last time we were together she giggled and mentioned that she had to get up 4 times every night to pee.",
"i can't remember the context, but then she remarked how much she loved her potatoes, and had rather a large helping.",
"i advised her to get her a1c checked at her gps, and left it at that.",
"i doubt she's taken my advice, though.",
when i invited her and her boyfriend i asked her if there was anything she didn't eat.,
she said she'd be happy as long as there were either plenty of rice or potatoes.,
all very well.,
"i don't mind cooking carbs for others at all, so her wish is my command, of course, but i am a little worried about her for the following reasons.",
"her night pees, the fact that she's adopted from india, t2 nation of the world for whatever reason, and she's gone from slim to somewhat chubby over the last 5-6 years.",
"i'm probably just being a bit paranoid on her behalf, and wonder if i should mind my own business, or nudge her to have it checked out.",
what would you do?,
thanks.,
it's great to hear the opinions of others.,
"i'll do my husband's carby packed lunch and get back to the forum in a bit you're right, all of you.",
i can't just stand by and do nothing at all.,
"it's just that i'm not a pushy person, and would hate to overstep her boundaries.",
i hope she'll understand that my only reason for meddling is her own wellbeing.,
"i also hope she'll get it checked out, and that my fears will prove groundless, like they did when i had my younger, very obese sister checked out.",
"she has enough on her plate as it is, but no reason to heap even more on that proverbial plate in years to come, if it can be prevented.",
thanks for your help.,

"robbity said: i was going to suggest this too - i once did something similar with my nearly-as-overweight-as-me sister, but unfortunately we never got to do a final 2 hour post meal test as she had to leave for a long trip home ... robbity click to expand... do you know if she got tested later, and was she ok?",
"all i know is that the gp told my younger sister to go for some long walks and to get her pulse up, but she's mentally handicapped and it's very difficult to get a straight answer from her, so i still don't know what the result of her blood test was.",
i do know that if one day she's diagnosed with t2 it'll be impossible for me to help her.,
"she lives a 5 hour drive away from me, and wouldn't be able to manage any sort of diet, and everybody around her thinks that low fat is the way to go.",
"holding my fingers crossed for her phoenix55 said: if she doesn't rise to the 'bait' perhaps in a quiet moment suggest that you are concerned about her recent weight gain, perhaps compliment her on her more curvy figure.",
you may find that she is concerned about weight gain herself but has put it down to some other reason.,
if nothing comes from it leave well alone but let her know that you are eating a different meal because you are diabetic.,
"if she comes back to you then all well and good, if not then be the loving aunt you are already, who is eager to listen.",
"at times it is difficult to back off from something that we see as obvious, but we each have to come to the position of admitting that we need help ourselves.",
it is best to keep the communication channels open.,

thanks.,
"i think i'll leave the weight gain alone, but perhaps jokingly ask her if she's still doing her nocturnal sojourns to the loo.",
"weight gain is such a touchy subject for most people, and i'd hate to push her away from me.",
"she might not know that people of asian descent tend to be at greater risk for getting t2, but i might slip that in too.",
i'll play it by ear and go very gently with her.,
let's see what happens.,
if i plan too carefully she's likely to smell a rat she does know that i eat lchf and that i'm doing it to keep my bs low and stable.,
"her dad is wonderful at cooking lchf meals for me, and picked up on the idea in no time.",
"i eat so much better at their place than at home update: everything went well, and i do mean everything.",
"she didn't take my bg meter bait, but she's such an open person that 2 hours after the meal (low carb chicken casserole with cauliflower for me and rice for her) i decided to be frank with her.",
"i told her about the high number of t2 patients in asia, and that she got me worried when she mentioned her nightly pees.",
i asked her if she'd like me to test her blood sugar.,
"she agreed, and was even pleased that i told her about the high frequency of t2s in india, as she didn't know, and would bear it in mind in future.",
"anyway, two hours after her very carby meal we tested, and the result was 5.7!!",
yay!,
"nothing to worry about at the moment, and we were both really pleased.",
i have recently been diagnosed with t2 diabetes and am still in shock.,
i am only 36 years old.,
has anyone tried herbalife for weight loss?,
any advice?,
my gp actually recommended it to me as she tried it and lost lot of weight.,
she said it is safe for diabetics.,
i take metformin 500 mg three times a day.,
any advice would be hugely appreciated!,
thanks thank you all so much for your advice.,
much appreciated!,
will look at all the resources you have kindly shared x,
hi.,
i want to add some variety to my low carb diet.,
is porridge good or bad in this regard?,
it keeps me feeling full for longer but oats must be a carbohydrate.,
any advice?,
"hi, have felt rough last 2 days, with a head cold kicking in and bg levels climbing upwards 17.6 at the moment!",
"the most discomfort is a terrible sore throat, i used to have honey,lemon juice with hot water to sip to ease this, as a diabetic now am wondering if i could still do this?",
as i did find it was effective and eased it a litttle.,
"anyone else do this or something else that is effective and alcohol free too, i really cant do the whiskey hot toddy thing.",
as every time i swallow it feels like sharp glass and is awful.,
no improvement tomorrow am off to see the gp.,
anna.,
hi everyone.,
"thanks for all your help and suggestions, i did finally end up doing warmed cooled down [boiled] sugar free vimto drinks.",
lived off this last weekend and this week.,
as coffee made me feel worse!,
"sore throat eased off now , just left with an dry tickly cough cough cough !!",

"hi everyone, my mother recently had a thorough examination and blood test with her new doctor and they realized that her morning fasting blood glucose level was 5.8.",
"the doctor was surprised [we have no type 2 diabetes in our family history, my mother has always eaten very well, and the doctor was very impressed with what great shape she's in - she's probably in better shape than i am!!!].",
"anyway, the doctor said it might be a blip, so they are re-testing, but i am just curious if you could let me know what a high fasting # might be attributed to?",
"other than type 2 (which, i know, might be the case), what other disorders/diseases might cause a high fasting blood sugar number?",
"excuse my ignorance, but do some non-diabetics suffer from hyperglycemia?",
"[as i have heard some non-diabetics can be hypoglycemic, and need to eat regularly etc.",
kinda like diabetics].,
"my mother and her doctor are on this, so we are already trying to figure out the peculiar results, but just wondered if anyone had any information/experience with this?",
thanks!,
thank you for the information.,
"yes, my mom is non-diabetic and, yes, the gp is doing further testing.",
"i assumed that the list of potential causes was too long (and potentially too worrying), but thank you for your feedback.",
sorry for the confusion re: my use of the term 'fasting' blood glucose level.,
i used it to refer to the fact that she had fasted since 12am that morning.,
sorry for the lack of clarity.,
o.k.,
"will wait and see what the second blood test, and her doctor's analysis, reveal.",
thanks,
does anyone else get the symptoms of a hypo when their sugars are still above 4?,
"i get dizzy, shaky and confused wihtout my blood sugar dipping below 4.",
if i am tired or stressed this will happen.,
if i haven't eaten it will happen too.,
bulkbiker said: how long have you been diagnosed and has your blood sugar been relatively high in the past?,
click to expand... 15 months.,
"no my sugars are in range... mel dcp said: whats your usual range, and how low are you when you get these symptoms?",
click to expand... my usual range is 5.5 to 8.,
occasionally up to 10 after eating.,
the lowest ive recorded when shaky and confused is 4.7 but sometimes i can be 7 during these symptoms.,
but mostly im too confused to remember to test.,
sani thomas said: i used to get these in the beginning of starting insulin and still very occasionally get them now.,

"thank you djc3 said: i have also found this - if i eat a meal higher in carbs than usual, not only does my bg rise quickly but it also seems to crash afterwards.",
"although not in real hypo territory it seems to me that it is the speed of the drop - not the final figure, which makes me feel shaky.",
personally i have found that sticking to low carb foods stops this effect.,

thank you.,
v helpful kk123 said: i do sometimes.,
"when i reach the mid to low fours i get all of those symptoms, i was told it is simply a warning sign, ie do something or else!",
i was also told that when it then drops into the 2s and 3s you've left it too late!,

great!!!,
thanks so much,
just had my latest blood test results.,
"had one a month ago & my nurse was concerned over my liver function numbers, so had another test last week.",
in the meantime i've been a bit more disciplined with my low carb diet & been hiking more than usual.,
"my average carb intake over the month has been 73g per day, & my average bg has been 6.3 on my self tests.",
i've even managed to lose a stone!,
the numbers yesterday were good from a diabetes perspective:- glucose level 6.1 hdl cholesterol 1.3 total cholesterol 3.9 cholesterol/hdl ratio 2.5 trigs 1.5 (i think that's high - but my nurse says it's ok) the new concern is my platelet count which is 130 against an acceptable range of 140-400.,
it was 128 last time but they didn't choose to mention it!,
i don't have a family history of haemophilia so this is a worry.,
has anyone come across a diabetes related cause for this sort of thing?,
thanks thanks hlw.,
been away for a week so didn't pick up your reply until today.,
certainly sounds logical.,
i'm seeing the doctor later today...........,
thanks for the replies guys.,
"sorry for the slow response, it's been a heck of a few weeks - made redundant, rebuilt my pc & started a new job.",
and all without adverse impacts.,
"saw my gp as planned, who questioned why i'd come to see him :roll: my response of ""errr, 'cos your diabetes nurse told me you wanted to see me"" resulted in an interesting few minutes of discussing the effectiveness of diagnosis by statistic rather than symptom.",
"the upshot is that my ""low"" levels are ""normal"" for me, which the nurse would have spotted if she'd looked at previous results.",
:roll: so worry over.,
hi i am currently on 2000mg metformin plus 2 x gliclazide tablets and 1 of pioglitozide daily.,
"my doctor says the next step is insulin injections, although in the information inside the metformin box it says maximum dose can be 3000 mg daily.",
can i ask to try the higher dose of 3000 mg daily.,
my blood sugars are anything from 7.5 to 9.5 daily.,
"i am type 2 diabetic and, since being diagnosed 3 years ago, my blood glucose readings have climbed inexorably, never going below 15.1 mmols/litre and more usually about 17.5mmols/litre before meals.",
"i have been on metformin, then gliclazide; since yesterday, i am on novomix 30 insulin twice daily, plus 1 gliclazide tablet twice daily.",
"about eight weeks ago, i noticed that my foreskin (only) was sore, red & swollen (posthitis).",
"since then, it has fluctuated from being near normal to very sore, all the time with skin shedding.",
i haven't had sexual intercourse for about two years :shock: so i know i have not picked up an infection.,
"i have tried more frequent washing, hydrocortisone cream, canesten cream, chlorhexidine cream and vaseline.",
"only the vaseline has had any effect, possibly because it protects the foreskin from urine.",
that made me think that it might be something in my urine.,
"i wonder, as my blood glucose levels are quite high, might i have ketones (acid) in my urine that is causing the irritation?",
do ketones cause such problems?,
has anyone (man or woman) experienced similar irritation?,
:?,
"thank-you everyone, for your replies.",
i am seeing my diabetes nurse in a few days and will bring up the subject when i see her.,
"when the cause is found, i will report back to this thread.",
acron^ said: this one was a main symptom behind my diagnosis as well.,
i had chronic thrush for about 6 months and nothing i did would make any different.,
"it's still not gone now, but i'm only a month since diagnosis and have more pressing issues on my mind.",
will try for lamisil next time i'm at the gps.,
"but seriously kansenji, you need to get those levels down pronto.",
hopefully the novomix will do the trick.,
"also, which bg meter do you use?",
"some of them (like the optium xceed) allow for ketone testing as well and you should be able to obtain strips, if you're really worried.",
it's worth checking out if you've been high for so long.,
click to expand...,
"yes, i use the optium xceed meter too.",
"when i saw my diabetes nurse a couple of days ago, i mentioned the ""ketones"" alert on my meter and she said (wait for it) "" ketones testing is for type 1 diabetes only ! """,
"this is the same nurse who said that "" type 2 diabetics don't get hypos "" ( http://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes-forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=3021 ) a few months ago.",
":shock: thankfully, as i'm gradually increasing the insulin doses (currently on 28 units a day), my fasting blood glucose is now down around the 11/12mmols/l area and the inflammation mentioned earlier, is lessening.",
my nurse also prescribed a fresh tube of canesten (clotrimozole) as my old one was at its expiry date.,
"i'm still not sure the canesten is working, but will keep on with it for a while.",
"chocfish said: hmmmm yes i have in the past suffered from thrush so badly that i could barely walk, and whatever what was prescribed for me didnt work, the condition improved as my bg levels dropped but my immune system was still not so strong and despite lower bg i still got all these fungal infections and soreness for quite a while.",
that is when i was advised to start drinking kefir (as well as doing all the other things that are good for me and got me to the stage i am now) - also i was advised not to use toilet paper (even the softest rolls i could buy felt like heavy duty industrial sandpaper that was impregnated with vinegar) so started using babywipes instead (much cheaper than moist toilet tissue).,
and this really helped and i havent suffered with this complaint for about 7 years now.,
hope you feel better soon karen i hope this wasnt too personal.,
"click to expand... hi karen, one of the things that is great about this forum, is that we can ""talk"" about very personal things, just like the very sensible adults that we surely are; so nothing is too personal as far as i am concerned.",
we should be able to freely talk about foreskins and women's parts in a straightforward and practical manner.,
i'm sorry your soreness was so bad that you could barely walk; my wife seems to get a lot of soreness :cry: so i can imagine how bad it was for you.,
i hadn't heard of kefir before and have just looked it up on wikipedia here .,
i will try and source it and give it a try.,
"because i am a man & therefore have a hairy bum, :shock: i have used baby wipes for improved hygiene for several years.",
"i use the morrissons ones with with a plastic lid, as they are the only ones i have found that have two plastic flaps that try to stop multiple wipes coming out at once.",
another advantage with wipes is that they do not disintegrate & stick to you as toilet tissues do!,
thank-you for your helpful post.,
"just about to order a takeaway curry - first one, post diagnosis - and i was just wondering what the verdict is on curries for diabetics.",
are there any dishes that are particularly good for diabetics?,
and any that i should avoid?,
are creamy sauces good or bad?,
"i'm vegetarian, so hopefully that will make it easier.",
"mmmm, curry...",
thanks everyone.,
i ended up having a fairly regular curry in the end.,
"a smaller amount of rice than i used to have - and home cooked wholegrain rice rather than ordered in - and then a bit of creamy vegetable/paneer dish, some mushroom bhaji and some tarka dahl, with a couple of small bits of naan too.",
felt fine.,
"hi all, i was prediabetic on 1500 normal metformin a day.",
turned diabetic had metformin increased to 2g per day and put on slow release.,
was working well with lc diet as well went from hba1c of 53 to 40 in 3 months.,
"always had constipation problems, but just recently changed to 5 days constipation then stools normal and then 2 days roughly of diarrhea then constipated again.",
gp thought diarrhea was overflow and i was told to take cosmocol which is basically like fibergel.,
but it didn't improve gp has now advised to stop metformin for ten days to see if diarrhea stops.,
"i presume if so he will stop it all together, if not then he will investigate further.",
my concern is if i stop metformin will my blood sugars go up again?,
does anyone have any experience of any of it?,
or can anyone advise whats liable to happen?,
feel rather in the dark and scarred of stopping it to be honest.,
any advise would be appreciated.,
sorry for the unsavory subject matter.,
brunneria said: i am sorry you must be having so much unpleasantness and discomfort!,
"metformin is a useful drug in many ways, but it has less impact on blood glucose than most people think.",
dietary control has much more effect!,
what dietary measures do you have in place to control your blood glucose?,
"and similarly, what dietary measures do you have in place to treat your constipation/diarrhoea?",
"my personal view is that these can have a much better effect than medication, but the trick is to find out what works for you, since we each seem to have remarkably different requirements for gut health.",
"click to expand... hi brunneria, i've reduced all carbs by half and stopped all obvious sugar.",
"i have had some higher fats than normal but avoid it a lot, as its hard to break a habit of a lifetime re cooking etc.",
"as for diet re constipation, i eat a reasonable diet with lots of veg, fruit and roughage.",
i also try to have a reasonable amount of water as well.,
"but it's been a life time problem, the only time they seem to be normal is when i'm binging on carbs and sugar.",
so don't know the answer to that one.,
"maggie sid bonkers said: hi, firstly i wouldnt worry to much about stopping your 1500 mg of metformin as even the highest dose of 2000 mg per day is only going to drop your bg levels by between .5 and 2 mmol/l.",
secondly did you start off on the 1500 mg dose or did you start off on 500 mg per day for a week or two and then increase it by 500 mg every couple of weeks as if it is started this way it often helps avoid the side effects you mention.,
"there is the prolonged release version of metformin which may suit you better and or other drugs that can be prescribed, follow your docs advice and stop the metformin for a couple of weeks and see if your symptoms ease which i imagine they will and then see your doc again and ask about the prolonged or sr version with a gradual increase rather than straight onto a high dose.",
hope this helps and good luck.,
"click to expand... hi sid bonkers, i started on 500mg twice a day, then increased to 500mg three times a day.",
"then have been increased to 1g twice a day of the slow release version, so i'm already on the sr or prolonged release tablets.",
"maggie bluetit1802 said: as others have said, metformin isn't a miracle drug.",
it only helps with blood glucose levels to a limited extent.,
it doesn't promote insulin production.,
"it works on the liver to help reduce the amount of glucose the liver produces, but again only to a limited extent.",
it is mainly an appetite suppressant that helps with weight loss.,
unless you had other health issues when you were pre-diabetic (such as pcos) i am very surprised you were prescribed it.,
even with a diagnostic hba1c of 53 i am surprised.,
"most newly diagnosed with that level are normally told to diet and exercise, come back in 3 months and we'll see how you are.",
that was certainly the case for me.,
"my hba1c was 53 and metformin has never been mentioned, at any time.",
i would do as your doctor says and keep an eye on your levels before and after meals - especially before evening meal.,
"click to expand... hi bluetit1802 thanks for the advise, i think i was prescribe it for its weight loss properties as well as having diabetes.",
as i have quite a lot to loose.,
also my hba1c kept continuing to rise despite being on metformin when pre-diabetic which is why they put it up to max dose.,
i've asked the diabetic nurse at gp to phone me tomorrow so i can discuss it with her and see if she will give me some more test strips so i can test every day and keep a proper eye on things for if nothing else a good piece of mind.,
cheers maggie bulkbiker said: ok but @maggie/magpie are your concerns less now that you have read all that has been written?,
you seemed very concerned about stopping the meds for a while but i don't think it will do you much (probably no ) harm at all.,
i'm guessing the vast majority of your improvement has come about by changing your diet rather than the pills.,
"click to expand... hi bulk biker, everyones advice is always gratefully received and goes a long way to putting my mind at rest.",
which is why i keep posting.,
i now have a plan for going forward with all of this so thank you and everyone else for replying.,
maggie thank you all for all your help and advise maggie/magpie,
hi i am t2 diabetic.,
i have toenail fungus on at least 3 toenails.,
i have just tried boots advanced footcare fungal nail treatment pen.,
it didn't work.,
i was wondering if anyone can post a link to a treatment that does work!,
?,
thanks :wink: hi all ..,
thanks for all your input.,
i thought this would be a common problem amongst diabetics.,
"my dn when examining my feet just shrugged and said ""oh you've got toenail fungus"" as if it was the norm!",
i shall try some tea tree oil as suggested .,
my nails don't seem to grow very fast so i realise it may be a long job.,
i would love to have lovely varnished toenails for the summer.,
my mum always used to say if you don't look after your feet...they won't look after you!,
thanks again.,
hi all my wife is 36 weeks pregnant and type 1 diabetic.,
shes had an infection for the past few days and last night had keytones of 2.1 so being the good diabetic we took her to the on call doctor.,
all he suggested was to drink plenty and to rest...... this morning keytones are 3.8 we spoke to her dsn this morning who said she needs to be hospitalized and put on a drip immediately.,
so as this is now an emergency (and in my opinion was last night) i dialed 999 for an ambulance gave all the details of the address the 999 operator asked to speak to my wife so i passed the phone over.,
he said its not an emergency so an ambulance wouldnt be sent and nhs direct would call back to arrange transport......... has anyone else had this issue?,
did i jump the gun with the 999 call?,
"dawnmc said: sorry if i'm being blunt, but couldn't you have got her there yourself or get a taxi.",
999 calls are for people who really really are in trouble.,
i do hope your wife is ok and being seen to.,
click to expand... ok my wife is heavily pregnant and suffers for severe spd (basically unless she uses crutches and my support she can not walk) we have a 4 year old and a almost 2 year old so i cant just leave them at home.,
we do not have a car as we had to get rid of it due to cost.,
a taxi on average is 5-7 per trip bearing in mind that in 3 days this is the 3rd time she has had to go to hospital requiring a taxi each way so we are literally running on an empty bank account.,
as for keytones your probably not aware as much as type 1's what they are but they can result in coma and sever complications extremely rapidly as keytonacidosis is where your blood turns acidic you also start to vomit which leaves you dehydrated magnifying the original issue) as for ambulances that are for people really in trouble i agree and when shes hypo and unconscious i will treat her with glucagon first and only call medics when i cant bring her round.,
infact in 10 years i have only needed to call 999 3 times including this.,
i would love to know though why people that have drunk too much at the weekend as an example are really in trouble.... and as an update to show just how good the nhs is my wife was not offered a drink of water in a&e (while in the cubical) and was not checked on.,
if her dns had not called the a&e department she would have been in a coma about now as she was starting to lapse in to unconsciousness when they went in to talk to her.,
"bethan90 said: if your wife was able to mobilise and talk then they would not class her as a priority over those people having heart attacks and cardiac arrests, so therefore it would have been quicker for you to take her in yourself anyway.",
"the doctor was probably being a bit ignorant of the fact that she is a diabetic with ketones, as it's v common (and not dangerous) for pregnant women to have a few ketones in their urine and the advice is to hydrate.",
click to expand... first of all bethan90 we spoke to her dsn this morning who advised the urgent treatment so id love to know how a specialist in the field was being ignorant.,
as for keytones not being dangerous id love to know what idiot told you that.,
they are dangerous at any point to a diabetic at high levels.,
i would suggest asking your dns if he/she can explain to you what would happen if you had dka for an extended period.,
"ambrennan said: that's not great, if you phone an ambulance it should come click to expand... well, no.",
"the person dialling 999 is, by and large, not qualified to tell if a situation requires an ambulance or not.",
click to expand... and 90% of the time neither is the operator on the other end of the phone.,
they use a very similar system to nhs direct to assess if an ambulance should be sent.,
"just to prove how ""informed they are"" the last time i had to call an ambulance for her having a hypo after not being ale to bring her around after 2x glucagons and 6 tubes of glucogel and her pump being disabled and her starting to fit.",
the operator said to me have you given her any insulin to bring her around........ lucylocket61 said: lightwolfe you have mentioned your financial circumstances.,
can you claim any tax credits or child tax credit?,
"if so, the hospital will refund your essential costs of getting to and from the hospital.",
"you need to ask the reception staff to give you a signed form after attending a & e. the tax credit people, if you get any, will give you a card to get free prescriptions for the whole family, and that is the card you show to the hospital office to claim back the money.",
"it might also be worth going to your surgery, explaining your situation to the practice manager, and they will be able to offer you advice on this too.",
click to expand... we do get tax credits but not at a high enough level to get prescriptions ect.,
on paper my wife earns just over the threshold although in the last tax year we earnt as a 2 adult 2 kid family about 13k that was taxable yes and if it wasn't for that she would more than likely not be here :/ at the moment she has to change her infusion set for her pump every 2 days (average fill of about 200-250 units) and has to test her sugars a stupid amount of time (over 300 tests a month).,
on the plus side though im never short of a sieve,
hi can anyone help.,
my partner is diabetic type 1 and has been for some years.,
"he told me he controls it well, i too thought this was the case until i went with him for one of his appointments and was told otherwise.",
( he wasnt lying to me just doesnt know how to handle it) to cut a long story short i am now reading everything i can and have changed his diet totally.,
my question though is on flours.,
what is the best type of flour to use?,
"wholemeal, wheat, granary etc etc.",
i have just today bought some chickpea gram flour at a local organic farmers market and want to know if this too is ok.,
i am finding it all very confusing.,
"he is spanish and loves his bread, its been the hardest thing ever for him cutting right down to one little roll a day.",
"this has to be done though, he has a diabetic brother who over the last year has had both his legs removed and also two fingers.",
i am really determined not to let my partner go down this road.,
thanks in advance.,
thanks both of you for answering.,
i am looking forward to looking through this site.,
being so new it is a bit daunting but im sure it doesnt take too long to get to grips with it.,
ive never used a forum before but i think its the way forward for me.,
also the online course sounds fantastic.,
thankyou.,
my partner said he was offered some help in the very begining with the carbs but it sounds to me like it wasnt really the best.,
"they suggest eating everything in moderation , sugar too as long as he has 6 meals a day.",
(???,
)i have to remember that we are in the deep country of andalucia and i know from experience with my son and doctors they dont always see things like us english.,
im going to see if we can get another appointment via our normal gp and see if times have moved on since he last went.,
thanks again.,
"iand said: i'm not type 1, but hope my answer will help.",
"i use a combination of almond flour, coconut flour & milled flax seed, with baking powder, mixed with eggs & olive oil.",
that gives an acceptable cake texture bread.,
you could include gram flour.,
"i use as a breakfast cereal almond flour, coconut flour & milled flax seed cooked with soya milk.",
the recipes are on the forum & i can look them up if you want.,
click to expand...,
"thanks for the recipe, i cannot get coconut flour here ( in spain) but i am guessing i could use a little more of the others or maybe some gram flour.",
i make my own almond flour by grounding up our own home grown almonds and flax seed is easy to get here and i use it a lot.,
i have looked for the recipe and cant seem to find it.,
if you do have it or a link to it i would be very grateful.,
is the bread like a flat bread?,
thanks again.,
:thumbup: iand said: any combination of low carb flours should do ok - mine are different every time.,
it's a spongy cake texture about 25 mm thick.,
you could leave out the sweetener & sultanas for a bread.,
i do.,
i normally slice & spread with butter or flora pro-active.,
a slice replaces potato to soak up gravy.,
after the first day it's best kept in the fridge.,
"just made a low carb birthday cake for sunday: very roughly: 100 g ground almonds 50 g coconut flour 50 g soya flour 25 g oat bran 25 g milled flax seed 2 teasp baking powder 1 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp coriander 2 tabsp non-sugar sweetener all sieved together 90 ml olive oil 4 eggs beaten together 1 handful sultanas thoroughly mix check for dropping consistence - i added the 4th egg put in square silicone baking dish - 9"", 220 mm bake for 20 minutes at 175 c nice spongy texture cut in half & stick together with cheese spread i might ""ice"" it with cheese spread or cream[/quote thank you for this recipe.",
i am going to give it a try tomorrow.,
this might seem a bit of a silly question but how do you ice with cheese spread?,
do you add any thing else to it or just use the cheese spread??,
"thanks click to expand... @ phoenix , bonjour......",
very interesting in what you are saying and what a good idea assuming that 50% of the weight is carbohydrate.,
i have been a bit scared to guess at things.,
"there is some lovley bread sold at an organic market here, i wonder if they would be any good.",
they do a brown spelt with sunflower seeds that always looks so good.,
think i might try it next week.,
also i would really like to make my own bread.,
finding it very hard to find a good recipe where i will be able to work out the carbs.,
thanks,
can anyone help me out here when i got up late today after some long shifts at work (got up at 2:00pm)tested my blood sugars and it read 4.5 is this low :?,
": what is btw tired but i,ve just started new job and its long hours and different each week also should i try eating small amounts but often (so shifts are 4:45-1700) thank you for that",
"ok i am a 42 year old type 2 diabetic... for a few years (since i was diagnosed about 5 years ago infact) i have been a bad diabetic, definetly eat all the wrong things, and no real form of exercise !",
this year i am making a concerted effort to do things the right way...,
"i have started a much healthier diet regime, and am also trainign at a local gym... after a 50 min cardio workout i like to go and chill in the jacuzzi, sauna and steam room...",
i remember reading on a sauna and steam room once that diabetic people are not suppose to do either... can someone give me some information on this ?,
are they good or bad ?,
i am hyper glychemic (yes i know i spelt it wrong !,
lol) so my sugar levels are usually very high... wondering if it's bad for one type of diabetics and not others ???,
"input please, thanks in advance ok here goes...",
remember i am in england (europe) so we have a different scale to you americans (who even do diabetis bigger lol !),
apparerlently a normal person would have a bs of around 5...,
when i was a bad diabetic (about 5 weeks ago) it was not unusual to have a fastign reading of around 15 give or take a couple points... and after my usual consumption it could be in the high 20's (very worrying !),
ok today my ingers feel like a pin cushion...,
i started by taking a fasting reading which was 9.9 (still a little high for my liking) i had my hearty lunch which was probably more than i should of had (still getting the diet right) 2 prawn and cucumber wholemeal rolls and a soup bumped my bs to 13.6 !,
ok here's the interesting bit...,
i did a 50 minute cardio workout... when i took the reading after this workout my bs had plumeted to 5.7 which would seem a good thing no ?,
i then went into the sauna/jacuzzi/steam room...,
i was a little apprehensive as my bs was already pretty low...,
"i did my usual routine... 10-15 mins in sauna, 10 mins jacuzzi, 5 mins steam room... and 5 mins sauna...",
i should point out the jacuzzi/hot tub isnt overly hot at our club... however the sauna and steam room are lol...,
i drank a lot of water prior to and during this time...,
"when i came out i measured at 5.3, only a slight drop but still a drop... by the time i got home, and had drunk another 500 ml of water i was back up to 5.9...",
"i felt fine, no ill effects, dizzyness or sickness... part two of my experiment will take place tomorrow...",
"i am not going to work out, but instead just have a sauna/jacuzzi/steam room session...",
"similar situation, 2 hours after my lunch...",
"i will monitor the bs before i go in, and after i come out... to see if there is any massive drop... maybe today due to my already low bs from the workout maybe there was no way down for my bs in the sauna (that may be a dumb statement appologies if it is lol) will report back tomorrow on what my finding are from this situation...",
had check up with diabetic nurse and she is pleased with my bg results which have come down to average of 6.,
well done low carbs.,
but with 2 metformin struggling with 'runs to the loo' so she has suggested 1 metformin and 1 gliclazide.,
now experiencing 'weak and wobbly moments' very low blood sugar recording at 3.,
going to have lunch now but this does not feel good.,
is there anything better medication wise as metformin was ok but increasing the dose was not?,
any suggestions greatly received.,
thanks for your quick advice.,
dennis what you particularly said is what i am feeling.,
i have eaten lunch smoked salmon and cream cheese with 2 slices of bread and salad.,
my head was spinning and although feeling a little better after eating i am still not right and thats after nearly an hour.,
"thanks everyone, all sorted.",
spoke to nurse on phone and she asked me the readings - great eh she told me not to check myself - good job i took that advice with a pinch of salt :roll: i suggested how about the slow release metformin and she has prescribed that and i have started that this morning.,
she has told me to take 1 for a fortnight and then up it to 2 for another 2 weeks to see how i 'stomach' that.,
thanks for pointing me in the right direction for what to suggest.,
has anybody experienced a similar event?,
i had a lunch meeting some two weeks ago.,
i consumed more alcohol than expected.,
"i also am not a big drinker, since being diagnosed type 1 in 19888.",
"this meeting was in central london, covent garden to be precise.",
i had also forgotten my test kit which i had left in my car at a tube car park in west london.,
"i had with me my fast acting insulin, but did not have my long acting insulin or blood pressure/cholesterol tablets which were at the hotel room i had booked into about twenty minutes, drive from the tube station car park.",
"on realising that i had drunk far to much to even consider driving, also feeling ill and wanting to get back to my hotel, my friend and me headed back on the tube to our separate destinations.",
"my intention was to go back to my car, collect my blood test kit and my hotel room keys and get a taxi back to the hotel.",
"during the tube journey back i became more and more unwell, showing classic symptoms of hyperglycaemia.",
at south kensington station i had to leave the tube and had to vomit on the station.,
at this point my friend had to leave me to carry on my journey alone.,
"i was experiencing more and more hyperglycaemic symptoms however not having my test kit with me i did not want to administer any fast acting insulin, for obvious reasons.",
i eventually arrived at my tube station and headed for the car.,
"on getting into the car i placed the keys into the ignition as in order to phone a taxi i needed to charge my mobile, i did not as far as i am aware turn on the engine, although the radio was on.",
i must also add at this point that i also intended to purchase a ticket for the car park as the one i had ran out at midnight.,
the next thing i recollect is a police officer screaming through my partially open window that i should get out the car now!!,
i got out of the car and he proceeded to give me a roadside breath test informing me that he suspected me of being in charge of a vehicle whilst being above the prescribed legal limit of alcohol.,
"whilst this was going on i tried, to no avail, to explain the circumstances and that their had been no intention by me to drive.",
"this fell on deaf ears, and subsequent to a positive breath test i was handcuffed and arrested for the above offence.",
at this point i asked if the officer could bring with him my test kit out of the glove compartment as i was a diabetic and concerned that i was suffering from hyperglycaemia.,
"his response was that they would deal with that at the station, at this point i was bundled into a police car and taken to the station.",
"at the station i was searched, as i constantly mentioned my diabetes and my hyperglycaemia, there response was that we will deal with that through the fme (doctor) but first we need to test you on the machine for alcohol levels book you in and also test you for drugs.",
i continued to mention my diabetes to no avail.,
i was arrested at about 22:00 hours and this process lasted until about 23:00 hours.,
all the way through i was told that the doctor was on his way.,
"the custody sgt then informed me that as i was over the prescribed limit i would be placed in a cell for the night until they deemed me fit to interview, i again requested my test kit and fast acting insulin, the reply was that the officer had not brought my test kit and i could not have my insulin until a doctor arrived as they did not know what i could be injecting?",
they then man handled me into a cell.,
"i continued to protest by pressing the door bell, eventually after about 6 operations of the bell they told me the doctor would be delayed and if they thought it was a medical emergency they would call an ambulance.",
"i said it was and i was now feeling very unwell and hyperglycaemic, they disagreed and implied that it was because of the alcohol, wait for the doctor.",
they then switched off the alarm bell.,
"i continued to protest and tried to get their attention by kicking the door, only to be ignored.",
"with no other option to me as far as i could see and knowing there was cctv covering the cell, i took of my shirt, wrapped it around my neck and screamed out of frustration that this was the only way to get a response to my concerns.",
"at this point 3 officers burst through the door, at this point i through the shirt into the corner of the cell, at this point the officers grappled me to the floor face down, handcuffed me behind my back and strapping my legs together from the thighs down to the ankles.",
during this restraint i suffered a blow to my right ear and side of my head also what i can only describe as a severe dead leg.,
after about half an our trussed up like a chicken i was released having had to promise that i would behave?,
i was then moved to another cell as they were expecting allot more people in on a fri night.,
the new cell also had a toilet in it because they were sick of me asking to g to the toilet.,
the cell door was kept open with an officer posted at the door because i was now classed as a suicide risk?,
the doctor eventually arrived at 0300 hrs.,
he could not have been less interested.,
he tested my blood sugar level after asking some basic questions.,
it was 28 mmols.,
"he suggested that because he did not have access to any of my long acting insulin, that he would let me give myself 8 units of my fast acting and that would be sufficient until the next doctor would be in at around 09:00 later that morning.",
"i administered, under his observation 8 units of fast acting insulin, he then let the police return me to the cell and left.",
"the doctor that turned up at 09:00 tested my blood and it was then at 12 mmols and he suggested that i have something to eat, and administer my insulin as i normally would.",
i said that considering what i had been through i was not interested in eating.,
"his response was to say so you are refusing food, advised the police officers to return me to my cell and left.",
i eventually was interviewed re the offence at about 11:30.,
charged and released at about 13:30 hrs.,
is there any wonder that diabetics die in custody!!!!!,
any comments or experiences of a similar vein.,
re: arrested for drunk in charge when actually hyperglycaemi well that was an interesting start to my forum experience!,
"thanks gracek for your somewhat self righteous post, i assume you are teetotal?",
and you have never forgotten to take your test kit with you?,
"nikkig, thank you for the advice, yes i have a very good lawyer who is currently obtaining the custody record, cctv recordings in relation to the separate issue of my treatment in custody, and my separate complaint to the ipcc.",
"well, balirob what can i say, you are obviously fully conversant with the law, however, i would just like to point out that there should be an al edged in the following i hope your not the magistrate?",
"""he has -------- committed an offence and cannot wriggle his way out of it by blaming police!!""",
"and as clarification, the police have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that i intended to drive.",
any way not to carry on justifying my actions any further all i was hoping to achieve was some debate over the issue of the lack of duty of care during custody and the still ignorance of diabetic symptoms by the police.,
mod edit (unneeded insults) thanks picklebean you seem to have grasped the point i was trying to make.,
"i will keep you all updated as to the conclusion of this issue, although in getting some of these responses from supposed diabetics will have to think seriously as to whether i continue.",
i found a hard lump on my eyeball itself.,
i felt it while rubbing the lower lid just below my eye.,
what worries me is that the lump is on the eyeball itself.,
its hard and does not move.,
not sure if its diabetes related.,
i did an internet search and all i could see was pages on eye cancer and now i am so freaked out.,
not slept a wink and am off to a&e.,
has anyone had anything like this?,
thanks thank you mike.,
i am in such a panic.,
surgery or loosing my eye is a huge concern.,
just typing this has made me break out in a sweat.,
turns out to be a cyst.,
"if its not gone in 2 weeks after hot washing it, then surgery.",
my husband has just had his 6 monthly check up at the diabetic clinic.,
the consultant was very pleased with his hba 1c that is 6.4.,
"my husband has normal blood pressure and quite low cholesterol, yet the consultant wants my husband to start taking a low dose of statins as he is 53 years old.",
has anyone else got experience of taking them?,
i am concerned about body pain as my husband already has fibromyalgia and neuropathy which causes him chronic pain and fatigue.,
psignathus said: when i took them for many years i ended feeling very unwell.,
"tired all the time, no energy, problems with memory and aching all over.",
i put this down to aging (i'm 51) however once i read memory issues where a problem with statins i ditched them.,
i can honestly tell you i feel like i did when i was 21 although some of that i attribute to lchf.,
its maddening that doctors treat these very dubious drugs with such a nonchalant attitude.,
i would never consider taking them again unless i had already had a heart attack and then i would have to sit down and carefully consider other options.,
click to expand...,
"i had heard bad things about statins, he already has pain, fatigue and memory problems due to the fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome he suffers from, really don't want to make him worse.",
to be fair the doctor did say it is his choice and he wrote a prescription for a very low dose statin.,
really not sure what to do.,
psignathus said: my statin was only 10mg..........if his cholesterol is 'quite low' then surely your doctor should be working on increasing the cholesterol to help improve memory function.,
"click to expand... his cholesterol is 4.1 which i believe is quite good, his weight and blood pressure are fine too.",
the side effects sound terrible that you suffered jmk1954.,
"the consultant thought the statins would help lower the risk of a possible heart attack in the future as my husband has been a type1 for over 30 years, of course that highers the risk.",
"yet on the other hand he said my husband wasn't a high risk as weight, cholesterol and blood pressure are all good, doesn't really make sense.",
everything i have read about statins is negative.,
its going to take a while this so may i suggest you make yourself a coffee and top up with lashings of double cream of course!,
or if you are reading this during the evening maybe a glass of the red juice!,
maybe it doesnt have to be evening.....or red!,
just make yourself comfy.,
here goes....,
i joined this amazing forum towards the end of last year following my shock diagnosis.,
worried sick.,
"clueless apart from the eat well drawing in my hand, done very roughly by hand (in my very first appointment where you are still in shock) by my diabetic nurse, who also confirmed that this beast that was now inside me was progressive.",
"i would need drugs, and more drugs and maybe insulin.",
she was the same nurse who had treated my mum for about 10 years before her death 11 years ago.,
"i thought 'she knows best, im doomed'.",
i knew my mum's had been progressive so why would i even question her statement.,
the good news was that basically i could eat what i liked but just had to cut down on sugar.,
"i could eat plenty of starchy carbs with a low gi, eat plenty of fruit and veg, cut down on fat, choose low fat dairy, lean meat, blah blah blah.",
you know the script as you had exactly the same no doubt.,
all backed up on the nhs website.,
the threat of metformin was hanging over me as my hba1c was over 48 (62).,
i shudder at the thought of having to take tablets as my mum was offered thalidamide when she was pregnant with me as she was so sick.,
thankfully for me she did not take them.,
"i know metformin works well and has been going for years but i just wanted to see if maybe, just maybe, i could reverse my diagnosis with diet alone.",
i had heard reversal was possible.,
i knew it was as a very close member of my family had a gastric bypass and the t2d disappeared over night more or less.,
"i didnt want to go down the same path as my poor mum who eventually ended up on insulin, registered blind, high bp, stroke and leg wounds that were proving difficult to treat.",
so i googled 'reversing diabetes' and this was the first site i came to - thankfully it wasn't diabetes.org!,
and i have never looked back.,
i learned so much from all the amazing people who are very happy and willing to share their knowledge and can never thank them enough.,
and also the abundance of info on the site itself.,
i started on the lchf woe.,
the weight dropped off me.,
"i went back to the dn with my project book in hand, my weight loss details, my bs readings.",
she said 'nobody has done what you are doing'.,
i checked what she had just said.,
'nobody....ever....in all the years?'.,
"she replied 'not one person has come through that door ever doing what you are doing, they look to me as their google and just follow my advice'.",
i could not believe it because by this point my bs had come down to non diabetic levels (41).,
all through diet.,
and not the one recommended!!,
meds were not mentioned.,
i told her on my 2nd appointment about the diet i was on and she rolled her eyes.,
i said it would only be until i reversed things as i thought that the hf might cause health issues.,
she was happy with that.,
i asked for the 2nd appointment specifically for her to check my hba1c and cholesterol.,
that was 6th feb and it hba1c came back as 47 (pre diabetic) but i knew i was on the right track and felt happy to continue.,
cholestrol was ok too.,
and now i feel happy to stay on this woe permanently as i dont want to get back into that same boat ever again.,
plus i know that the hf part is nothing to concern myself over.,
when i lost 3 stone i wrote up my journey details in the forum thread 'success stories and testimonials'.,
dajana from the press office linked to the site contacted me asking if she could go to the local paper and maybe even national papers with my story.,
"yes, absolutely, spread the word.",
and within a short period of time i was in touch with my local gazette who sent around a photographer.,
i sent my story to them by email and i spoke to the journalist on the phone.,
she only confirmed my age as she said everything she needed to know was in my write up.,
my story went in the paper a week ago today.,
the journalist had edited quite a lot out but still kept much of the important info in so i was happy enough.,
she apologised and said it was a specific template but hoped she had done my story justice.,
when i saw me on the front of the gazette at the check out in the sainsburys superstore at 10.30am i nearly choked on my adonis bar!!!,
i was expecting it that day but in the afternoon when they usually arrive in the shops.,
i quickly bought a copy....and another 6 just in case.,
not sure of what but i thought i better had anyway.,
what if everyone wants a copy as soon as they see this story of reversing diabetes.,
surely everyone would want to read about it.,
all diabetics would want to know how i did it.,
i went online and sure enough it was there too!,
i thought i better get myself home and at my pc ready to answer the influx of questions.,
i was so excited to spread the word..... to date only one comment has been left!!!,
gutted is an understatement.,
then a couple of days ago it popped up on my facebook feed.,
and the comments started!!!,
"i can't tell you how happy i was sitting here on my orange box talking of finger pricking, testing, remission, weight loss, low carb, high fat and people were interested.",
but to me this is a drop in the ocean.,
"as happy as i am to reply and help if i can, it's not enough.",
"i could send my story template to magazines, national papers in the hope it might get published but i know now the response would not be what my heart would yearn for, to ultimately get the message over that they are treating diabetes wrong, giving out bad advice which is ultimately making the disease progressive.",
"putting patients on meds immediately (my friend wants to stay on them so he can eat what he wants even though i have explained this isn't the case, this is not emphasised enough at the outset and if it was maybe people might try this diet).",
the doctors get more money i believe when a patient is put on meds and the pharma companies make billions from it.,
not to mention slimming products and weight loss programmes etc.,
and the food industry continue to profit from heavily prossessed foods making us hungrier than ever.,
viscious circle.,
"so my question is this, i am one tiny voice.",
nobody can really hear me.,
as loud as i am shouting.,
most people are happy turning a deaf ear.,
but what if we got together to do a newspaper article?,
can you imagine the headline ' between them they have lost 100 stone (or more depending on how many are involved) and all of them have reversed their diabetes' this would be eye catching.,
im not sure all of us could get on the sofa with holly and phil but we could give it a whirl.,
and i'm not sure everyone would be happy classing it as reversal as this is a grey area.,
we all know that going back to the old way of eating would usually put us right back to square 1 but it would definitely grab attention more than remission!,
"we could protest about the way diabetes is being treated currently, maybe go down the rebellious route and march on with banners demanding to speak to the pm (although i think she might have enough on her plate at the moment.....i dont know if it will be low carb food on there either even though she is diabetic!)",
i felt so good doing the article but then so flat at lack of feedback.,
here is the gazette link so you get an idea of how little response it got.,
i have however had over 40 comments on their facebook link to the article.,
and they are still coming in i'm happy to say.,
https://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/...is-and-lost-weight-by-cutting-carbs-1-9233089 not giving up spreading the word thats all i know at the moment.,
need to tell newbies and those who have had it for hears that the beast can be tamed.,
just wondering if its worth us forming a group so that little voice becomes louder.,
we could do it over the miles with modern technology.,
many of us have before and after pics and a story to tell.,
we could even write a book!,
jason fung eat your heart out!,
'we all reversed our diabetes'.,
we could maybe meet up even if its just a few of us.,
"local cafe, i can see it now.",
"'can i order the quiche salad please, i hope that wasnt made in a factory, can you take off all the pastry, i only want half a tomato, heavy on the cucumber and lettuce, sprinkle of onions.",
what!!!,
you only have low fat mayo!!!,
"but im on a diet and it has to be loaded with fat, fuller the better!!!",
"and please don't even mention jacket potatoes, oh well, while we are on that subject do you realise how many sugars there are in one of those....well let me tell you (queue forming benind and lots of tutting and blowing).",
a drink?,
"yes please, tripple shot coffee (unless you serve bullet proof!)",
with lashings of double cream.,
you might as well throw in 3 strawberries but not too big size wise.,
do i want chocolate on the top?,
if its 85 per cent yes if not can you throw on some flax seeds!!!!',
so im just asking you if you have any ideas or if you think its fighting a losing battle.,
any feedback welcomed!!!!!!,
shelley262 said: excellent thread @debandez well done you it takes some courage to put your story out there.,
count my three and a half stone in on the total tonnage lost on lchf and more importantly a drop from my diagnosis hbaca1 of 97 to 30 in may this year.,
lets go for it and raise awareness i would love to be involved however we go ahead happy to be involved either virtually initially - via this thread maybe interested people could link together in a group conversation to move it forward ?,
or via a meet up maybe somewhere central?,
count me in youre doing a great job click to expand...,
thanks for this.,
you are prime candidate @shelley262 with what you have achieved.,
great weight loss and wow to the drop in hna1c!!!,
impressive.,
i'm going to keep the details of the people interested and see what the take up is to start with.,
it feels good to be highlighting it any which way!,
xfieldok said: excellent article.,
i am still on meds but expect non diabetic hba1c at the end of the month.,
in may it was 35 and mysugr estimates 37 at the moment.,
after my test i will be discussing reducing my meds with the dn.,

you have done so well to get to non diabetic levels.,
well done.,
i'm going to collate names/details for now and see how much interest is shown.,
the more the merrier.,
thanks for your reply.,
bigsi1984 said: im in click to expand...,
brilliant.,
i'm collating info on volunteers and will see where it takes us.,
we could also see what our press office think carol43 said: i spread the word as much as i can.,
in sainsbury this morning i was looking for oppo ice cream (nothing).,
there was an elderly lady (i think older than me) looking for ice lollies with the lowest sugar because she told me she was t2 on insulin.,
in her trolley was a ready meal with rice and a box of battered fish.,
she said her dn had said she could have these things.,
click to expand... that makes me so sad and all the more detirmined to try and help change things in however small a way.,
not the patients fault or the dn!,
mbaker said: sometimes i think it is just me.,
the world over intelligent learned and trained persons are telling type 2's to effectively hasten complications; it more than beggars belief.,
click to expand...,
it's like they are all in on some master plan.,
mi5 mission possible.,
it really is strange.,
i'm sure some drs have t2d and know what's best.,
can't believe it is taking so long to get the message out there.,
it does seem to be filtering through that said.,
but way to slow.,
smw99 said: i read your story on a link from eat the butter i think.,
well done!,
"don't feel too discouraged because every time a story like this appears, it sews a seed.",
i get frustrated with slow progress towards giving low carb advice but we have to keep on taking small steps.,
things are changing!!,
click to expand...,
yes they are.,
seen the low carb programmes on tv.... articles in newspapers and magazines about how people have reversed it.,
you tube videos.,
books.,
studies (nd).,
social media and web sites.,
its happening.,
"rachox said: brilliant post debandez, im so frustrated by how slowly the nhs advice is catching up, if indeed it ever will?",
"also the poor knowledge amongst some health professionals is astounding a friend of mine was tested as pre diabetic on her hba1c over a year ago, the nurse advised weight loss, which she has had little success with at slimming world or it might be weight watchers, i glazed over when she told me, its one of the 2!",
"despite my banging on about how low carb would achieve two aims at once she carries on eating her daily treat of 5 foxes glacier fruits or a small packet of dolly mixtures which are allowed on her diet she asked her gp when she should get another hba1c when she was attending an appt for yet another infection, and he said no need, youre fine!",
"so she is now swanning along thinking shes ok. ive tried to advise her, shes seen my successes but trusts her dr, its so wrong anyway back to your proposal debandez, count me in!",
i have been approached by dajana from the press office too and am waiting to see if anything comes of it.,
i do hope so.,
"i love your caf scenario, ill smuggle in the adonis and phd bars for afters!",
i have car will travel as im a bit further south than blackpool!,
click to expand...,
yes we will certainly include desserts!,
i love an adonis bar.,
you're in lol.,
its a sorry state of affairs and if i wasn't living it i would not believe it!,
shocking is an understatement.,
"i saw my poor mum struggle along, getting worse by the week.",
more and more insulin.,
and still eating all the bad stuff.,
that was going back 20 years.,
hard to believe that bad advice is continuing!!!,
your friend is a prime example.,
drs word over someone's who has reversed it through lchf.,
we have a battle on our hands.,
thank you.,
xfieldok said: can i just put something out here for consideration.,
"it goes without saying that i am concerned about the dire advice given to newly diagnosed t2's, i am also worried about people on low incomes or benefits.",
"if you are unable to self fund a meter, how can you be expected to improve your situation?",
just a thought.,
click to expand... you are so right.,
i daren't add up how much it's cost me in 6 months in strips alone.,
i've actually moved from an option neo to a codefree to save money.,
it was costing over 10 for 50 to just over 5.,
i use 8 strips a day at least.,
a small fortune still being used but fortunately i can just about afford this luxury!,
i feel every diabetic should be supplied with the tools to self test at diagnosis.,
it would be costly but could avoid complications which are also very costly to the nhs.,
it could help keep people off meds and save billions.,
that said i wonder how many would use them.,
the advice being dished out needs to change to reflect the probable complications if lchf diet not followed!,
confirm how it would be progressive.,
more and more meds would be needed.,
i know people who think that taking the meds means they can still eat and drink what they want!,
more education required.,
"hi, i have been taking metformin for four or five weeks now and have had no bad reactions.",
i take 1000mg with breakfast and 500mg with dinner.,
"my bs is coming down very well and i had my first ""within normal"" reading today, two hours after breakfast.",
"however this afternoon, i have had quite bad diarrhoea, for the first time for as long as i can remember.",
"i have the same breakfast every day of rolled oats, a little portion of low gi fruit, some nuts, pumpkin seeds, cinnamon powder, mixed with milk and kefir (fermented milk).",
today my wife put in more milk and kefir than normal.,
does anyone know if milk or kefir can react with metformin?,
i cannot think of anything else that could cause such a reaction.,
"cheers #uart, the whole point of taking metformin is to help the liver deal with the sugar content of carbohydrates, which is why people take it on the first place!",
so to write that metformin reacts badly with carbohydrates is simply not true.,
"however there are some people who just cannot take metformin for different reasons, getting diarrhoea is one of them.",
"#uart if that was the case, no-one would be taking metformin!!",
"not only this, but i would have had diarrhoea for five weeks, as i have had the same breakfast every day for years now.",
"besides, i would never take the word of the dn on issues such as this.",
a good example of what not to believe is for example - that the official advice being given out on official diabetes health lines still advises diabetics that potatoes and bread are ok to eat....lol.,
"when i challenged the advisor on the veracity of what she was saying, she told me that she was just handing out official nice guidelines.",
"as far as you comments on what metformin does, that is just semantics.",
the function of metformin is to help the body control blood sugar.,
"i bought two brand new vials of humulin r on friday afternoon, and forgot to put it in the refrigerator right away... so they ended up lying in a paper bag on my bed (away from direct sunlight, though) until saturday morning, a few hours before dawn.",
"when i realized what i had done, i refrigerated them immediately.",
would my insulin have gone bad in that space of time?,
has anyone here experienced leaving an unopened vial unrefrigerated for any period of time?,
what happened to it?,
i seriously hope those two vials don't go to waste because of all this... this disease is frustrating enough.,
noblehead said: unrefrigerated insulin needs to be used up within 4 weeks.,
click to expand...,
regardless of whether it was opened or not?,
the vials are unopened - the boxes haven't even been opened yet.,
what about the length of time that it was unrefrigerated?,
would that not matter?,
i will not be using one of those unopened vials until the next month... and the other one won't be used until the following month.,
"noblehead said: doesn't matter if the boxes had been open or not, i suggest you read the patient information leaflet that comes with the insulin.",
click to expand... well i'm afraid i can't afford to go along with those guidelines...,
i will have to leave things the way they are and hope for the best.,
"i won't be able to use up those two vials within four weeks, and it's ridiculous that just because they were out of the refrigerator for a few hours, i now only have four weeks to use both of them.",
that makes no sense to me.,
i honestly feel like giving up on managing this disease.,
"too much bs... from now on, whatever happens, happens... is there anyone here who actually left out their unopened insulin for a few hours?",
"assuming that it wasn't thrown out, was there any notable difference in the way it worked when you finally started using it?",
carbsrok said: there's no need to shoot the messenger you will soon know if you have a problem as the potency will diminish thus you will need more insulin.,
perhaps read the patient leaflet enclosed with your insulin for more info!,
click to expand...,
"i am not shooting the messenger, and i am not sure why you would think that.",
i already read the leaflet.,
"i seek other information, preferably first-hand experiences with such a situation.",
carbsrok said: with respect rachel i read your post as having a go at @noblehead because you didn't like what you were reading.,
you also live in a different climate to people in the uk so yes you could run into major problems.,
there's only one way to find out if you have damaged your insulin by your mistake.,
click to expand... you misread my post.,
"it is possible for somebody to be frustrated about their current situation , and express that frustration, without ""having a go"" at someone.",
the insulin that i'm currently using has been lying around in my room for well over a week and it works just fine.,
and my room relies on a single fan to keep it from feeling like a sauna... *shrug* uart said: yeah the information on the leaflet doesn't really cover your particular circumstance specifically.,
"mine just says unopened safe storage life is 2 years, refrigerated at 2c to 8c, and that the subsequent usage life is 28 days, unrefrigerated less than 30c.",
personally i very much doubt that leaving it unrefrigerated for 10 to 12 hours during the evening would do anything too drastic.,
"i would use it as planned, but just keep an eye on it and take note if you feel it's not as effective as it should be.",
it will probably be fine though.,
btw.,
i notice that you're in a tropical region rachel.,
just how warm are the evenings there at the moment.,
i'm guessing around the 25 to 30c range.,
is that correct?,
click to expand...,
"i would estimate that in the evenings, temperatures are usually somewhere between 28-30c.",
temperatures would be slightly higher closer to midday - like around 31/32c... and at night/early morning it's nearer to 25/26c.,
can i ask whether any one taking misinform have ever had any side effect relating to aggression?,
"recently diagnosed as type 2 my gp has been upping my metformin until i am taking 4-5 per day, over the past couple of days however i have noticed that for no or very little reason i experience what i can only describe as pure rage...there is no 'build up' to this feeling and it seems to go the same way!",
i have an appointment in an hour or so and i know that he will up the dose from 3 to 4 today because the upset stomach is not as ofter now!,
...i am worried in case it is the medication that is causing this and wanted to ask whether that could be the case?,
"thanks for all of your comments i did mention the anger thing to the gp and he told me that it could possibly be a delayed shock to my original diagnosis (about six weeks ago) he went on to mention that when he told me that i had diabetes he was surprised because my reaction had been, yes...ok...right then so what happens next?",
and he said that because i have been having loads of appointments and medication he thinks that it has all finally clicked!,
he then upped my 3 x 40 mg metformin to two 1000mg of slow release and told me to make an appointment in two weeks time.,
ooooh flyerphil i'm scared :wink: finally got my meter today (refused by gp and so i bought my own) and yet again my incompetence is glaringly obvious!,
when i did a test two hours after eating food and it read 13.1mmol/l ?,
:?,
can anyone explain what this means in simple terms!,
ideally what should the bg be before and after food?,
also the diabetes nurse told me not to eat anything with more that 5g sugar in it per serving!,
the other thing that is bugging me is when low carbing just how many carbs should i ideally be eating per day?,
:crazy: i'm sorry for blabbing on but i am one of these people who like to know exactly what i should and shouldn't be doing etc from the onset!,
"i have an apartment with a dietitian later this month and a course with desmond in october, but until then i haven't had much advice apart from here.",
no!,
:shock: i don't have an apartment with the dietician .....i haven't moved in with him/her just out of laziness just so they can sort out my grub or anything!!!,
it's just a normal innocent appointment honestly :wink: :lolno:,
"hi everyone following on from my liver scan, resulting in a fatty liver, have been to docs today and also been told i have an enlarged spleen - it seems to be one thing after another at the moment and i'm starting to get really down about it all and panicking that i am on a downward spiral!",
would appreciate any information anyone has on enlarged spleen and whether it is related to diabetes.,
hope someone can help :cry: hi karen yes feeling pretty rubbish at the moment.,
was too shocked to ask questions because i knew about fatty liver (told me at scan) but not spleen so it was a bolt out of the blue!,
doc wasn't sure whether enlarged spleen was normal with liver (which she said was pretty fatty!),
as she hadn't come across this before so she is writing to the liver consultant at local nhs trust to ask for information/guidance unfortunately i don't know how long this is going to take.,
"burst into tears at work because i read a bit on internet (can be very dangerous) and directed me to hodgkins disease/cancer/all nasty things and once you start looking at symptoms for something they always seem to match what you have however reassured by your post, so thanks for that.",
bg usually around 8.3 in the morning - only test once per day at the moment unless really high in the morning (if i have succumbed to a sweet and sour chicken).,
due to see dietician next week for first time so that could be interesting with all the different problems i have.,
i'm on metformin 2 x 500 per day.,
"only diagnosed about 8 weeks ago and then bg was only 11.5 at highest which, having read a lot of threads, seems quite low compared with others on the forum.",
i am so glad that i found this website and forum because sometimes there is no-one else to ask and if like me you are in shock it is not until later that you think about what you should have asked.,
i think i will have to wait until doc has heard from specialist but if i haven't heard in 10 days will make appt as you say and go and see her because when i asked what i needed to do she said nothing until we have heard back.,
sorry about the long post but so good to be able to 'talk' to someone about it.,
thanks again chris thank you so much for your encouraging and caring reply - had to get the tissues out again!,
not really low carbing as i should but will really put my mind and heart into it now!,
as you say i shouldn't worry before anything happens but i think today was just the culmination since diagnosis - think it has properly hit me now about being diabetic whereas before i don't think it had really sunk in.,
thanks so much for your advice - will put into practice and be patient.,
will let you know how i get on.,
thanks again chris just to update anyone reading this thread i have taken karen's advice and reduced carbs by about 2/3 rather than go cold turkey and take out all carbs and since doing that today bg 6.9 this am and just tested now and down to 6.0 so i am well chuffed.,
am also feeling a lot more positive than i did on friday and a lot of that is thanks to karen's posts.,
am seeing dietician for first time on thursday so will see what she says - although from reading most threads i can expect to be told to eat carbs till they are coming out of my ears however seen results with my own eyes (and meter) so am going to carry on with what i am doing.,
also hope this will help me to lose weight as definitely in very top end of overweight.,
will post again after i have seen the dietician :wink: chris just an update if anyone still viewing this thread have heard from specialist and he wanted loads more blood tests doing and has asked me (via my gp) loads of questions about whether i have had blood transfusions etc in the past.,
anyway have had the blood tests and am now waiting for a clinic appointment for a liver biopsy :cry: :cry: still worried sick about this but trying to keep positive.,
at least i know i can come on to the forum and have a good winge without being shouted at :lol: cj thanks for the encouraging replies guys.,
have definitely been down over the last week and haven't felt up to much in the way of posting and the chat room.,
it is very difficult to be positive when one thing after another keeps cropping up.,
i will post when i have seen the consultant and let you know how i have gone on.,
will be putting some pressure on to get an early appt so i don't have to wait too long :!,
": thanks for the liver trust website sarah i have seen it but will have another look and also look at the low carbing one, thanks trinkwasser hi i've very little pain at the moment and not from spleen side but from liver side.",
have got date for appt with specialist now - 30 december - happy new year eh cj hi to anyone who reads this thread update - have seen said specialist this morning and what a nice bloke he was too.,
anyway upshot is nothing to worry about (after worrying for last six weeks!).,
spleen not really enlarged and although have got fatty liver i am already doing the right things to sort it out so he was really encouraging and i just feel great now - what a great end to what has been a really tough year.,
anyway happy new year to all!,
cj :wink:,
"hi all, as a t2 on metformin and a low carb diet should i see bg testing below 4mmol?",
i have recently had a reading of 4.1mmol which i know is great and and very pleased about having been in the high teens at diagnosis in march this year (and once a belting 22.9mmol after a substantial easter sunday lunch!),
but was just wondering if below 4mmol is problematic or even right for a t2 to see?,
i read that diabetics shouldn't drive at these levels and also metformin isn't a drug that lowers bg substantially.,
my t1 friend considers readings in the 3's to be time to act to avoid her having hypos.,
"any thoughts would be much appreciated, thanks thanks doll helensaramay said: a couple of things to consider - people with diabetes sometimes get bg below 4.0 - our meters are not 100% accurate so a reading of 3.5 may actually be higher than 4.0 due to the meter errors.",
"click to expand... great thanks @helensaramay dcukmod said: mikeyj, provided you aren't on any strong meds, then t2s managed by lifestyle can see numbers under 4.",
"i certainly do, and most days.",
"obviously, if you feel concerned, see your health care team, and if you feel unwell, then you could try having something simple like a cup of tea with milk.",
that's usually enough to just nudge the numbers back into a comfort zone.,
"for anyone on stronger meds, then the approach would be quite different.",
click to expand...,
"thanks mod, useful to know, i wasn't feeling unwell just wasn't sure if it was unusual or cause for concern.",
this is a helpful forum.,
p.s.,
i saw it as a good excuse to have a beer (liquid bread!),
but tea is a sensible suggestion thanks @bluetit1802 you're right but sometimes 'man gotta live!',

"thank you @rhubarb73 sound advice my friend resurgam said: not advisable with metformin - it is on the leaflet included in the box - your liver is already being restricted in its operation by the drug, adding in alcohol would be somewhat problematic.",

i appreciate your advice though.,
i wasnt feeling well and went to the doctors today.,
i feel really tired and thirsty.,
i had my sugar level checked and it was 4.2.,
the doctor said this is fine but a friend has told me i am borderline for diabetes.,
what do think?,
"hello, i found out i had type 2 diabetes in 2005.",
ive been taking oral medication since about 2008 (metfromin and simvastatin).,
i have been suffering the following symptoms for the last couple of years and im wondering if it is related to the diabetes or the medication im taking.,
i get a stinging sensation at the end of my penis as if i have been peeing diluted acid and it's driving me mad because it affects my sleep all night.,
once i am awake and out of bed i am less aware of the irritation and burning/stinging sensation as it is less severe for some reason.,
it usually lasts for a few days and then disappears for a few days before i get it again.,
its so frustrating as the irritation is not severe but just enough to irritate and affect my sleep.,
its really beginning to affect my job as im always tired.,
the other thing i think is worth mentioning is that i have lost about 10lb in the last 6 weeks.,
i know its not a urine infection nor is it related to a lack of hygiene.,
i was just wondering if anyone else has been suffering with these symptoms and if it is related to diabetes.,
best regards,
"hi everyone i have had type 2 diabetes for about 15 years now and i've been suffering from terrible neuropathy in my feet which, to anyone who doesn't know, is like someone with a knife stabbing my feet all night.",
i am not able to get enough sleep and i'm reluctant to keep taking the painkillers all the time but i am still working so i need to be able to function for a day at work.,
is there anyone out there in the diabetes community that has suffered this as well?,
"for the last 5 months i've had my blood sugars very controlled and i'm exercising as well i just want to know will the pain ever go, or at least lessen so that i can cope.",
my life is so blighted by the pain that it's ruining the quality of my life and the doctors say that i'm on the pills i should be but they do not help in any way.,
please help me someone!,
thanks for listening to me.,
art of flowers said: high blood sugars cause neuropathy.,
the best way to reduce high blood sugars is through a low carb diet.,
pills such as metformin are not much help in reducing high blood sugar.,
"you need to get a blood glucose monitor to test your blood sugars before and two hours after meals to see which foods spike your blood sugars, best to avoid high carb foods such as breakfast cereals, bread, potatoes, rice and pasta and avoid fruit juice and fruit such as bananas and grapes.",
alpha lipoic acid is effective in reducing neuropathy.,
a vitamin b12 deficiency can also cause neuropathy.,
metformin can cause b12 deficiency.,

thanks for your advice.,
"i will look into this ala. freema said: well dear it is such a devastating condition .. not much is helping this condition... but some do have help from the r-alpha-lipoic-acid at least 600mg daily , here is where i have found them the cheapest at ""apo-rot"" a german but very reliable web-pharmacy shop,where i buy them for my mother , it takes 3-5 days to get them from the ordering time : https://www.apo-rot.co.uk/index_sea...ext=frey+nutrition+alpha-lipons%c4ure+kapseln (it is important that it is the r-form of the alpha lipoic acids = r-alpha-lipoic-acid ) another thing that might help is to have optimal levels of vitamin b 12 all the time... as too low levels of vitamin b 12 can actually be the cause of neuropathy.. eating cherries is helping inflamation in the body and so are blueberries... and dark chokolade (sugar free high condensed chokolade) : https://www.bulkpowders.co.uk/organic-cacao-liquor-buttons.html also try 200gram horse radish chopped in 0.5 liter red wine for 10 days and then , kept in fridge , and then start the day with one-two teaspoons daily on an empthy stomack, it taste very heavily of the herb , it is a traditional natural recepi used to pain cramps and odemas (it is not scientifically proven ... but maybe worth a try anyways and not very expensive ) click to expand...",

would love the forums thoughts on using 1 glass of red wine with a main meal as a means to reduce blood sugar levels.,
"i am type 2, 500mg metformin a day.",
i have noticed my blood sugar levels can be kept low with a glass of red wine.,
i eat well but the red wine makes a big difference.,
i have read that red wine can stop the liver from turning protein into glucose.,
"if that is true and it appears to be according to my very unscientific tests, then what are the down sides to 1 glass of red with my main meal.",
i know the wine industry would recommend it but what about everyone else ???,
what a fine bunch you all are if only my doctor had such knowledge and humour.,
i'm off to sink a glass.,

note: i'm in the us and converted these numbers for all of you so hopefully i didn't make an error: total cholesterol- 5.8 (december 2nd) to 4.4 (april 25th) calculated ldl- 3.6 to 2.4 hdl- 1.6 to 1.2 risk ratio- 2.29 to 1.96 triglycerides- 1.49 to 1.1 a1c also went from 42.1 down to 35.5 notes about my diet: -i do not regulate my saturated fats and my fridge has 30+ pounds of meat in it.,
"-i eat less than 50g of carbs a day and currently around 30-35g -i have a very high protein intake of around 200-250g a day (1g+ per pound of body weight) -i eat a ton of chicken and lean meats, but also things like bacon and cheese.",
-my total cholesterol had stayed in the 5.8 range for about 2 years until most recently.,

thank you very much for some very informative replies.,
i do test on a regular basis and recently the only time it has got anywhere near 7.8 was the other night when i got up too 8.8 for a few hours after having a non creamy curry with rice and nan bread.,
the nan bread was my first foray into white flour since being diagnosed.,
"my eating has changed drastically, my (deliberate) sugar eating must be 3 or 4 % what it was, i try and eat healthy fats, white bread and pastries etc which were once my staples have disappeared.",
and so on.,
"but i still eat mash, brown bread (up to four slices a day), bananas, grapes, (fruit is a new experience to my body) and various other things that i read others on here avoiding like the plague.",
but my test strips hardly go above 7.,
"i was worried that eating these foods might be damaging me, even though blood sugars are somehow staying low, but it seems to be that as long as the bg count stays healthy the underlying symptoms of diabetes have more chance of being kept at bay.",
i am also on metformin.,
"but there is no harm in knowing, and avoiding, foods if their 'tax' is not parallel to the enjoyment.",
"for example i would not now have a banana, i enjoy a juicy apple nearly as much so i will take the apple.",
"but if i was to have a ham sandwich i would not consider swapping the bread for, say, some salad and making it into a ham salad.",
bread does have a tax to enjoyment ratio that is worth it.,

"catherinecherub said: hi darrell, you asked for an explanation of the hba1c test.",
this link below will tell you.,
"http://medweb.bham.ac.uk/easdec/prevent ... _hba1c.htm as carty explained so well, you cannot follow what someone else is eating and think that your blood sugars will follow the same path as them.",
it is an individual thing and you have to rely on your meter to see what is suitable for you.,
"in the early stages it is wise to test, test, test.",
you may also find that if you add somethings to your meals as opposed to snacking on them that this will mean that you can eat that fruit that you thought was out of bounds.,
do not follow others blindly thinking they have found the secret.,
they may have found the secret for them but it does not mean that it will be right for you.,

can diabetic patients get cannabis subscribed in the uk ?,

"i smoke every day (after work ) 1 or 2 joints a night and decided to stop for one month to see how i was when i didn't smoke , and the result was very dramatic , when i smoke my sugar levels are between 5-8 all say every day , when i didn't smoke they was between 10-13 all day every day , i found that my apitite was none exaistant when not smoking and when i did eat i just felt tired and lazy , so now i have smoked again for a not h and my sugar levels are back down to what they should be !",
and i'm no tired and i'm eating well again !,

also i don't drink at all but have found in previous years when i did have the odd one or 2 beers i found the next day was a rite off for me lol any just my opinion i shall stick to what works best for me and that's a joint or 2 a day keeps the doctor away !!!,
p.s stay away from the space cakes not cause of the cannabis but because of the cake !!,
"i have done a bit of research on cannabis and diabeties , in the uk people see cannabis as a hard drug when in reality it's not at all , alcohol is in fact far worse for you , in america you can actually get subscribed cannabis through diabeties as it helps your appetite and takes a whole lot of pressure of your eyes !",
"if you look into cannabis you will see it really isn't that bad and can do wonders for all sorts of people if it was that bad it wouldn't be subscribed to over 10 different types of illnesses , and legal in many many many places in the world as log as you don't over use and become a bum i feel it's a good thing to help you along in life if you need it.",
"it's only addictive if u have an addictive personality and will only do u harm if your silly about it , like all things use in moderation !",
"because i eat a lot of healthy foods i dont indulge in chocolates or cakes or junk food although i would love to lol also not to bore you all or keep going on , when the diagnosed me i thought i had to stop smoking as it would really effect y diabeties bearing in mid i had no idea about diabeties at all, but my first 2 months of not smoking my sugar levels was hi all the time then i i started again and then i felt great my sugar levels dropped and my energy was up as i was back at work in no time !",

i will eat some veg with a roast dinner as long as i have roast potatoes to eat with it and covered in gravy.,
salads i only eat when i have a bbq it's not something i could eat everyday or once a week/month etc.,
i have seen a dietician and went on a course for a few hours to carb count which i didn't totally understand but use a book to help with that.,

hi all last aprii i was diagnosed type 2 following a visit to my heal centre for a 'well man' clinic.,
the subsequent glucose test along with an hba1c showed my level at 63.0 mmol.mol.,
on a retinal scan traces of diabetes were found but only level r1.,
since then through diet and limiting/reducing my sugar intake i have lost about 6/7kg in weight and my average blood sugar level has been reduced from 6.23 last april to 5.57 at the end of august.,
"this was established using free style lite testing strips which i used once each day before meals varying each day between pre-breakfast, pre-lunch and pre-dinner.",
"this week i had a second hba1c test which confirmed my level at 56 mmol.mol which, according to the information i have obtained online, in non-diabetic.",
"that said, my gp who specialises in diabetes recommends that i start taking one metformin tablet each day to further reduce my hba1c level ideally to 50.",
"unless it is necessary, i don't really wish to start taking continual medication and would prefer control being by diet and excercise.",
"my question is, should i follow my gp's advice ?",
i would really appreciate peoples thoughts.,
many thanks from a newbie diabetic !,
"julifriend said: sorry if i'm mis-reading this, but based on the who guidelines as shown on this page --> http://www.diabetes.co.uk/what-is-hba1c.html an hba1c of 56 is in the t2 range.",
if i understand it correctly you'd have to be below 42 to be in the non-diabetic range.,
"that said, with control of your diet and exercise it should be possible to reduce your levels to the target your doctor has set and even below that.",
"on diagnosis, my hba1c was 62.",
"four months later after removing sugar, sweets, cakes, biscuits and crisps from my diet and with 40 minutes moderate walking daily, my hba1c was down to 38.",
click to expand... hi i may be totally wrong or misinterpreting what i am reading but looking at 'diagnosing diabetes' http://medweb.bham.ac.uk/easdec/prevent ... _hba1c.htm it states diagnosing diabetes diabetes may be defined as having an hba1c>6.5% (pulse 2010).,
"so, >6.5% = diabetes <6.0% = not diabetic in between....6.0-6.5...may be this is 'pre-diabetes' or 'at risk of diabetes'.",
"i'm pressuming possibly wrongly, that the <6.0% means blood sugar level (bsl) less than 6.0% means not diabetic.",
my haa1c level was 56 which equates to my bsl average when self testing.,

does anyone use a mini fridge to store their insulin?,
i am moving back in to university halls to do my pgce and i don't want to keep my insulin in the shared kitchen.,
i have just bought an argos mini fridge but i am dubious to use it after reading the guide.,
does anybody else use these?,
"sent from the diabetes forum app i think it's cool enough but it says it cools 20-25 degrees below ambient temp, so i'm worried this could drop below 5 degrees!",
as they cool based on the room temp it's not a constant temp which worries me and was wondering if anyone had us experience with it.,

i normally take 11 units at bed and 4 units of levemir around 11am.,
today i took 11 units in the morning by accident.,
so i had 11 units last night and 11 units this morning.,
this is 7 units over my normal dose.,
i am not sure what to do as this is the first time i have misdosed my basal insulin (i was actually hypo when i took the injection - so not thinking straight!!),
do you carry on with your bolus injections as normal and would you take the full basal dose tonight if at all or a reduced dose?,
thanks goji thanks ebony321 and snodger for your replies i was very worried after i took the wrong amount but so far things have been fine - with no hypos.,

hi everyone hope you are all as well as can be :lol: i wonder if anyone else has been told that bd micro-fine 4mm pen needles are being withdrawn or if it is just a decision that has been made by my doctors' practice alone.,
on friday i went to collect two repeat prescription items one of which being the aforementioned needles.,
the pharmacist (i collect at my doctors' practice) gave me one item and when i said that i had also requested pen needles she said that only one item had been ordered i assured her that i knew i had ordered two items.,
"after about 10 minutes she decided to check the online system and informed me that the needles had been withdrawn, i thought she meant withdrawn from my prescription personally.",
i was rather alarmed because i thought how am i going to inject without needles.,
what she actually meant was that this brand of needles are not going to be prescribed anymore because of cost and are being replaced by cheaper ones.,
surprise.,
however because the person who data entered my request did not over ride the system the new needles weren't ordered.,
i was told that i would have to wait until next week to allow the system to be over ridden.,
i said this was unacceptable.,
cutting a long story short i stood my ground and the pharmacist found some of my usual needles in a cupboard which she allowed me to have.,
my concern now is is this going to happen next time?,
i queried this point because obviously my repeat prescription still states the discontinued brand.,
i have been told it will be okay.,
"thanks for any thoughts or knowledge regarding this i'm like you paul 1976 i get on well with them, but if what you say is right xaoifex than that will be ok. do you know why the change of name?",

"just a quick query - what is the ""normal"" levemir dosage ?",
"reason i ask is that i started injecting in december after 10 yrs on tablets, and feeling **** all the time.",
since starting injecting ( and stopping avandia and metformin ) i feel a whole lot better .,
i was advised by my dn to start at 10 units and increase by 2 until my morning count (fbg?),
was 7.,
guess what ?,
3 months on and my ffing bbing gee is now up around 12 and i'm injecting 22 units every evening.,
is 22 units normal ?,
common to be more perhaps ?,
weight is 14st 3lbs and has risen by a stone over the last year or two.,
pete not keen at all on going back to metformin - it was imho making me feel **** all the time.,
i inject last thing at night and test fbg first thing in the morning - maybe 8hrs difference - shouldn't that produce a lower fbg ?,
"thanks for you reply btw..... b-) many thanks to you all for your advice, which i will be acting upon immediately by upping my dosage for this week to 24 units and gradually increasing every week.",
i just needed the reassurance that i am on the right track.,
pete an update to my previous condition..... started the low carb diet last week and immediately my fbg dropped to the 4-7 range !!!,
i'm absolutely delighted .,
"my weight is also dropping, and lost 5 maybe 6lbs in a week (2 sets of scales thus different reading although both calibrated correctly).",
medical checks due this week and i will take advice on dosage considering the success of the dietary control method.,
hope that i will be decreasing the dosage going forward.,
anotehr update - i attended the 3 month checkup the other day & showed the latest results in graphical form highlighting the fbg stabilising only after starting the low carb diet.,
"i then queried the insulin dosage & was advised i could start dropping it until the fbg came around 7 - my current 4s are too low...... b-) also, was advised that i should inject at the same time every night (10pm for me) and possibility of dropping two of the tablets which i currently take.",
so for me the objective has been achieved....... control by diet.....,

"hoping someone can help please, many thanks in advance.",
totto said: depends on what kind of blood test.,
if a test shows your bg is high it is likely you have diabetes and they will order further tests to confirm the diagnosis.,
if you only do a fasting blood test and it comes back normal you can't use it to say diabetes is ruled out.,
"the most reliable test is the ogtt, oral glucose tolerance test, where you first check fasting bg, the drink 75 grams of glucose and then test after two hours to see how your body copes with that amount of sugar.",
i was tested at one hour too.,
click to expand...,
thank you for your reply.,
"the doctor ordered a blood test - i didn't have to fast - and when it came back she ran through the results, saying my blood sugar was ok so i didn't have diabetes, but i thought i remembered reading somewhere that a true blood test for diabetes will mean that you fast beforehand?",
totto said: then it was a hba1c test also known as long-time sugar.,
not too reliable but does give an inkling.,

"stupid question, i'm sure, but i've noticed (but only since i was diagnosed as a type 2 :lol: ) that within a few minutes of eating a piece of wholemeal toast (or just about any other carb-laden food), i experience a slight light-headedness/unusual feeling in my head.",
"if i eat more, say two slices, i can experience a form or ringing in the ears that last about 20 mins.",
is this a symptom of diabetes?,
does the carb convert to glucose and enter the blood stream that quickly?,
any thoughts?,
re: how long does it take for a piece of toast to be digeste hi charon thank you for your helpful reply.,
i thought that this was unlikely.,
i have cut down dramatically on sugar / carbs.,
"on the sugar side, i have totally stopped eating or drinking anything that has sugar (sucrose, glucose syrup, fructose syrup etc)amongst its ingredients.",
i have also reduced carbohydrates to a comparatively low level (most days not more than 100 gm total).,
"now eating lots of salads, vegetables, some fruit (berries, pears)fish, very lean meat, nuts.",
bread - but not more than 2 slices per day (always rye bread or very course wholegrain).,
exercising daily (brisk walking and some cycling).,
need to up this (but still a bit lazy).,
i've been on this regime since shortly after diagnosis (end of april 13) but do now find that i feel hungry most of the time.,
i think this is because i am also trying to keep fats intake down.,
my bg levels are not particularly high (within nice guidelines for t2s most of the time) but i want to do better than nice if i can.,
re: how long does it take for a piece of toast to be digeste this has turned into a really interesting thread.,

all a bit confusing.,
"so far just the numbers from the doctor's receptionist with no interpretation at all, so difficult to make sense.",
any ideas?,
thanks for all previous suggestions.,
"hi, well i had a quick chat with a gp from my surgery who confirmed that i was on the borderline between impaired glucose tolerance testing and diabetes.",
"however, he said he was sure things would improve wiht diet and exercise.",
"the trouble is, i weigh less than 8 stone already!",
"i've lost more than 10kg since this whole thing started, and really don't think i can afford to lose anymore.",
he then said that things would undoubtedly improve when i came off steroids.,
"again, probably true, but i've been on steroids continuously for about 10 years now (since i was 21) due to pretty severe asthma, and there is no chance of coming off them in the near future.",
"so, all in all a bit odd.",
and i'm still left losing weight all the time!,
oh well.,
hopefully someone will sort me out eventually.,
"don't know if this is actually diabetes related or not, fingers crossed it isn't, but someone might have an idea what it could be.",
since last wednesday i have had a bit of a funny feeling on my right foot.,
"it's on the ball of my foot towards my big toe, on the fleshy pad before the big toe starts.",
it feels as though i should have a blister or a lump or a bit of hard skin there but i haven't got anything there at all and there is no redness or signs of anything being wrong.,
"it's not painful, either to touch or walk on but when walking it feels like i have something stuck under my foot.",
"as though there is something in my shoe, i'm walking on the stitching of my sock or i have a bit of something stuck on my foot.",
"my intital thought was that i've done something while i've been running or cycling, pulled something or got the start of a blister, but it doesn't feel like an injury.",
i don't really notice it when i don't have any weight on my foot but as soon as i get up and walk around i get the feeling again.,
"as i said i get no pain with it and it doesn't feel sore or swollen, just a bit of an irritation.",
as far as i am aware i don't have any problems with my feet so hopefuly it isn't diabetes related but i always worry about the start of neurpoathy.,
if anyone can shed any light on what it could be i'd be grateful.,
thanks for the replies.,
i had my feet up last night reading a book (pumping insulin as i go on a pump in september) and i never noticed the problem at all.,
similarly in bed last night i didn't notice the problem.,
this morning around the house i felt it a bit and walking in to work i noticed it again but not as bad as usual.,
i called the podiatrist yesterday and i'm waiting for them to call me back today to have a chat and possibly make an appointment.,
as it happens i have had gout once in this foot in the past but that was painful and hot to touch and this isn't.,
i have also had a few problems with shoes as well with this foot but i put that down to bad fitting shoes.,
also i had to put a pair of 'sorbothane' insoles into my running shoes and put an extra bit of padding under the arch to relieve the pressure i was getting on the ball of my foot but again this pressure from running made the ball of my foot tender and sore which it isn't now.,
"i have type2 diabetes which is reasonably controlled by statins & metformin tablets,the only trouble i get is at night,i can sit/lie in bed & watch t.v or read a book for a few hours & be perfectly fine but as soon as i lower my adjustable bed & relax ready to go to sleep i get this tingly,itchy feeling in my feet which drives me crazy & stops me going to sleep because i have to rub/bang my feet together to try stop the itching which can last up to 3 or 4 hours at a time,this has been getting worse the last week & i have been getting out of bed so as not to disturb my wife & i have been playing games on my computer until the wee small hours instead of sleeping,i used to get this before but i found that a visit ( or two) to the loo solved my problem but the past week nothing has helped!!",
is this common amongst diabetics & if so how can i prevent this from happening??,
as i need sleep more than solitaire on my computer!,

"in the last two years some terrible life stresses have caused my type2 to worsen, and although diet controlled for years my doctor wanted me to try metformin.",
"we started at 500mg slow release, and after three months i was pretty sick and miserable, nevertheless we increased it to 750mg, and within a month i had to stop.",
"i had exhaustion, nausea and overwhelming malaise.",
worst of all was the smell.,
everything tasted and smelled of rotten cabbages.,
"food, coffee, wine, and me, my body, sweat, aargh.",
i know other people have suffered these sort of side effects so my question is: when does it stop?,
three weeks later the smell is still with me.,
"food is inedible and weirdly, i can't smell anything else - not perfume or normal scents at all.",
getting a bit desperate here.,
"incidentally he has now given me glipimide, and i am afraid to take it.",
i am beginning to think this just has to be a long term recovery.,
"my energy is coming back, and the nausea is gone, but i still have bowel urgency and the taste/ smell alterations.",
"my friend took steroids for a period and had major side effects, she was told that it takes as long to recover from side effects as she took the drug for.",
i am hoping that after taking metformin for four months the effects will completely disappear after four months.,
"if anyone checks this thread for information, i think i may have dealt with this problem.",
i read that diabetics on metformin have only 25% of normal levels of folic acid.,
i know that my family have unusually high folic acid requirements (doctor told me years ago).,
so i am taking high dose folic acid.,
odd taste is almost gone after three days.,
coincidence?,
probably.,
"hi everyone im looking for some lower carb breakfast suggestions i usually eat two slices of toast but im not to happy with my bgs afterwards im also a picky eater i hate eggs so no suggestions with eggs please guzzler said: keto porridge, recipe available on dietdoctor.com.",

click to expand... @guzzler best to avoid it completely for me as ive had tachycardia and my dr says to stay off caffeine completely,
"as the title say, is there a survival plan if you run out due to exceptional circumstances, i have heard of one guy who only had a weeks supply of insulin when he got trapped in a flood while visiting his relatives and one guy who became seriously ill when trapped in his car on the m6 during the last snowstorm.",
"if you are ever stuck, whats the best plan ?",
revert to a pre insulin diet as used before 1921 or is there a more scientific method ?,
"some interesting points raised, rationing out your insulin is one way of doing it, avoiding food that will raise your blood is another option.",
i am surprised that there is no official guideline on this.,
"hi after recent blood tests, i have been told my vitamin d levels are low.",
i bought some high strength tablets from boots 12ug strength.,
does anyone know what this is in units as apparently i should be taking between 1000 and 2000 units a day.,
is this right.,
"thanks avi hi i was told i could have prescription ones but they taste horrible apparently, my choice, but didn't realise that bought ones come in various strengths and with various measurements.",
"was told seven seas one were the best but the price of these in boots, i just bought there own brand.",
they say high strength 12.5 ug.,
"avi hi well problem solved, went to docs to pick up prescription of test strips and they decided to give me a prescription of adcal-d3 anyway, ready and waiting for me.",
"i'm to take two a day and they are chewable, hence the taste, they contain 10 micrograms of vit d3.",

to date i have controlled my t2 via diet then about a month ago the soles of both feet became uncomfortable.,
now i find that my left foot is particularly very tender on the ball/arch.,
the diet nurse said there is nothing to worry about but it is now uncomfortable to walk.,
has anyone experienced the same problem ?,
"thanks for your input, i am due to see my dr this week.",
it will be interesting to see what he thinks.,
i'll let you know how i get on.,
let me know how you get on with your follow up appt.,
"hi jane, yes i do take 20mg of simvistatin i wonder if this is the problem?",
i'll ask my gp.,

i do hope the sore feet go away soon.,
thankyou for the information is was very much appreciated.,
i hope life is easier for you now.,
"hi jane, may i ask a question?",
"when you came off statins did you have any short term reactions, like tiredness and aching ?",
obviously you don't have to answer reply but i was just wondering.,
thanks just an update i came off statins 26 days ago and i am starting to feel much better except for the ringing in one ear.,
"is this another effect of taking simvistatin, do i now have to suffer tinnitus for ever ?",
now into february and my left foot still hurting and at night both the soles of my feet feel extremely taut.,
i am lost for what course of action to take or do i just wait and see !,

did anyone watch motor mouth katie hopkins ..my fat life....she gained nearly 4 stone eating junk food and loads of it to try and prove that obese people do get fat because of what they eat and can loose weight just by excercise and diet so the next step is to loose the weight she put on had to agree with a lot of what she said especially when she went out to the us to see what they were eating and it seems the obese just live on fast food the bigger and greasier the food is the more of it they eat she was actually reduced to tears when she saw two children eating the food in the diner as she could see how they would end up overweight.,
she was told by a harley street specialist that at 8st 10lb her normal weight that she was a bit underweight but was extremely fit.,
just like i mentioned on a thread a while ago when you are skinny it is much easier to loose to much weight than to gain it and she had not reckoned on that and found it really difficult and when she finally began to gain the weight it mostly went on her tummy she relies on her twisted view of life to earn a living as she is talentless.,
let's not forget insulin resistance.,
"following the nhs plenty-o-carbs eatwell plate will lead to weight gain, carb cravings and more weight gain for people with insulin resisitance.",
"not a fan or follower of this person ....i was aware of this food experiement ......but do not in theory support it at all andy williams said: some overweight people are that way because of beyond their control things such as psychological problems, certain medical conditions or the side effects of certain medications.",
"the vast bulk of overweight people however are overweight because they eat rubbish, they eat far to much and/or they are physically lazy.",
did anyone watch benefits:to fat to work?,

yes i watched that,
for about 15 years i've had the symptoms of feeling really hungry very often and becoming weak and shaky and faint if i don't eat.,
"i can't miss meals and struggle if i don't get to eat when i need to, as well as trying to manage my weight.",
"unfortunately i don't have an official diagnosis as the doctors have been completely useless in diagnosing anything, though they are keen to tell me it isn't diabetes.",
i've done finger prick blood tests which didn't seem to get any results.,
"i've seen nutritionists who couldn't recommend anything remotely helpful other than the most basic ""try and eat healthily"" (well, obviously!",
"), and i even did a test where i had a morning appointment with the gp who got me to drink a glucose drink before eating that day.",
"they tell me the results don't yield anything, but the symptoms persist and it's really debilitating.",
i don't know what else to do.,
eating healthily is difficult and expensive.,
i have insomnia (though very rarely do i wake up hungry).,
"i've been advised to eat things like porridge for breakfast, but that actually makes my symptoms worse (other cereals are better - ironically as is something like a fried breakfast, but i don't have those if very very rarely for obvious reasons).",
"i could go back to the gp but so far they've been worse than useless, and our service locally is suffering due to cuts.",
"the first doctor i spoke to just said, in respect of managing, scoff a packet of biscuits if you're busy.",
"clearly that's bad advice, but if anyone can relate to what i'm saying i'd be grateful, thanks.",
catapillar said: do you know it's blood sugar related?,
have you tested your blood sugar levels when you are having these symptoms?,
@lamont d might have some info on reactive hypoglycaemia for you.,

"they couldn't seem to diagnose anything and just decided that they would call it 'funcitonal' hypoglycemia, but that was only becaus ethey coudln't find anything else.",
it was all very confusing and i've been left ever since with no answers.,

@daisy1 will post some really useful information.,

"click to expand... no, i have had no real dietary advice and wouldn't know what to eat for a low carb diet.",
"i'd give it a go, but i don't have a lot of options when it comes to buying food.",
also i have a lot of foods i just don't like so replacing carbs would be difficult.,
"i'd give it a try if possible, but i don't know where to look.",
whenever i've looked into diets all i've found are fancy recipes with weird ingredients that are expensive or hard to get.,

"bluetit1802 said: there are some low carb breads available (bergen, lifelife, lidl high protein rolls).",
cereals you don't need.,
"have eggs for breakfast, cooked any which way you like them, even with bacon, mushrooms and tomatoes.",
or maybe a plain full fat yogurt with a few raspberries or strawberries added.,
there are plenty of options and plenty of ideas on this forum.,

(and i'm one of those).,
"follow some of the link we have given you, read, and you will see what i mean.",

"thanks, what about home baked bread?",
aren't these low carb breads really expensive (the gluten free stuff is really dear).,
"eggs every day can't be healthy surely, they're really high fat and cholestorol.",
i'm a couple of stone overweight and trying to lose it.,
i hate being fat.,
"besides, when i eat eggs (admittedly with toast) i don't find them filling at all and, like porridge, feel hungry quite soon after.",
i just don't know what you'd replace things like bread/starch with?,
"azure said: before you change your diet, it might be helpful to get some actual figures.",
you've mentioned an oral glucose test above (the glucose drink) - what was the result of that?,
"you've also mentioned finger prick tests - again, what numbers did you get?",
bear in mind that some people do feel weak and strange if they go too long without eating.,
what would be helpful would be if you could give some actual figures.,
do you have your own blood glucose meter so you can check what your blood sugar is when you're feeling weak?,
"if you can give some info about that, and what you've eaten, that might help click to expand...",
i don't recall being given an actual result of the glucose drink.,
"they just said, iirc, there was nothing.",
i don't remember the numbers of the finger prick tests though i recall a couple were in the range they gave me.,
but again it didn't really lead anwhere so i guess they thought it wasn't anything unusual.,
it was a long time ago.,
"i can try and get a blood glucose meter, if they aren't too expensive.",
i don't have a lot of disposable cash.,
"what i normally eat is cereal for breakfast, though notsomuch porridge as i've said, sandwiche for lunch and then for dinner usually chicken with rice/noodles of some kind, and vegetables some fresh some slightly cooked.",
afterwards i'll eat an apple or a banana with some fruit yoghurt.,
but inbetween i get hungry and struggle to snack on anything healthy.,
i can't snack on fruit because it just sets me off.,
so it either tends to e candy or cripsbread type stuff with cheese.,
i eat a lot of that.,
"lamont d said: hi, i was told by many that porridge is so good it would help with all my problems.",
it was the worst thing to eat because porridge or any grains rocketed my blood glucose levels.,
"carbs by any names, slow release, complex, healthy, and so on.",
"carbs regardless of label are lethal for me, as are cereals, bread, potatoes, pasta, and more!",
you will have to discover which foods your body doesn't like you eating.,
"there are all kinds of alternatives out there in the shops or you can make them yourself, you just have to believe that what you have been led to believe is healthy, is making you so ill!",
it will take time!,
"it will be a shock and it will take a lot of getting use to, there isn't much help out there but this forum is here to assist and help you through it all if you need us!",
you will have to change your mindset on how your future diet is going to be if you do have a form of hypoglycaemia.,

i am not diabetic (that i know of).,
"i'm female in my twenties, i was checked once for diabetes as my ethnicity and strong family history puts me at an increased risk but the test was normal.",
"i'm a trainee healthcare professional, and once after feeling unwell when working within a hospital (on a long shift, nothing to eat) my blood glucose was checked by a colleague and was 2.9mmols.",
i had something sugary and was fine.,
"i usually feel ok but sometimes i wake up feeling very dizzy, light headed, weak etc so i check my blood sugar and it's always under 4mmols.",
"today, i had the day off so woke up, ate a breakfast of mixed fruit (grapes, melon, mango) and didn't feel right, so checked my blood glucose about an hour later, and it was 3.9mmols.",
"i then had coffee with sugar, and a low fat yoghurt and it went to 4.2mmols.",
two hours after that it had dropped to 3.5mmols.,
"i have checked my sugars throughout the day just to experiment and even after sugary drinks, or sweets, my sugars never really go much over 5mmols.",
"i'm usually between 3 to 3.9, or lower if i don't eat for long periods of time.",
is this normal/okay?,
thanks in advance for any replies,
"hello all, have just joined and have a question.",
my mother has a diabetes testing machine at home although neither of my parents are diagnosed as diabetics.,
i think they just wanted to keep a check on blood sugar levels as my grandad had it and they've known other diabetics.,
"recently my mum's been testing me using the strips, and i've twice shown a level around 8.6 mmol 2 hours after a meal.",
"my mum thinks this is high, especially for a 39 year old guy, and particularly as my dad tests at around 5 after the same meal.",
"mum's now recommending i eat very little sugar, keep carbs down and exercise more.",
i'm pretty slim but have had a bit of a sweet tooth over the years.,
can anyone advise on this?,
are these levels anything to really worry about?,
"i am planning to keep sugar down and generally watch what i eat, but would like the odd piece of cake maybe (!).",
your comments much appreciated.,
"by the way, i haven't tested my fasting glucose levels as yet.",
thanks very much.,
thanks all.,
i have been pretty worried by these readings i must admit and am already acting on diet as a result.,
"just to clarify, i've not being diagnosed with anything, probably because i've not been to a doctor about it, yet.",
"also, i don't have any of the symptoms i've read about on this site.",
"i feel fine, and have good energy levels.",
"nomistheman, you said 8.6 is slightly high for a type 2 diabetic - well what is it then for a (i hope) non-diabetic?",
worse i assume?,
"anyway, diet will be changed, more exercise, and i guess i better get that blood test.....one other question on diet - how does honey stack up?",
i've been swirling about a teaspoon in greek yoghurt.,
maybe i shouldn't?,
thanks again.,
thanks all.,
it seems my reading certainly puts me in the region of a prediabetes sufferer.,
its a wake-up call and i've already started cutting down carb portions and cutting out sugary treats and replacing with a bit of cheese or some nuts.,
am i right in saying that not everything sweet is automatically bad though - apples for example?,
"i do quite an active job so don't think i'll go down the no carb route - i hear its dangerous anyway, but carb reduction definitely.",
"would people say that carb control is more important in the long term than say sugar reduction - ie, can you have the odd few sweets or pieces of cake if you are controlling carbs overall?",
"i know, my sweet tooth speaking again....",
"i think what i'm going to do is forego the doctor for the minute, improve lifestyle accordingly and retest on the strips in a month's time to see if things improve.",
maybe then give another month and if readings are still high see a doctor.,
i really don't want to have to go on medication.,
thanks guys for your help - certainly is a shock though.,
thanks for that smiley84 - it has reassured me a bit.,
i know the two tests over 8 have probably led me to panic slightly.,
genetics does play a part i know.,
i think i need to test my fasting levels when i visit my parents next and see what that comes out as.,
"the carb reduction won't do me any harm to be honest - i'm pretty slim as i say but could do with losing a bit off my stomach area, and maybe half a stone in total.",
"i also did binge a bit sometimes on sweet things - biscuits, sweets, and definitely am a big crisp lover, so will moderate these more.",
i expect i need to just watch my diet a bit more than i have been.,
will do a few more readings over time and see what they give.,
"thanks again smiley ok glaves, will do, but thought the standard test was 2 hours after a meal?",
that's what i keep reading on here.,
also will test fasting level too.,
i have to wait until i go to mum's - usually on sundays.,

"he asked me if my blood sugar was stable and i said no, it goes up and down, higher than 7 when i test it at home.",

(the change is only slight).,
is the optometrist just not very experienced with diabetes and vision?,

wonder if anyone knows how long metformin stays in body after finishing taking it?,

ive been doing this for three months and lost almost 2 stone.,
blood tests on meterwent down to 5 on average over first two months and have now been off metformin for four weeks.,
havent changed my way of eating but bloods now closer to 6 in last week could this be because metformin was in my system for several weeks and no longer there?,
im due an hba1c in three weeks will be interesting to see what it says!,

it is more for stopping to much glucose being made and released by the liver.,

i was taking metformin 500mg twice a day and glyburide 5mg twice a day when i was first diagnosed with type 2 about 5 weeks ago.,
i dropped the glyburide to once a day when i dropped below 8.3 (after about a week).,
after a bout 2 weeks my bs dropped from 11.1 to under 5.5 regularly and often under 3.8.,
my doctor dropped me down to 500mg once a day and completely off of the glyburide.,
since i dropped down my dosage my bs has been increasing to now i am back up to 7.7 to 8.3 now.,
a couple days ago i increased my metformin to 1000mg twice a day and i am not noticing any different in my bs.,
how long does it take for metformin to kick in?,
i have doubled my dosage to 1000mg twice a day and there is no difference in my bs.,
i am wondering if the metformin/glyburide combination made that much difference?,
should i get back on glyburide?,
or does it take time for the metformin to take it's full effect.,
can i get your input on this please.,
brunneria said: i think it can take 2-3 weeks for metformin to reach its full effect.,
did you make any dietary changes that may have helped your blood glucose to show such an excellent reduction?,
and is there any chance that you may have reintroduced a few sneaky carbs (also know as carb creep) which may have helped it to rise again?,
"if neither of those apply, then it may well be down to the meds or the med combo.",
click to expand...,
"i changed everything about what i eat, when i eat, and how much i eat.",
i have really cut back on carbs and has made a big difference.,
"i have tried to eat the same, but think i may have cut back to much.",
my bs was dropping so low that i was getting the shakes and feeling week.,
that's why the doctor dropped my dosages.,
"i am just surprised that my bs has not changed since i went from 500mg once a day to 1000mg twice a day, but it has only been a couple days now.",
"kokhongw said: it is not unusual to experience that as our body needs time to readjust to lower, normal glucose levels and up-regulate its ability to use fats as fuel.",
"that is where extra dietary fats, mct oil, virgin coconut oil may be helpful... click to expand...",
i know my doctor said that when i got my bs down below 9.4 this would start happening and it did.,
"hi all, first post on this site, but i have read the forums many many times and always find the input to be useful.",
"i've also searched the forum, but not really found a post that matches my circumstances.",
"a bit about me: i am a type 1 diabetic, have been for 19 years now, i am 23 years old.",
"i like to think i am very knowledgeable about my condition, i look after myself and am pretty well controlled.",
"my last hba1c was 7.0 (not perfect, but not awful).",
"recently i have been noticing that my urine in the morning is rather 'bubbly', as if there was toilet cleaner or alike in the bowl.",
"it's not what i would call 'severe', but is noticeable.",
"i would like to note that this only happens when i wake in the morning, it does not happen at any other time during the day.",
"i, as a lot of other diabetics, get dehydrated in the night, so my urine is very concentrated when i wake up.",
"my last urine / blood tests were done in november, and all was completely normal.",
i also have never had any problems with kidneys in the past.,
"i have an appointment with my doctor in a couple of weeks, as i thought it was best to get it checked out.",
"but for now, i was wondering if anyone else has experienced this?",
it maybe completely normal and i've simply never noticed it before.,
"again, please note that this is exclusively first thing in the morning , and it stops as soon as i've had my first drink.",

"hi all, i have type 1 diabetes, but a friend of mine keeps claiming she has severe hypo's (her words, not mine!).",
"sorry to sound not very nice, but it is getting a bit on my nerves?",
"she doesn't have diabetes, but yesterday we had a days outing with the children and she needed to sit down, told me she was shaking and sweaty and said she couldn't think properly.",
she got some sweets out and told me it happens a lot?,
"i asked if she had seen the doctor, but she said she knew it was a hypo and that all she needed to do was have sugar?",
"she knows i have type 1, and i asked her what she think might happen if she didn't get any sugar and she said she would pass out.",
i asked her if this had happened before and she said 'no'.,
i wanted to ask if anyone knows more about this?,
"i have heard about people with low blood sugars, but i've heard they can't eat sugar because their pancreas over compensates, so they have to be careful????",
"i don't know if this is true, but it's what i've heard.",
"i suppose it irritates me because i know how serious a hypo can be and if my sugar drops, i know it can make me feel tired for at least an hour plus afterwards... depending on how low it was?",
my friend seemed absolutely fine... and i didn't appreciate her dismissing my interest when i questioned her about it?,
"she has also in the past told me i shouldn't have any problems with my diabetes because i have a pump, it's like a cure????",
":yawn: so, basically, i've clearly forgotten what it feels like to have a hypo!!!!",
"sorry to moan, but i wouldn't wish bad hypo's on anyone!!!!",
so please don't make them up!,
thanks xxx thanks for your comments.,
i know i sound like an awful friend by moaning!,
but i think you could be right with the 'pre diabetes'.,
"i suppose i got frustrated because all the children wanted to do was go off and play, but we had to sit down all the time so she could eat.",
she is a large person and i wondered if she was making excuses because she was tired.,
i was also amazed how much she managed to eat yesterday.... and still claimed her blood sugar was low and she needed sugar?,
"my husband also says he feels low sometimes, but it's usually when he hasn't eaten anything for a while.",
i can understand that and support him by making sure he has something..... but then he is very supportive of my hypo's and never tries to compare in any way!,
thanks again :wave: thanks again for your comments!,
"i'll give her the website you've found phoenix, thank you!",
cheers xxx,
"hi everybody i don't know whether anybody can help me with this question, but i hope so.",
"i have been type 1 since 1986, and since diagnosis i have had many hypos's.",
5 years ago i was diagnosed with pernicious anaemia after being referred to a stroke clinic at hospital who found i had low b12 and folate levels.,
"i was age 41, and had real signs of dementia, absolute confusion and forgetfulness.",
i then went on to having 13 weekly b12 injections.,
"6 weeks ago my new gp undiagnosed the pernicious anaemia as 5 years ago i was not given an intrinsic factor test, and one he did for me came back negative.",
"my b12 injections have now been stopped, and all signs of demntia are coming back.......well, today the gp said that he had been reading up on diabetes, hypos and longterm brain damage......and he believes i have damaged my brain from previously having many hypo's.....when i asked him what he classified as hypo, he said that it was basically any level for a type 1 diabetic that measured under 5.0 when testing bg.",
he said that he thinks my confusion and forgetfulness may be down to having hypos......has anybody ever heard of this??,
"he also suggested that although my sever hypo's have had a marked improvement for a few years, that the damage may result years later from having bad hypo's.",
"he has ignored the fact that after my b12 injections started my brain acted a lot better, and he has also ignored the fact that b12 injections can help with diabetic neuropathy, which i also have symptoms of.",
has anybody ever had it suggested to them that hypo's can cause longterm brain damage?,
"thanks for the comments everyone, to be quite honest, i don't really care what level the gp thinks is classified as hypo.",
i think he was balancing it with normal persons and saying that under 5 can cause brain to have less functionality.,
"my only concern is that my gp thinks my previous hypo's have caused me long term brain damage, and this is reflecting years and years later.",
i was always made aware of long term damage from raised bloods but i have never been made aware of hypo's causing me long term brain damage.,
this statement is totally new to me and i would have screamed at the top of my voice to get help with the hypo's a lot quicker had i known i was going to cause myself brain damage further down my life.,
"i still think it is b12 related but until my levels drop to 'below normal' the gp will not allow anymore b12, despite a lot of people with perncious anaemia saying they don't function at 'normal levels' (i didn't think i di) he is going to make me go 'demented' until they fall.",
"the intrinsic factor test for pernicious anaemia has only got a 30% accuracy rate, and is not gold standard compared to the tests for diabetes.",
"so the fact that my test came back negative, it has a chance of being 70% inaccurate.",
i can see that i will be researching this on the net for the next few weeks till i see him again.,
hi jus thank you for your response.,
"i am actually undergoing tests and referrals and discussions with gp have gone along the lines of a possibility of fibromyalgia.......i am only 46 and have been on synthetic the whold of my 20+ years, and nobody will alter the insulin to human because as the gp's have all said as with my simvastatin - 'i have been on them too long to moan about side effects'.",
i have wondered whether i get the bad side effects due to the simvastatins.,
"i have been moaning about pain for past 15 years, and it is only just this gp that has done an ana test that has come up positive.",
even 5 years ago when my rheumatoid factor was over 300-i wasn't informed (and normal level is 14).,
"i have now got a gp that is referring me to neurologist and rheumatologist now for my confusion, forgetfulness, legs, spine ...basically my brain and pains.",
"gp i have now is fantastic, but i just didn't have any understanding that hypo's scar your brain and can cause long term damage.",
"i think i have a fair way to go for confirmed diagnosis of my problems, but gp did say he wasn't a specialist and would leave it to the people that are, so, but did state about the hypo's too.",
"thanks though, it is another thing to question the neurologist...... shax thanks for response hana ref t1 husband...very encouraging.",
i really think i know what is causing me problems.....simvastatin 40mg.,
"gp won't let me come off it, but weighing up the problems with my brain and muscles and the side effects of simvastatin, this i think is the major problem.",
"gp won't listen to me, i have asked a number of times about the statin.",
"my high speckled ana can come from drug induced lupus, which comes from simvastatin 'poisoning'.",
simvapoison can also give anaemia too....this was diagnosed originally 2 years after statins were given to me.,
"it can take up to 20 years to lose b12 from your liver, but i am now convinced that simvapoison lowered my b12.",
"i am going to a rheumatologist and neurologist, and am hoping that they may help me ref the simvastatin.",
"i have stopped taking simvapoison, as my cholesterol wasn't high when i was put on 20mg, it was just another recommendation for diabetics, which then got upped to 40mg, again as it was found 40mg was 'just as good as 20mg'.",
"i know that reversal of simvapoisoning can take an age, but i have read that i should be taking far higher coq10 qtys than i was taking.",
"i have also read that higher vit c intake can help reduce cholesterol, and if it is simvapoison lowering my b12 then that too should start to come good.",
i really just want my life back.,
is a blood sugar over 30 dangerous in itself?,
"in other words, should you only seek medical attention if ketone levels are high or does the blood sugar itself require some intervention?",
my blood sugar is currently 31.2 but i have no way of testing for ketones as the ketostix the doctor gave me (after much persuasion by me!),
are out of date and my blood monitor doesn't test for them.,
"i've had a minor surgical procedure in the last 2 weeks which is supposed to take 4-6 weeks to heal, possibly more and i'm also in the middle of lowering my lantus dose and adjusting my humalog ratios for carb counting, so that might be affecting things.",
my sugars often run a bit high anyway (around 12 but not usually higher) but they've been steadily rising over the last few days.,
(i know because i'm currently doing my hospital's version of the dafne course so i'm monitoring my levels and insulin timings and doses really closely.,
they were sort of 17-20 but now they've shot up to 30.,
i'm due at the diabetes clinic on monday morning for the next session of the course with the dsn.,
"they have meters there to test for ketones, so i'll be able to check then.",
i'm just wondering if a blood sugar of over 30 on its own is dangerous.,
i doubt ketones would have built up enough in this last couple of days to worry about that too much - or maybe i'm wrong.,
"i don't know how quickly they develop..... aaargh, i can barely think straight right now and i feel horrendous.",
any thoughts or advice are welcome.... thank you!,
"oh and in case my sig doesn't show for some reason, i've been type1 for 21 years, on lantus and humalog, plus metformin & victoza.",
"my background lantus insulin has been too high and has been making me drop too low in my sleep, meaning i have a hypo and am not waking up and my blood sugar levels are constantly rebounding backwards and forwards.",
we're trying to get the lantus level right so that my bed-time reading and waking readings are the same +/- 2mmol and that's meant having to reduce it.,
then i have to work out the correct ratio for carbs bolus with the humalog.,
i hope that made sense.,
"i've only been over 20 in the last 2 days, and then 30+ this evening.",
"i'm staying at my mum's rather than on my own at my flat, and i'm not planning on going anywhere, so i'm safe enough.",
"i've taken the first of the correction doses of humalog that i've been advised to do, so now i'm waiting 4 hours to retest my levels and take another correction dose then.",
"actually i do need to get my lantus level correct first and that level needs lowering, for the reasons i stated above.",
"once that's correct, then i can increase my fast-acting insulin to carbs ratio and hopefully get my overall blood sugar levels down.",
"unless the lantus is right first, nothing else is going to be right.",
"ihs said: picklebean, how do you know that youve been going low bg overnight.",
have you been getting up and testing or had a cgm going?,
"sent from the diabetes forum app click to expand... because the dsn and i have been monitoring my sugar levels over the last few months and the pattern has been that without any carbs or fast-acting insulin in my system, so only lantus being present, then my blood sugars are dropping far too low when they should be staying steady, including having hypos in the night which i have woken up to and treated.",
i haven't purposefully woken myself up to take middle-of-the-night readings to see if i'm going too low.,
"but i'll go to bed at a level of, say, 10 and will wake up at 4.",
or i'll actually wake to a hypo.,
"it's not supposed to drop that much, with only lantus in my system it should be staying fairly level.",
"up until the last few days it was working fine, i was no longer getting any super high readings and no longer having lots of hypos, i've been much steadier and with readings of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.... nothing like this high of 31.2 thanks all for your replies so far!",
sorry if i'm not explaining myself very well.,
i have taken 3u of humalog extra.,
that's working on the assumption that 1u will decrease blood sugar by 2-3 mmol/l.,
i've been told by the dsn not to give more than 3u in one go if it's a 'correction dose' taken to correct a high blood sugar (i still don't fully understand the reasoning on that one!),
then i'll test in 4 hours (the length of time the humalog will be working for) and see what my reading is and can then take another 3u correction dose.,
so it has to be done slowly rather than all in one go to prevent an overdose.,
right now i'd gladly go swimming in the damn stuff if it makes me feel better.,
"thank you smidge, that sounds like very sensible information.",
i think i've had all these dafne rules drummed into me in the last week and we haven't covered sick-days yet.,
"so i wasn't trying to reject everyone's suggestion of taking more fast-acting insulin, and i have already taken some extra, i was just trying to stick to the rules i've been taught recently.",
but i guess a blood sugar reading of over 30 is kind of a different situation that needs immediate action.,
thanks everyone.,
"i'll keep on testing and jabbing oh no, you didn't sound terse at all smidge, don't worry!",
i was simply trying to explain why i seemed so determined to only take 3u every 4hours.,
"the extra info you've given, or maybe it was just the way you put it, made it clear to me that i need to take more than that at this point.",
so thank you.,
and thanks every else too!,
much appreciated!,
"update: 2 and 1/2 hours after the 31.2 reading i'm down to 20.1 now, so definitely heading in the right direction!",
i've read that many people reuse their lancets and although it seems to me to be a bad idea my lancets didn't turn up last week so i cleaned off my needle today with tcp and used it twice as i only have 1 left.,
how many people here reuse their lancets out of interest?,
"and i also poke the needle into the lid of the next lancet so no-one can catch themselves on it if they put their hands into the bin, but should i be throwing it away in my general household waste or should i be using a more safe way of disposing?",
i've not had my 1st meeting yet with my diabetic nurse so thought i'd ask you guys instead.,
"energize said: hi definitley not throw lancets in the general bin, even if re-covered with the plastic tip - it could come off with movement etc.",
"i now have a yellow sharps bin because of being prescribed test strips but, prior to this, i used the empty container the test strips came in (or empty tablet bottle etc) and just taped it up when full and put in the bin or would take to the pharmacy and ask them if they could dispose of them for me.",
hope this helps julie click to expand...,
thanks julie - that's far more sensible - i'll do that when you all reuse the lancets do you clean them off at all?,
"andbreathe said: i don't change lancets every time, but when i do, i push the sharp all the way into the twist off portion of the new lancet.",
"i perceive the risk to be minimal, if we think about the other stuff routinely going into waste.",
"i mean, does anyone have a sharps bin for disposable razors ?",
"whilst for the few cans we use, we always ensure the can top goes into the can, before disposal, but there's still a raggedy edge.",
"there is a far more significant risk of a blood letting experience if one ""encountered"" one of those in a bin that the short, extremely fine lancet.",
"we i using injectables, i'd put all my sharps in the yellow bin, but otherwise i don't think i'm significantly increasing any health risk to anyone.",
click to expand... @andbreathe - yes that's what i was doing.,
good point you make and very true as well.,
but i do like the earlier suggestion of putting it in the bottle for the testing strips - and then if i had a project where i needed to cut paper (ideal for art projects cutting around paper - i tried it the other day and was amazed how sharp they really are!!),
then at least i'd still have them available i am not entirely convinced that they shouldn't have a quick clean off first ... there has got to be bacteria growing afterwards?!,
still...it's not hurt either of you so far - so i can breathe a little easier knowing i've used it twice after applying tcp.,
thanks everyone - that really helps.,
lol :-d hahaha good point bulkbiker...i was worrying about that too.,
can i ask you another question aside from this one please?,
you mention no more meds after 3 weeks of metformin hell...and when i see the nurse they are talking about putting me on this stuff as well as statins.,
i'm going to insist on a 'no' for the statins...but what issues did you have with metformin?,
appointment next week with dn and it will be the usual tale of your bs is too high as is my weight.,
i have constantly struggled with my weight and the use of metformin which creates untold problems with my insides.,
"question is ,is there a better medication which creates fewer issues than metformin?",
some seem to create other difficulties and also weight gain.,
i wou;d be excited to lose weight but i cannot seem to get to grips with the low carb diet!,
so the usual once a year angst!,
any suggestions?,
"voodoorising said: hi debpre, there is a slow release version of metformin that might be easier on your stomach and other issues allot ask for it if it's causing an issue.",
i was offered it if i had problems but fortunately i seem to be ok on the regular metformin.,
as for weight lose i can't help as i think it's personal fight i don't know what you eat or what your diet is but for me lchf works i lost 3 stone and feel much healthier and my bs is relatively low.,
"i am sure some one with greater wisdom will tell you more, i am only 11 months i click to expand...",
i am on slow release already and have tried suggestions on this forum on various ways to take it but still upsets my stomach!,
"i'm a type 1 insulin dependent diabetic man of 57 years of aged, diagnosed about 25 years ago, straight onto insulin + tables.",

"i was prescribed statins based on age and bmi, despite never having had high cholesterol (i have always believed that this was related to cooking food from scratch and avoiding processed food).",
"anyway, i had all the side effects, muscle pain, poor sleep, poor concentration, mild nausea etc.",
"anecdotally, i have some evidence that statin use in people with low/lowish cholesterol is linked to an increased likelihood of adverse side effects.",
just wondered what others experience of this was?,
"noblehead said: you should mention the side-effects to your dr @midnightrider you can also report side-effects from drugs using the mhra yellow card scheme: https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/ click to expand... have done, they were not interested.",
"gp said that they are prescribed based on bmi, not test results!",
daibell said: hi.,
"yes, many, many threads.",
in my opinion no one should take statins without a fasting lipids blood test to check levels without statins as you may not need them.,
the guidelines to offer diabetics statins based on a non-evidence based formula i can't support.,
i'm on statins to help with a minor cardiac problem and poor lipids results and i have no side effects but i only have enough to bring me into the right range.,
many suffer bad effects including muscle breakdown and hence the statins should be stopped.,
my wife suffered serious liver pain within a few days and had to stop.,
i would insist on a lipids (cholesterol) test which the gps should do anyway once you are on statins and discuss with the gp why you are on them without a test.,
click to expand...,
"i had a test, it showed low cholesterol levels.",
statins prescribed anyway.,
"you haven't experienced side effects but with high lipids i wouldn't expect you to, it is my theory that side effects are more pronounced in those taking statins with lower cholesterol (ie, who don't need them)",
"i was only diagnosed on monday, but today i got a call from the surgery to say i have a vit d deficiency.",

"while on one hand i am happy that my doctor has obviously been re-checking my results, i am also curious as vit d deficiency seems to be quite widespread in the t2 community.",
"i have read up a little but can't find out a great deal, is there a reason why t2 diabetics do seem to be vit d deficient?",
"i should add, i have been taking a multi vit which includes 100% rda of vit d for a long time.",
carty said: hi defren i had a vit d test which came back yesterday the gp said i had the highest levels he had seen but i was only .1 above the minimum level so obviously a low level in general i am type 2 by the way and i dont take vit d supplements but i do take cod liver oil capsules which the gp thought may be the reason i had good levels along with a good diet carol click to expand... cod liver oil?,
i used to take a daily capsule of that.,
i may try that again.,
i don't mind taking supplements as i take a daily multi vit.,
it was only through reading things via google i saw many t2 diabetics do have this.,
"i wondered what, if any the connections was, but your high level has blown that theory out the window.",

"mac, i suffer from the most terrible fatigue.",
"it's nothing like ordinary tiredness, i will be sitting and all of a sudden am fighting to stay awake.",
"when i go to bed at night, i can easily sleep 13+ hours and still be exhausted.",

if these high sugars damage your eyes would you be hapoy to live permanently that way?,
myself i was craving sugary foods too.,
the only solution is medical intervention and reduced carbs.,

if your hungry nibble on salad finger foods and have a pan of cooked veg at the ready.,
give it a go.,
good luck.,
give yourself a chance to get those dangerous numbers down.,

"i've got good memories of that pen - it always gave me a bit of confidence about accuracy and reliability, which i never got with solostar.",
"might still have my old pen at home somewhere - will have to search tonight, but will email my doctor now to get a new one ordered anyway.",

"i am 4 months post diagnosis day (t2); i have drastically cut my carbs and have shed 15 kg of weight down to 92kg from 107 (height is 5' 11"" - big build).",
"a month ago i experienced quite severe stomach cramps and hot and cold ""flushes"" (i am a man :wink: ).",
"these cramps went aways after about an hour and then, some weeks later reappeared; only to ease again for another few weeks.",
"so here's the thing; gillian mckeith's tv series in 2004 or so (you are what you eat), contains some interesting information about drastic carb reductions.",
she states that we cannot cut the carbs entirely and symptoms resulting from this include ... stomach cramps.,
"the difficulty i have is that i am very intolerant to most carbs including potato, bread, pasta etc; so i have a small amount of porridge in the morning and this wil generally be the majority of my carb intake for the day.",
question : do these stomach cramps align with your experiences?,
what is their cause and what is the best way forward?,
(yes i will ask my diabetes nurse but i seek the experiences from this forum too).,
"many thanks on this fathers' day (with the rumblings of stomach cramps in the background, hence this post !!)",
"john well; judging by the lack of response, i must assume that either the cramps are not associated with the low carbs or none of you have experience of this.",
i have to say it's not regular but bow; when it occurs you know about it.,
thanks john thanks mo; no i am not taking any meds.,
my wife chrissie is not diabetic but she has cut the carbs in a similar way (as we share meals) and she too has suffered these occasional stomach cramps.,
i'll look up the atkins diet.,
thanks again.,
hi.,
well yes.,
but not as much because since losing lots of weight my bg had improved and my ability to process carbs had also improved.,
so i eating more carbs than a few months ago and the cramps have faded too.,
the same with my non diabetic partner mirrors my diet.,
so we are pretty convinced that ultra low carbs causes stomach cramps.,
thanks for your post.,
john sent from the diabetes forum app,
hi everyone...first forum i have ever used :shock: so i dont really know what im doing but i will give it a try :lol: pretty easy question and i just need a pretty easy answer.,
every time i have searched this different answers have come up... yes.. no... maybe... definitely not -.-' does anyone know for sure whether a type 1 diabetic can become a paramedic because im 17 and looking to become a paramedic after i finish college in september next year.,
im perfectly fit hit gym 3 times a week and yeah controls is pretty good.,
thanks hi cugila thanks for the reply.,
so really i can train to become a paramedic?,
however i wont be about to drive the vehicle?,
does that apply for the paramedic cars?,
if i have the right end of the stick :lol: thanks for the link aswell which i will check out now.,
quite a big kick in the nuts but thanks for the truth you have been a big help thanks for both replying jopar and alan.,
the sugguestion for the nursing career and then specialise in the a&e department is a great idea and i will look into it.,
"as for specialising in a more diabetic path as suggested in your post alan i can't really seeing myself telling other diabetics what there doing wrong and what they have to do knowing full well that sometimes you can give your all to get, say trying to achieve low results but not being able to achieve them, and im looking into a wider view of helping a wider range of people rather than a certain condition thank you very much that means a lot to me.",
"copepod, wow.",
what a great list of events and successes you have had!,
"great to see that just because you have diabetics its not stopped you in life, which is what i want, because there are some people that think there life is over because they have it and the activities that you have organized show that it shouldn't effect us at all.",
thanks for the post.,
thank you both for you input in this thread i have a few more months before i decide what to do but i sure wont get diabetic hold me back!,
":lol: hey annabeth, i read your post yesterday and my jaw dropped :lol: but i got carried away with some other stuff and didnt get time to reply.",

can anyone help?,

"was prescribed glipizide (2.5mg before lunch and 5mg before evening meal) 2 years ago which worked fine, but then recurrent hypos in december made me beg for different meds.",
"i was put on gliclazide (basically because the pills are bigger therefore easier to cut in half and have one before breakfast, thereby avoiding afternoon hypo -- taking 20mg before breakfast and 40mg before dinner.)",
"no hypos (hooray) and fasting readings basically ok, but my hba1c has shot up from 6.1 to 7.2, and the spikes after meals are just wild (2 hours after meals always at least 9, sometimes up to 12.5).",
"my testing seems to suggest that gliclazide can bring my levels down very effectively in longer term (a mere 20mg before breakfast and at 6pm i'm 5.4), but it is very slow acting, and that is presumably affecting my hba1c.",
the spikes are obviously a real concern.,
has anyone else experienced this with gliclazide?,
"glip and glic always tend to be simply grouped together, but do they act in different ways?",
and what's the point of being slow acting?,
"by the way, it would be good some time to run a thread on 'how many types of diabetes?'",

one big diabetes professor told me that in the future we will be seen as having lived in a very primitive age when people assumed you were either t1 or t2 -- he forecast we will soon be talking about hundreds of types of diabetes.,
"cf: 'diabetes is not a single disease but a syndrome with at least fifty possible causes' (r. tattersall, diabetes.",
the biography).,
thanks daibell.,
i'll try an hour before or even longer - see what happens.,
it will take a long time for clinics to ditch the t1/t2 mentality.,
"i went to a diabetes awareness day where we all heard said professor tell us that there were huge numbers of diabetes types and that it was primitive to think in terms of just t1 and t2, and then immediately afterwards we were told to divide up into separate groups, t1 or t2.",
"there were a gratifying number of us who didn't fit -- not just lada, 1.5 etc.",
i think i'm officially 'god knows'.,
"hi there, this may be a daft question but bear with me - first post!",
i was diagnosed two weeks ago and on diet only.,
was given advice from the hospital to up my intake of carbohydrate.,
i'm pretty much vegan (amusingly for health reasons!),
"and eat a lot of grains, root vegetables etc anyway.",
"after a search on the internet for ways to change my diet, i came across david mendosa's website and read about channa dal.",
"i've had it for dinner three nights in a row now, basically a dal curry with tomatoes and different greens and, tonight, i added a small serving of quinoa.",
"i've tested before the channa dal meals, at one hour after eating and then two hours after eating.",
my blood glucose appears to have barely moved.,
"last night it was 5.1 before eating, 5.9 one hour after and 5.6 two hours after.",
my question is this - does channa dal have some kind of delayed effect i.e.,
does it takes hours to digest and could it be causing spikes hours later?,
i test before going to bed and for the last 10 days the reading has been between 4.9 - 6.5.,
first morning reading is between 4.9 - 6.9.,
could the channa dal be playing havoc during the wee small hours?,
thanks in advance for any replies!,
thanks phoenix - that's really helpful.,
it's great having a forum to ask these questions - seems like every day is an experiment with what to eat at the moment.,
thanks spiral.,
"the channa dal is working out well for me, when you look at the carb content it's higher than chick peas etc.",
you must be right - indigestible carbs!,
"curiously, it seems to lower the effect of other foods eaten at the same time or shortly after.",
on holiday next week so will give the middle of the night test a go and report back.,
i haven't experimented with avocado yet.,
"hi hana, there's a whole section on chana dal on the mendosa site - they're under articles-food-channa dal.",
"http://mendosa.com/chanadal.html i did some internet searches to find out if dr bernstein had tried out chana dal, couldn't find anything but i don't have a copy of his book - yet!",
i've been impressed with the chana dal results but going to try testing in the middle of the night.,
i'm a natural sceptic!,
"the obvious carbs i eat are bergen bread (2 slices max every other day) and i currently have cereal for breakfast (10g special k, 10g all bran & almonds with soya milk).",
"i eat green veg and salad leaves, quorn, small amounts of pulses, nuts, berries and very small amounts of other fruits (pear, apple, tomato).",
"i also eat quiona, barley, bulger wheat and yoghurt and cocoa nib raw chocolate.",
i've found most things are ok for me blood sugar wise in small portions.,
i eat out a lot and obviously few restaurants cater to this kind of diet!,
"i tend to order just a starter and side dish, no-one seems to mind.",
not too sure how to count carbs so don't know how many i eat per day - i would estimate that a medium carber!,
the expection is the breakfast cereal.,
i'm keen to find a low carb replacement for cereal at breakfast but laziness currently preventing this.,
i eat my cereal then walk to work and my blood sugar is ok - between 6 and 7.,
if i don't walk the mile up-hill to work it spikes up to 8 - 9 i've had two a1c results - the first on diagnosis 10% and the second three weeks later 6.7% (see my post querying this result!),
happy to post finger prick test results and diet info if anyone would find it interesting.,
"hi guys, as promised, i got up in the middle of the night to check out whether the channa dal had a really long processing time.",
i had a fairly good portion of channa dal cooked with spices and tinned tomatoes and a cup of broccoli.,
bg readings were: pre-meal (7.20pm) 4.8 1 hour post meal 5.0 2 hours post meal 5.2 before bed (11pm) 5.3 night (2.30am) 5.0 before breakfast (fasting) glucose at 9.30am today (well i am on holiday :lol: ) was 5.3.,
looks like the channa dal works well for me.,
"as a comparison, a burgen bread sandwhich (2 slices) with houmous and salad sends my 1 hour post meal up to between 7 and 8!",
although it does drop back again to pre meal level after another hour.,
i'm on diet only at the mo (though told progression to insulin is a certaintity) so pleased i can at least eat channa without testing.,
hope this helps x,
since june ive been under the hospital for my diabetes.,
"my sugars arent lowering, so was put on a slow release insulin.",
all appointments have been with the dn.,
"in two weeks time, i have my first appointment with the consultant.",
what will this appointment be like????,
will he/she make the decisions of whether i need to go on a fast acting insulin with my meals?,
my dn implied that would be quite likely.,
"for some reason, im absolutely dreading the appointment.",
"therefore, any help & advice would be greatly appreciated x daibell said: hi.",
if you are quite slim it's possible the consultant will query whether you are actually t1 and not t2 and can do tests if he thinks that's possible.,
he may well add a mealtime insulin (bolus) if your hba1c is still not good enough.,
if a bolus is added do ask about carb-counting for mealtime carbs.,
for some reason the nhs thinks this is very complex and may send you on a 1 week course.,
my dn explained it to me in 15 minutes when she added the bolus.,
"click to expand... ive bought a book for carb counting, from amazon.",
"its brilliant, its shows the amount of carbs,sugars etc.",
i wouldnt have thought that carb counting is that difficult.,
do you carb count???,

i hv heard raw mango is rich in vitamin c plz let me know can diabtic eat raw mango?thnx for yr guidence,
i was diagnosed a month ago with type 2 and told by gp to try dieting for three months before they will do anything - other than a check with the diabetic nurse (due 30th of this month).,
"i have been feeling really unwell - sweating profusely, tired to the point of feeling comatosed, lack of sleep through going to the loo 3/4 times a night.",
having bought myself a monitor i find that my readings are constantly between 13 - 17.,
i am not on any diabetic medication.,
i feel it is not good that gp seems to think just go off for three months and cut down on sweet things and carbs leaving me in this very uncomfortable state.,
stephen & clare - many thanks for your replies and opinions.,
i saw gp this afternoon for the results of the h whatever blood test and she said my bs has been very high for at least the last 90 days and has prescribed metformin onee of which i have just taken.,
"it makes me cross to think that i have been complaining of extreme tiredness, excess sweating and running to the loo for months now and not one of my gps thought to investigate diabetes as a possible cause, in which case i could have been feeling better by now.",
thanks for your views.,
:?,
looking at posts on the forum i see people stating their bg levels of 7 -8 are considered very high and they are wondering what they should do about it.,
mine are constantly between 12 - 16 and yet when i saw gp on monday she didn't seem that bothered at those readings.,
has started me on metformin 1 x 500 a day and up to now not much sign of any reduction in my levels - last reading was 14.7.,
"would like to know what exactly is the ""norm"" reading and if 7 is considered high then why is my gp not concerned at my readings?",
"i have had t2 diagnosed since december 2008 and i managed to take my medication, exercise and diet seriously and brought all back to normal readings.",
i was on 7.9 when diagnosed and have lost 11 kgs even since.,
i am still to lose another 5 kgs and it should be bang on with the doc's target goal for me.,
"i am on metformin 500mg x2, atorvastatin, 20mg aspirin but lately i have been experiencing light headedness each time i eat.",
i keep to low carbs and low fat - would i be doing something wrong ?,
or it it that my body is not adjusting anymore.,
i am worried.,
i don't want to climb up the insulin ladder so soon and trying my best to halt it.,
please help !!!,
this forum is great and worked wonders for me.,
i was heavily depressed and suicidal and people on this forum really made life with t2 sound pretty 'normal' now.,
thank you all and may you all enjoy some good health.,
thanks for all your advices.,
really appreciated.,
"i am no on daily testing as yet, doctor thinks i don't need it as yet.",
so quite confusing.,
"i have not had any blood pressure trouble so far, however mostly on the low side as i am also taking iron for anaemia.",
i had the same symptoms at the beg.,
of the diagnosis and when i was put on medication.,
"then, the doctor thought i should reduce the dose from 850 to 500 mg of metformin twice a day.",
"when my readings went normal, the dietician thought i should stop the medication but doc asked me to continue to stay on the safe side.",
"i am really scared to drift into depression if any of the readings are not good, as it is not easy to find edible things to keep off the hunger pangs in vietnam and being mostly vegetarian.",
i am on holiday in lanzarote.,
i was just told to go to the toilet(just outside of the restaurant/very close to it) to take my blood and insulin if i wanted to eat food.,
i got very upset and did that.,
is this discrimination?,
am i covered by eu laws that i could take my blood / insulin where i want?,
thank you for the support peoples !!!,
it means a lot !,
!,
wondering if the equality act prevents stuff like that but all the stuff i could find was work related really - it's useful if i was @ work - but on holiday atm thanks for the comments,
i previously reduced my hba1c from 49 to 39.,
"i'm continuing exactly the same way i was before but my bg has been rising, culminating in a reading just now of 10.7.",
i just don't understand.,
they were in the 4.6 to 4.9 reason at night previously.,
seriously feel like giving up this seemingly worthless fight now.,
i've dropped 3 stones and it seems it's done nothing at all to help.,
so down right now and i don't even feel like apologising for even that!!!!,
sent from the diabetes forum app i should also have said that i take no medication and my bmi is perfect now.,
i don't understand and i don't know where to turn next sent from the diabetes forum app i'm eating exactly as i was eating when i reduced from hba1c of 49 to 39.,
i'm genuinely bewildered.,
sent from the diabetes forum app thank you scandichic and nosher835.,
it's really cool weather here now and when it was hot my readings were fine.,
this setback has really got to me because i stick to the same old boring diet all the time and now even that's failing me.,
i'm at a loss.,
"sent from the diabetes forum app have you got any infection, bugs, had recent vaccinations?",
no.,
nothing at all.,
i'm very tired all the time but that's about it.,
extraordinarily tired.,
"sent from the diabetes forum app no, i'm not confusing them.",
i just couldn't understand why it was so high when my average is 5.7.,
right from the beginning i've never had a result that high.,
i've had a good sleep but still tired this morning and my waking reading was 5.9.,
it scared me last night because i'd only had an omelette with a bit of cheddar cheese for dinner.,
sent from the diabetes forum app mountains and molehills whatever....,
i'm doing my best with this.,
i always wash and thoroughly dry my hands before testing and i only test as advised by my hospital consultant.,
"it just scared me, simple as that, having not had one anything like that level before.",
"no bluetit1802, i didn't re-test even though logic told me to.",
"i simply did a little internal panic, posted the question on here, saw a few replies, replied to them and went to sleep, which is more or less what i've been doing for most of the morning.",
very tired these last few days with no obvious reason.,
"i'll just continue as i was, hopefully making progress.",
thank you.,
"i have just seen an article i believe was published in the mail about the sugar content in a pint of beer ,as indicated in my profile i only ever have one pint on any occasion 2 or possibly 3 times maximum a week.",

i went to hospital to have a fasting blood sugar test.,
i don't have a doctor.,
i want to be tested out of curiosity.,
the result is 7.3 mmol/l and the normal range is 3.8-6.1.,
would a doctor diagnose me as a type 2 diabetic person?,
i am so worried and it is really depressing because my mother had type 2 diabetes and i know all her hardships and that is the cause of her death.,
i'm 25 years old.,
and they say people with this disease will only live for 20 years and below and there is no cure.,
you can just only slow it down.,
"so, it is 2016.",
still no cure for this disease?,
is there something i can do to reverse my condition without medication?,
i want to do something while i am still young to prevent those complications that are caused by diabetes.,

new to this so apologies if i am talking rubbish.,
went to the docs last thurs morning for a blood test and it came back at 15.9 whatever this means as i have no idea !,

getting a bit concerned...my symptoms are: (other than the test) itchy groin area :| tiredness very iritative go to the toilet during the night up to 6 times eyesight goes blurry regularly my first test was an hour after 2 slices of toast with butter and coffee without sugar.,
anyone any ideas ?,
thanks for the positive response...any idea what my ideal fasting test resultsshould be ?,
dave should toast and a sugarless coffee an hour before the test make it go so high ?,
forgot to mention the last few months i have started to sweat incredibly for no reason...hasn't been as bad the last week or so though fasting blood test has come back at 12.8...going for 2nd test tomorrow.,
what does this mean ?,
:| can't say it is but hey not a lot i can do about it !.,
why do i have to do 2 fasting tests ?,
dave people cheat to get treated for something they might not have !,
some weird people around dave second fasting test back at 15.8...will i need to be on medication ?...just so i know what to expect when i go back to the quacks.,
dave diagnosed today as t2...start metformin (is this spelt correctly) on monday as well as some other pills.,

confused to hell about what to eat now !,

i've just been prescribed forxiga.,
first in the unit.,
anyone else on it?,
is there anything you've noticed i should look out for.,

no one?,

the chest pains are a worry but they'll either pass or kill me.,
:roll: sent from the diabetes forum app re: forxiga - anyone else on it?,
sadly the chest pains which may or may not be related have meant i've been advised to come off forxiga.,

hello everybody my name is tony i'm hoping somebody out there can help me.,
i'm type 2 but in january my control was so bad they put me on insulin (just 10 ml a day that i take over night) it worked and my sugars are really good.,
but unfortunately they revoked my pcv licence.,
the criteria for getting it back is three months metre readings taken at least twice a day.,
now i'm afraid i have been negligent a few times and did it only once a day.,
i have not been driving at work since going on insulin so didn't see the importance.,
now i do because they have turned down my re application.,
so to avoid having to start afresh my 3 months (and losing my job) can anyone out there let me know if there's a tolerance of how many misses you can have and be ok. because having completed two more months i forgot my metre last week and mist two days.,
can anyone help please.,
tony.,
britishpub said: it will be your doctor who has advised dvla that you should not have your cat d licence reinstated.,
dvla make these decisions based on your doctors advice.,
"the way the system will work is that the form completed by your doctor is checked, and certain responses will automatically mean the licence is revoked.",
if the tick in the box asking if you have provided 3 months readings is missing the case is referred for further assessment.,
if your doctor ticks no in the next box asking if he/she thinks you should still have a cat d licence it is an automatic refusal.,

dvla dont differentiate between t1 and t2 or what insulin regime you are on.,
"the 2 tests a day is considered the bare minimum, based on the idea that a professional driver will have 2 driving periods a day with a break in between which would require two tests.",
"the dvla medical council has been pressing for this to be increased to 4 or 6 a day, but so far dvla has stuck with 2 times a day.",
the caseworker would need to show a good reason to override the automatic revocation and issue a licence.,

"hello everyone, i was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in july with a hba1c reading of 52, was advised i could maybe reverse my diabetes if i lost some weight.",
"i had my first 3 month diabetic check up and after loosing 4 stone my hba1c reading is now 39 which is a normal non diabetic level but was told i will be a type 2 diabetic for life, very confused??",
?,
hi all as i have just been dx as a t2 abt 3 weeks ago my diabetic nurse dine my hba1c blood test and result came back as 5.2. i know that for all diabetic is great news and for me too.,
"but as i explianed to the nurse that the reading will be false, she said no its accurate, i said the test is done over the last 3 months.",
"so months 1 and 2 the hba1c count fine as bs fine no rise and then into month 3 my bs starts to rise, so i explained that reading will only give an account of the last month when my bs started to rise and not in months 1 and 2 as it was fine then so take the average from months 1 to 3 we have 5.2 but not taking in account the rise in month 3. am i making sense that my hba1c result will be false or is my nurse correct in saying its accurate.",
any info apprecated.,
"thanks eggie hi cugila by reading your post and explaining a normal non person glucose level is below 5.5 as for me mine came back as 5.2 but was dx as being diabetic , i do have some days where i do not take my tabs and reading are at 8.3 after abt 6 hrs food and sometimes at 5.7 but also i have days when my readings are at 4.4 , 5.7 and sometimes 7.1 that could be down to the amount of carbs i'm eating which are cheese pasties cheese sandwiches mincepies .",
"i'm now thinking on the lines i might be wrongly diagnosed as not having high blood sugar maybe have something known as hyperinsulemia, where the body producing too much insulin as as i had 2 episodes of hypo's already after being told that i am diabetic did have these episodes before but didnt what they where know i know.",
just to put my mind at rest i performed in home glucose test 75g of glucose bought from boots powdered form disssolved in 250ml of water.,
fasted for 8 hours reading 5.1 drank solution and took reading at 45 mins 7.9 then at hour and half 6.1 and then at 2 hours 6.4.,
i know the test is not done acurately but it does give an indiction that my body does somehow over produce insulin because with that amount of glucose in my body my blood sugar should have rose considerably high in my opinion.,
so the test done so it give an indiction of hyperinsulemia or is hyperinsulemia totally different or am i just insulin resistant.,
"any opinion welcome thank eggie hi cugila i know cugila its confusing but my hba1c result reflects thats , a result of 5.2 would mean that i am not diabetic ?",
then the gp says i am so i am jut as confused then the test i performed at home my glucose never rose over 7.9 in two hours.,
"a drink containing 75g of glucose my bs should have rose well over 7.9 , but it didnt most it rose in the 45 min peak was 6.1or so may be say 6.7 or 6.8 in the hour and then back to 6.1.",
so evrything is a bit confusing evidence suggests i am not diabetic gp says i am si confused.,
as you suggest will ask gp to refer me for more tests and when i find out will post results here but mind you wont be for a while terrible around here for appointments can wait for months on end.,
so keep you posted when i hear more.,
"thanks for all your advice given so far eggie hi cugila at present there is alot of confusion flying around especially with my gp,i seen him today for re occurance of migraines he agreed to refer me to neurologist.",
"now we discussed my diabetes story, he goes by what the blood result tells him the hba1c of 5.2, and says that result tells him i'm not diabetic, then he turns round and tells me that my fasting result which was 6.6 was abnormal, i told him that result of 6.6 would suggest pre diabetes, he said no that is abnormal that suggests diabetes.",
then i said if 6.6 is diabetes then why you telling me i'm not diabetic he said because of your hba1c result which is 5.2.,
so obvously my gp doesn't know what he saying.,
then he turn round and said to me your getting anxious because of your fasting result but i'm saying your hba1c is telling your fine.,
confused ?,
yes just as me first he says my fasting result is abnormal and suggests i'm diabetic and then on the other hand he says i'm not.,
anyway my blood tests that were done were the hba1c test last week dx abt 3 weeks ago.,
dont know where the results were sent didnt really ask.,
"but one thing that the gp said to me and made me think was that the hba1c is a test done to check level of glucose over 2 to 3 months, what he said was that the test revealed that there was a slight peak towards the end of the result.",
"so got me thinking , could be wrong, but this is what i thought the slight peak towards the end, could be the start of my diabetes as i really only felt ill abt 3 to 4 weeks ago, that peak could be the rise of my blood sugar but taken over the whole 3 month sand the average worked out and the result is 5.2.",
this was my hunch maybe i'm wrong but just got me thinking what the gp said that's all.,
"as for the savoury things i've started to cut down on them anyway and really see what difference it makes to the blood sugar, been pencilled in for a dietician so see what advice he or she gives.",
keep you posted on this saga.,
thanks eggie hi hanadr well according to my gp my hba1c is quite normal at 5.2.,
"my gp reckons at 5.2 i'm doing quite well even my diabetic nurse says so.as for testing, i do home testing and it varies quite alot, i get results ranging from 7.1 upwards to abt 16.1 but that depends on what i eat.",
when i eat cornflakes and some milk and have a cup of tea along with it my bs goes up to anything at 16 which is high but according to my gp its fine.,
normally my gp is good at his job but when it comes to diabetes i think he ain't got a clue.,
"since i tried to explain to him the symptoms i get when my sugar is high all i get from him is dont test at home, at present i'm getting leg cramps also and sometimes pins and needles in my fingers along with dead legs but again he says evrything is fine i worry alot.",
he reckons i do alot of internet reading and make myself anxious abt thinking of the word diabetes.,
i told him evrthing i read is for my own use and knowledge but he just dont really wanna know.,
"also which i didnt know until joining this forum was abt foot problems, i think my diabetes must have gone undetected for some time now as i do have both toes with ingrown nails they do give my pain when knocked, i dint know that before, so another trip to the gp and what he as to say abt it.",
knowing him he most probably say i'm getting anxoius and stressed for nothing as usual but as fordperfect states in the above post from yours i need to know where i stand.,
"from all the symptoms i'm 100% certain i have diabetes, but my gp is looking at my hba1c count at present and not convinced at all.",
so going to be hard to convince him.,
thanks eggie hi stew i got one from my diabetic nurse which a accu chek compact the one that uses the drum reel.,
"i do watch what i eat very carefully, trying to cut down on heavy carbs.",
the reading which i got at 16 was from eating cornflkes with milk along with a cup of tea.,
was quite shocked at that reding so cut out all cereals for time being.,
"thanks eggie etmsreec said: hi eggie, you don't mention whether you're on any other medications or not.",
are you?,
your gp might try a fructosamine test instead of/as well as the hba1c.,
"stuff that destroys red blood cells at an accelerated rate can ""fool"" the hba1c whereas, for whatever reason, fructosamine tests don't get fooled so easily.",
the latter is less widely available than the hba1c but it's still a good double check.,
"steve click to expand... hi steve was taking metformin slow release once or twice a day depending on how much food i ate, took them for about 2 weeks and then had my hba1c done and result was 5.2. when i was one metformin i realised my bs was stable floating at around abt 6 -7.",
"but since the result of my hba1c i was told to stop taking them and ever since i stopped my bs readings have crept up, but gp not really convinced i need to start them again.",
"he aid come back in december 2009 for another hba1c test, but sine you mentioned the fructosamine test i try an get the done and see what happens.",
thanks eggie hanadr said: eggie i have read his whole thread through again and i'm still confused.,
i wonder if your gp is too :?,
.,
have you ever had an oral glucose tolerance test?,
that's the only official diagnostic test.,
hba1c 5.2% could be high blood sugar non-diabetic or very well controlled diabetic.,
"since the confusion seems to be over the diagnosis, i'd go back and ask for the ogtt.",
getting a 16 on a finger prick test is pretty close to diagnostic.,
it would be very unlikely for a non-diabetic to see that level.,
"good luck hana click to expand... hi hana my gp is just truly focussing on my hba1c test which was 5.2 , but most of state 5.2 is high for non diabetic or low for a controlled diabetic, as i was on metformin 1 or 2 tabs xr version and had been on them for abt 2 weeks prior to my hba1c test, i know 2 weeks won't dramatically lower my hba1c count but it must make some sort of compensation the to the result.",
i did ask for the ogtt but refused for now he said wait till december 2009 for the next hba1c test and see what needs to be done from there.,
so wait and see what happens in december and what my result comes back as.,
got a good feeling it's gonna be well over 5.2 this time.,
thanks eggie,
what is the best sort of cream for a diabetic (t1) to use on their feet to keep them soft and moisturised?,
i have searched the internet and there is a lot of controversy over what to use.,
"also, whilst on the subject of feet, does anyone use a jml shower feet?",
"as we only have a shower so our feet don't have the chance to soak in a bath i thought this may be a good idea, not only for my diabetic son, but also for all of us to use (or shouldn't we share?).",
i have read in other posts that any cream with urea in is not good for diabetics to use.,
"i do already have some aqueous cream but as this normally used to wash with, is it alright to put on the feet and leave until it soaks in?",
please help.,
i have type 2 and am having trouble controlling my bg levels.,
my problem is that i also have diverticulitis and cannot tolerate fibre or wholemeal products.,
"i have eggs for breakfast and porridge with semi-skimmed milk, no sugar and cinnamon.",
but is there any cereal i could have for a change?,
jokalsbeek said: short answer... no.,
"cereals are usually wheat/rice/corn based, with added sugars.",
"long answer, you might make some yourself using chopped nuts and stuff like extra dark chocolate chips or berries?",
any reason why the milk is semi-skimmed?,
full fat slows down the carb uptake and prevents spikes.,
(full fat greek yoghurt would be even better!),
click to expand...,
i thought semi-skimmed would help with weight loss especially as my husband has high cholesterol .,
during the day i eat really healthily (i think).,
salad and fruit for lunch.,
1 slice white bread.,
dinner is meat and 2 veg and fruit and plain yoghurt.,
no snacks.,
i only drink water and black tea and coffee.,
i am desperate.,
help.,
"greetings one and all, i wonder if anyone can tell me if it is fine to use nutella as a spread on wholemeal bread.",
"if not, any advice on what i can use?",
thanks for your help and happy readings.,
"hello catherine, thanks for the information.",
"as a ""newbe"", i am wide open to advice from those who have been there and done it so to speak.",
i take 2 metformin tablets a day and seem to be coping well with it.,
"the only thing is, i feel peckish and am trying to widen the range of food i can take in between meals.",
good luck and happy readings.,
doug.,
"hello all, thanks for the info...love the look of the bread karen and will give it a go.",
"at the moment, i only test my urine twice daily at various times.",
"i will be seeing my diabetic nurse next week for ""another armful"" to be taken.",
my initial readings were quite high...27.4 with a cholestrial level of 9.,
they have dropped dramatically over the last fortnight so am much relieved!,
the tablets (metformin and simvastatin) seem to be working so hopefully further good news next week.,
i am not over weight and my b.m.i.,
is 23.4 so am fortunate i don't have that to battle with.,
"my urine level was above 2% and is now down to between 0.1% to 1% depending on time of day, what i have eaten etc.",
i keep a full record of everything i eat and drink...that's not difficult as i have cut out alcohol for a while and just drink tea with skimmed milk and water.,
i was at our surgery last wednesday and had over an hours chat with the dietician.,
came away very reassured and armed with plenty of leaflets.,
she explained that it will take time for everything to settle down so not to get uptight.,
so i will carry on fine tweeking as i go.,
"anyway, good luck and happy readings.",
doug.,

hi folks hope you can help.,
the next in my battey of tests that i have had since diagnosis in august is a glucose tolerance test next monday.,
"i sort of understand what happens - take blood, drink glucose, take blood etc.",
but what is the purpose of the test.,
if they have diagnosed my diabetes with fasting blood tests what will this show that is any different?,
thanks in advance for your help :?,
chris hi thanks for responses.,
i don't know why i need to go really as my first fasting test was 10.7 and second 11.4 so that seems pretty conclusive to me.,
i will go and have it done anyway and see what happens after that :| chris trinkwasser said: (they probably get a bonus for not prescribing test strips) click to expand...,
i seem to be fairly luck in that i get strips and lancets etc.,
on prescription well so far anyway!,

hey have you seen the new version 'twisted creme egg'.,
looks a lot less messy to eat - not that i will get the chance anyway :cry: just been out for a meal and been a bit naughty as had lasagne and chips - did have a bit of token salad to go with it - guess i will be logging on about 3am after a trip to the loo and to drink a pint of water - sometimes it is worth it though :twisted: :twisted: chris ah now i haven't been told to take anything with me tomorrow - only a book to read as i will be there for 2 hours!,
looking forward to it even less now you all say the stuff to drink is yuk :cry: it's funny i used to be able to drink sweet stuff like hot chocolate a couple of months ago but tasted hubbys the other night and it was horrible - must be because i have not had much sweet stuff over the last few weeks - my taste buds have changed chris,

"several months ago, i was having a lot of problems with numbness/tingling in my hands, feet, and right quad, almost exclusively occurring at night and/or upon waking.",
"if i laid down long enough, something would go numb.",
"they would wake back up when i moved them though, but skip the buzzing stage that usually happens when your limbs fall asleep.",
"i was under a doctor's care (for a whole host of symptoms...terribly insomnia, gastro, menstual issues among them).",
i got tested for vit b12 and vit d deficiency.,
"i corrected it, but it didn't help with the numbness/tingling issues, i've also been tested for pre-menopause, diabetes, thyroid issues, polymyositis, chron's, lupus, etc.)",
everything is fine/normal.,
i'm not even pre-diabetic.,
"because of my other symptoms, i suspected that i had celiac/gluten intolerance.",
"i cut gluten from my diet, and after three days, the numbness went away (actually 90% of my symptoms went away).",
since the numbness had spread to my face the very last day i felt it (while i was awake) i was ecstatic.,
"unfortunately or fortunately, i was mostly just eating meat, veg, and fruit those days.",
"the first time i ate a gluten-free product made from corn meal, my hands/feet went numb again.",
it only happened that one night/morning instead of three.,
"it happened again three times: when i had wild rice, sugar, and bananas.",
i cut all grains and sugar from my diet then (except potatoes and all fruit but bananas).,
"the numbness in my hands and feet stopped, all except for two accidents.",
i tried a vitamin and woke up with numb hands.,
turns out the vitamin used polydextrose as a filler (i thought it said no sugar on the label instead of no artificial sugar).,
"i also tried to add normal, white rice back into my diet and had the same numbness problem.",
"luckily, it didn't linger.",
none of this numbness happens right after eating though.,
it happens hours and hours later (except with the chocolate bar(sugar)...that time it happened within about 30 minutes or an hour...but i was also laying down).,
i've asked several of my doctors if this numbness thing could be a blood sugar problem.,
"they say no, but they've also said a whole lot other boneheaded ****, so my trust in doctors is fading.",
"i've seen two family practice doctors, a pa, a neurologist, and a gi, no one knows anything.",

"i've only gotten this far from internet research and trial and error, and darn it, i need to know what i can safely eat and what i can't.",
i've unintentionally dropped from 150 pounds to 116 pounds since july.,
i'm fading away.,
thanks for taking the time to respond.,
i don't really expect anyone to know what's wrong.,
this is something of a hail mary pass on my part.,
the weird thing about my weight/diet right now is that i'm actually eating slightly more calories (100-200 calories) and a lot more fat than usual.,
i'm also a bit less active.,
i shouldn't be losing.,
"from age 22-33ish, i kept myself at 130-135.",
"i ate low-ish carb and lifted weights, tracked my macronutrients and gym time.",
"i gain weight easy, so if i indulged a bit too much in treats/carbs, i'd buckle down on my diet and lose the two or three pounds i'd gained.",
that didn't happen often though.,
i only slid to 150 because i got injured and got into a living situation where i couldn't cook for myself.,
"i had to eat what most people consider ""normal"" (higher carb and fat, lower protein, higher sugar, more processed...and all horrible for my metabolism).",
"when i initially started losing, i thought it was because i was cooking for myself again and eating what works for my metabolism (healthy, whole foods mostly, low-ish carb).",
then i thought it was perhaps because i was so ill.,
"i've lost weight in the past a few times, and it's slow and requires a lot of work.",
"i tried the fodmap diet for a couple of weeks because of ibs type issues, but ate whatever i wanted.",
still lost weight.,
then i had to go back on gluten for celiac testing.,
i ate tons of carbs for a couple weeks.,
still lost weight (and got even more ill).,
"then i moved to grain-free, sugar-free for the last four months.",
my calories have been consistently higher and my fat intake higher than what kept me at my set point for years.,
"if anything i should be slightly gaining or staying the same weight, not losing (and not at this rate).",
my body is acting like i'm at a 400-500 calorie deficit per day.,
"i'm about to add another meal/snack into my daily intake in an effort to address this because i refuse to be 36 years old and under 115 pounds at my height, unfortunately, i'm not sure if i can handle more calories.",
"i've never been a big eater, and i never had to be before.",
eta: i just saw your edit about testing for diabetes.,
"the tested me during my first round of blood work (my fasting blood sugar level, i think?).",
it was normal.,
i've since had bloodwork done while non-fasting a couple more times and no one's been concerned about the levels then either.,
"yeah, it totally sucks!",
"the really annoying thing is that i've seen dozens of instances online where people have asked about this exact same problem on forums/health advice sites, so i know i'm not unique in my situation.",
"however, the posters never come back to explain if they ever found out the root cause of their problem.",
"one thought it might be a ""blood sugar thing,"" which is why i came here.",
"my brother has diabetes, so i wondered if perhaps this problem might be somewhere on the spectrum.",
i saw an allergist several months ago.,
"he said didn't think i was having an allergic reaction to anything (just intolerances), and according to him the tests aren't very good/reliable for that.",

"one thing seems obvious that my needs are going to outweigh needs of others and possibly my job, very shortly and maybe i dont mind the dieting etc and hard work if i am receiving a well balanced relationship i hear people saying you silly soft stupid sod, grow up, but some of us need that other positive half or something like that hi ladybird64 i did same other day called at tesco and bought some chicken fillet in breadcrumbs and some roast potoates, and i was struggling to move in a couple of hours, having said that i can eat crisps chocolate etc and not have the same effect, and i love cheese to nibble on, usually edam or mozarella, also i havent mentioned this i was told i had osteo arthritis in my hips and back years ago and spondolosis was mentioned plus in my neck and upper back, and i did have a few previous back injuries (soft tissue they said) i have started today to try and take my tablets i have been given, metformin 850mg x 3 plus ramipril, gliclazide, ezetrol, i also had blood tests about 1 month ago, they struggled to get blood and it was very thick, and very dark.",
i will think about posting what i have had it wont look good though,
ok so was told to expect this as bs drop but now its 'arrived' am not happy usually have 20/20 and no probs so this blurriness and out of focus malarkey is actually making me feel quite queasy.,
also plays havoc with attempts to read and surf and other things that take mind of things.,
nurse said last week when i asked that it will go away eventually - varies for people.,
appreciate that no certainties etc but wanted to know others experiences of this.,
"also, when i (finally) get stable and lower bs readings will blurriness automatically come back when it rises again or does it have to be prolonged as in undiagnosed problems.",
thanks l thanks for the replies think i would cope a bit (just a bit mind) better with the whole idea of diabetes if i felt well.,
i cant believe how since diagnosis everything has gone to hell.,
"im sure some of that is anxiety but until i found out, i only had about 10 days of thirst/nocturia symptoms at the most, most acutely over 2 or 3 days (hence my visit to gp) but apart from this i felt absolutely fine and functioned as i always had.",
gp couldnt believe it when results came back later that day due to overall lack of more symptoms and thought it must be summit else.,
"obv had the illness prior to this (you dont get to bs of 27 in two weeks i was reliably informed by a diabetologist at 2am, who also icidentally brought me to 0.5 bs in 3 hours and told me 'the battle begins now' :evil: ).",
keep asking why i feel so ill now and told its 'probably' because bs is coming down and not stable yet.,
am desperate :roll: to be stable.,

"i have noticed lately my bp is going really low, over the last 3 weeks i have been getting readings in the 113/65, but over the last few days it's been going too 108/64, i am on bp tablets and also have been doing a fair bit of exercise lately, but what is the lowest it can go before i should start worrying?",
or ask doctor to take me off tablets.,
mileana said: do you feel dizzy when getting up suddenly?,
feel faint?,
"if yes, round about now.",
"in general, a sensible bp is considered to be 100 plus your age, not higher than 140 systolic, over 50 plus your age diastolic, not higher than 90.",
"ideally, it would be around 120/80.",
"90/60 is considered 'too low' by most, so you're getting there.",

"yes sometimes i do go dizzy if i get up fast, do you think i should tell the gp, it used to be around the 135-146/80-86 before i changed diet, lost weight and exercised regularly.",
"i defiantly don't feel unwell, and only occasional dizziness when i some times jump up fast, thanks folks i will mention it to gp when next go.",
"well that was fun, i went to see my gp and amongst other things mentioned my low bp, so he tested my bp and wouldn't you know it after getting readings at home of 108/64 to 115/64 it was 146/82 when he did it and would not come down, don't you just hate it when that happens.",
"he said it could be my cuff bp monitor, and then said a possible reason why i am going dizzy especially when i am exercising could be the tablets i am on for my hypertension (bisoprolol) which reduce heart rate and these could be hindering my exercise as well, i was noticing my heart rate was low when doing cardio exercises.",
"at which point he said he will change them to a better one ramipril which are an ace inhibitor and will help with your diabetes as well,?",
"so rather than me stopping the tablets i ended up on different ones, the thing now is since changing to these i feel worse my heart rate has shot up and when on treadmill my hr is around the 138bpm from 126bpm without them, my bg has also gone up a little to, it feels like my heart is going to leap out of my chest making me a little worried.",
"i still get dizzy only now more often, i appreciate that my body will need to adapt to these new tablets but i was not expecting such varied side affects with them.",
has anybody else had these side affects with these tablets and will they help my db.,
more a curiosity than anything... my hayfever has kicked off big time over the last couple of days and for anyone who has it you know just how horrible it can be.,
i spoke to the chemist in boots who said that they are expecting it to be a pretty bad year this year.,
what joy!,
i was just wondering if anyone else suffers from it and whether it has any effect on your diabetes - blood sugar levels etc.,
"i'm already exhausted from the constant sneezing, itching nose and eyes (oh, and i get the joy of ear-ache as well with hayfever!)",
and it's only been a day and a half!,
hi all.,
i have been doing the insanity workout.,
has anyone tried it.,
i'm t1 and have been for 3 yrs now.,
i thought of exercise like i use to pre t1.,
i use to train hard but when i was diagnosed i fell apart.,
3 yrs on and insanity caught my attention.,
i took 6 months deliberating the challenge.,
i bought a cycle and tried that but that did not capture my attention for long.,
but i kept coming back to insanity.,
i purchased insanity from someone who had not got round to opening it.,
bargain price.,
it sat in the cupboard for further 4 weeks and 8 days ago i unwrapped it.,
8 days in and feeling tired but exhilarated.,
sugars in range when doing so and after.,
i aim to post here periodically with progress.,
just wondering if anyone else had tried it.,
[thumbs up sign] sent from the diabetes forum app cheers i'm hoping to go the full 60 days.,
sent from the diabetes forum app andy & pez the updates will follow.,
i had not done any training really for 3 yrs and went straight into it.give it ago.,
i want the tshirt too 52 days to go hopefully it won't kill me.,
i am drinking a carb drink between 35_70 grams in 500mil bottle.,
i can already see the transformation in my body long may it continue.,
i'm eating about 4000 cals each day.,
and i'm still hungry.,
insanity is that i look like the people in the background knackered.,
45 mins session omg it's mad guess why they call it insanity.,
bring it.,
sent from the diabetes forum app how do brett.,
either way go for it.,
i make of at home know what your saying regarding missing a session almost stopped tonight but pushed through.,
it's like an addiction i can't leave it alone.,
i will have to dig out my heart monitor to make sure i'm safe.,
i have a 7 yr old who makes sure i complete it a bit like shaun t in the room with me.,
lol.,
sent from the diabetes forum app yes she does not let me get away with anything even jumping in to rep it out with me.,
where does the energy come from.,
keep it up andy post some of the t shirts you got in your endeavours.,
hopefully i'll get mine on here once completed.,
brett good luck post here your thoughts once completed.,
heads up the first 5 days i was stiff and could have thrown it in but gang on in there.,
i am mr inflexible which did not help.,

catch you all soon with progress report.,
keep up the good work everyone.,
sent from the diabetes forum app update.,
well straight in from work and into the routine.,
my sugars were 12 prior to starting which is usually ok as the come down.,
felt very strong for about 20 mins of pure cadio.,
all down hill then.,
lol.,
i hung in there not compromising quality.,
but man it was intense.,
post sugars 9.,
feeling much better now.,
think i got my lunch time in the wrong place as usual today has been manic.,
2 nd time i have done the pure cadio and it ain't getting easier it's the opposite.,
how's everyone else doing in their bid for fitness.,
sent from the diabetes forum app so far my sugars have been little up and down ill post them against the activity at the end of this week so there will be two weeks to compare.,
feeling it now tired that is i'm hoping as the weeks tick on my energy levels will increase.,
my diabetic nurse has kindly given me a ketone monitor to check i'm being sate as exercise like this can affect this aspect.,
let the madness continue.,
keep it up everyone well done for today's fitness to all following updates to follow.,
oh.,
the carb drink i am using provides that little extra boost and prevents hypo.,
i'm going along the tact of keep my level high about 10 to 12 and sort them out later once i have recovered within 2 hrs they are back between 5 and 10.,
which is what my diabetic team are happy with.,
sent from the diabetes forum app,
i always arrange eye appointments on a day off and walk to and from the hospital as it is close by.,
next month i have to go on a working day and take time off work.,
usually i would wait a couple of hours or so after the eye drops have been administered before driving.,
i have tried to find from the dvla if there is any official policy on this but can't find it from the website.,
can anyone advise on this?,
i have taken 2 x 500mg metformin by mistake what should i do?,

hello.,
i have recently been diagnosed type 2.,
i am awaiting appt with diabetic nurse in two weeks and ave ordered a meter to test blood levels.,
"when the doctor first diagnosed me and gave me a quick chat on diabetes i told her i had varied breakfast cereals-bran flakes,shredded wheat.",
"wholegrain porridge,no sugar alpen,all with a sprinkle of canderel.",
she told me they are fine.,
"yet im told to avoid carbohydrates,which these cereals do have.",
surely these healthy cereals cant be bad thing to eat?,
"i can understand not having flour,bread,cakes,biscuits,pasta, but healthy breakfast cereals ???",
thanks for your replies.,
pinkorchid said: as you have a hiatus hernia you will probably need to be a bit more careful with your diet i don't know about cereal but it is said you should avoid high fats amongst other things.,
advising you about diet here is more difficult given your additional problem what you eat will have to suit both diabetes and hiatus hernia .,
you really need to google it to research it but this is one web site that gives some information about it http://www.webmd.boots.com/healthy-eating/guide/hiatus-hernia-diet-tips click to expand...,
"thanks for all your replies,appreciated.",
i have medication for the hiatus hernia before i knew that i had diabetes.,
so the acid reflux i had before has completely stopped.,
"i was eating chocolate,cakes,biscuits etc with no reflux.",
so to be honest diet wasnt a issue with my hiatus hernia once i received medication.,
"now i have diabetes all those sweet,high carb foods i was having before have gone anyhow.",
"this morning the shredded wheat,milk i had totalled 20 grams of carbohydrates,and i put no sugar on them.",
i will obviously take a blood reading once i get my meter to see what difference it makes.,
"i understand carbs are bad,however,surely foods with fibre like shredded wheat,all bran are essential part of a healthy diet too ?",
we have to eat some carbs dont we?,
"i saw a comment by someone in the ""5"" club that they eat 120 grams of carbohydrates a day..",
please help..i now have a bg meter.i dont understand why my readings are in mmol/l ?,
when people are mentioning a hba1c/mgdl readings ?,
do i have to convert?,
if so how please?,
my fasting reading- pre breakfast this morning showed 4.8 mmol/l & my two hour after my 40grm bran flakes/canderel sugar/milk showed 6.7 mmol/l .,
is this normal/good?/bad?,
hi.,
i just wondered whether any other t2s out there have had terrible problems with metformin?,
"upon diagnosis i was put immediately on standard met, which gave me so many problems (constant toilet runs, bloating to the point of pain, nausea, horrendous cramps, etc).",
"i've finally got a sympathetic dr to put me on slow release met, only to find its actually worse!",
"anyone else had this and, if so, did you get prescribed anything else instead?",
not sure how much longer i can deal with feeling constantly ill. .,
.,
.,
thanks a mil.,
hi chook!,
thanks - its nice to know i'm not alone.,
"i was originally put on 1 in the morning and 1 in the evening, but it was the one in the morning that gave the worst symptoms.",
the doctor who gave me the slow release said to maybe take both doses in the evening when i have my evening meal - so i tried that and i could barely get up in the morning i was so poorly.,
"i've gone back to the original 1 and 1, and its slightly better than double dropping, but things are still not great at all.",
"i basically have to plan my day around where the nearest toilet it - and when you have an hour's commute, that can be quite stressful!!",
!,
any link between diabetes and these monstrosities??,
"have a major one brewing on bottom lip as i type and feel totally rotten, swollen gland the lot be at least 5 years [before diabetes] since i had a cold sore this bad.",
"been slapping zovirax onto it, went and bought that compeed but the patch must have blown off when out on motorsickle earlier i noticed a laser thingy in boots earlier but was 39.99 mebbe give it a whirl if i get many more cold sores like this, also i try to take a multi-vitamin every mornin but got complacent because i had'nt had a sore like this in 5 years, more fool me",
hello there!,
"this is my first post my name is robyn, i'm 23 and was diagnosed in the year 2000.",
i was just wondering if anybody out there in the uk is using the dexcom g4 cgm system?,
"i am very interested in using this system, and will be making calls on monday to the manufacturers, etc, to enquire about availability and pricing for self-funding.",
"however, whilst on the manufacturers website (http://www.dexcom.com/en-gb/dexcom-g4) they give a link to the ""local distributor"" at the bottom of the page, which redirects you to http://www.advancedtherapeuticsuk.com.",
"however, when on this site there is no mention of the dexcom g4 cgm system, only the previous system: dexcom seven plus.",
does anybody know where someone in the uk can buy a dexcom g4 system?,
"or if it is not yet available here (and if so, when will it be)?",
"i read somewhere that it was available with some sort of pump, but i don't want the pump - only the cgm system.",
"i am also wondering if anyone out there in the uk is currently using the g4, or even the seven plus, and what your opinion of it is, where you got it, etc...",
"i personally believe that it would significantly improve my life - so much so, in fact, that i am fully willing to pay through the nose for it, haha.",
but i believe that the price would be worth it for what i would get: a healthy life.,
"plus, i don't plan on being on it for the rest of my life - but feel that it could help teach me how to look after my diabetes without it.",
"i won't go into all that now, but yeah i just wanted to see if anyone has any information about the dexcom g4, when it will be available, or anything at all like that...",
i will post my findings here on monday/tuesday after calling the appropriate people.,
thanks a lot!,

anonymous question submitted: hi - i am a 47 yr old male with type 1 diabetes for over 30 years.,
my last hba1 was 6.8 and it has been low 7s for a number of years.,
i have been on warafin for 7 years also (irregular heartbeat - af ).,
today i visited a podiatarist (nhs) who took my blood pressure from my ankle and told me there was evidence of calcification of the veins in my legs.,
i exercise daily and am not experiencing any pain/discomfort or any other symptons.,
i would be interested if this has happened to anyone else and what treatment if any is appropriate - supplement or medication.,
the internet mentions vitamin k but also suggests this may counteract the warfarin - is there anything else i can do and what is the long term effect of this condition?,
any feedback would be appreciated - thanks for taking the time to read this.,
"to submit a question, please go to http://www.diabetes.co.uk/ask-an-anonym ... stion.html",
i'm really struggling to get enough of a drop of blood from fingertip.,
"i wash my hands in hot water beforehand, i did try squeezing hard but then told this was a bad thing, i'm using the sides of my fingers, having to prick about six or seven times each time before i've got any blood, and because at the moment i've only got 10 lancets i'm re-using, is that ok?",
but i don't think that the reusing is the problem because tonight when i finally got success it was on about the fourth attempt.,
what i did in the end was use an elastic band round my finger like a little tourniquet.,
is that ok?,
"mine goes from 1 to 7 and at the moment i've got it on 5, every time i've put it up a notch it hurts a bit more lol.",
but then i am a total baby when it comes to needles - i will just have to man up a bit more!,
i've got some different lancets coming in the post that i bought on ebay - have bought 50 lancets and 50 strips because i don't know how much my gp is going to ration (he did say he would prescribe).,
sent from the diabetes forum app hi everyone!,
well had much more success tonight!,
"( although the actual reading was a little disappointing - 7.6 two hours after dinner) i :- 1) used my little finger 2) whirled my arms round and round 3) washed in hot water 4) squeezed just a little, gently, and quite far down the finger away from the site 5) pressed the lancet really hard against my finger before clicking that was my most drama-free prick so far )) sent from the diabetes forum app ambersilva said: which lancing device are you using?",
if i am using a similar device i will send you some spares.,
click to expand... oh that's so sweet!,
it's a freestyle optima but in fact i'm ok now because the spare lancets arrived this morning.,
thanks anyway!,
sent from the diabetes forum app hanadr said: i never use fingers nowadays.,
my freestyle lit allows alternative site testing.,
"it also allows ""top-up"" for the strips.",
i test on my fore arm and never waste strips.,
"i set my ""stabber"" to 1 or 2[of 4] and change lancet when ithink about it.",
i suspect finger pricking causes toughened skin and makes the next test more difficult.,
ast is plenty accurate enough for monitoring daily .,
it might not give a sufficiently accurate result if tracking a hypo recovery.,
"also it's so painless, i sometimes don't feel it at all.",
hana click to expand...,
if using the forearm is ok then why don't more people do that?,
seems to me just instinctively that it would be much less painful?,
what with our fingertips having so many nerve endings.,
maybe i will try that too because my instruction book (which i have now found ) mentions alternative sites sent from the diabetes forum app,

"i have been a diabetic for approx 7 years and have been diagnosed as type 2 diabetic by a previous doctor, i am 63 years of age..",
i had a new doctor examine me yesterday who was surprised i was type 2 as i follow none of the ordinary rules governing this e.g.,
"not overweight, i am physically fit, no family history etc.",
"i am on insulin, having previously on metformin as only this seems to control my blood sugars.",
she suggested i might be type 1 diabetic with delayed onset; that is a big delay!,
has anyone come across this before ?,
or any comments ?,
thanks in advance john lazybones said: diabetes as you will know is defined into several different groups and in general we diabetics fall into one or the other groups.,
there are however a few individuals who border on a particular group and may encroach into another group and in fact then be classified in more than one group.,
some diabetics start off as being classified as type 2 and over time the need for insulin becomes apparant and they are then classified as type 1.5 diabetics or sometimes (possibly miss-classified) as type 1's.,
"a 'gad' blood test will generally show if the individual is truely a type 1 diabetic in the true sence, in that their pancreas has failed to produce insulin so i would suggest that you contact your new gp and ask exactly why you are now considered as being classified as a type1 diabetic as this isn't something that any of us can truthfully answer without knowing your full medical history and what the recent blood test show.",
please let us know what transpires - best wishes - lazybones.,

thank you for your response.,
i will be sure to do that.,

"thank you for your reply, that is very interesting and i will research it back guylan thank you catapillar said: type 2 doesn't turn into type 1.",
they are two entirely separate conditions.,
"you might have been misdiagnosed type 2 and always actually been type 1, but type 2 doesn't turn into type 1.",
type 1 is an autoimmune disease.,
ithere immune system gets bored/confused and decides to kill off the insulin producing beta cells in the pancreas.,
"type 1 is clinically acute onset: very high blood sugar (30+) and ketones on diagnosis, dramatic untried for weight loss peer diagnosis.",
there are antibodies associated with type 1 and a positive gad test will confirm type 1.,
"but a negative gad test is not definitive, about 25% of type 1 are gad negative.",
type 1.5 is type 1.,
it's just a colloquial term for people diagnosed with type 1 when they are older who retain endogenous insulin production for a while after diagnosis.,
"it take a while for the immune system to kill off all of the beta cells, it doesn't happen in one fell swoop.",
the period when a type 1 retains insulin production is known as the honeymoon period.,
for someone diagnosed with type 1 later in life they may have a particularly strong and long honeymoon period which may allow them to avoid insulin for a while.,
"type 2 diabetes is anything that isn't autoimmune diabetes (type 1) or genetic diabetes (mody), or other defined types of diabetes (3c, ndm).",
there are plenty of type 2 diabetics who are slim and fit.,
there are plenty of type 2 diabetics who need insulin.,
"neither of these factors make them type 1, they continue to be type 2 diabetics treated with insulin.",

thank you for your excellent response.,
i now have a better understanding which is always good,
"i was 7.1 before dinner, two hours later i have gone up to 11.1.",
i don't understand why.,
i had pork chops for both breakfast and lunch ( i wanted to see what would happen if i had no carbs earlier in the day).,
for dinner i had a leek cooked in butter with a dessert spoonful of full fat philadelphia cheese and a smoked haddock fillet and a coffee with 60ml double cream.,
has anybody got any idea why i would get such an increase?,
i have been seriously low carb since the end of january and i am starting to think that i am doing something wrong...,
"thanks everyone, i have checked the weight and nutrition labels (yes i have been rooting in the bin yuck) and it is less than 100g of protein for the day.",
i will make a note in my food diary for future reference and hope for a decent fbg tomorrow.,
i'm off for a pint (water) and then my bed.,
sweet dreams all.,
"x grantgam said: although i'm t1, if i ate what you ate - i'd have an increase in bg.",
for me it would be a combination of the protein and the high fat levels.,
the protein gets turned into glucose when i eat lc (gluconeogenesis).,
the fat causes me temporary insulin resistance which results in a delayed bg rise.,
click to expand...,
i had no idea that fat could have this effect.,
something to factor in... freema said: the excess eaten proteins many times is only transformed onto glucose very slowly in some people and ind some situations... when i do a lot of exercise it seems my liver is overactive transforming proteins into glucose....no matter how long i exercise i never get low in blood glucose...,
i think it differs from one person to the other.,
"most people only need like 0.8 grams of protein pro kg body.weight a day or 0.35 grams pro pound of bodyweight... so a person of 100 kg would need like 80 grams of protein a day, and preferably shared over all 3 meals a day...to be able to use it all, or after exercising... unless one is a body builder, then the person need more protein daily... if one is very low in calories the body can also change protein from ones muscles into glucose... especially if one eat too few proteins... it is common though that diabetics type 2 have an overactive liver... actually most have a somewhat raised liver activity in the mornings , some much more than others... click to expand...",
i definitely have an overactive liver.,

since the end of february i have had a diabetic ulcer on the back of my ankle.,
i have always taken good care of my feet inspecting them reguarly and when the back of my ankle became sore i visited my doctor who presecribed an anti biotic cream and i also covered the area.,
despite the fact that there was no visible wound initially it became infected and continued to get worse despite various antibiotics.,
the situation now is that i still have the ulcer which causes quite a bit of pain and is preventing me from driving.,
i am having it dressed twice a week and every 3 weeks i see the tissue viability clinic.,
"it have regular swabs done and it shows no sign of infection, but little sign of healing either.",
"i am monitoring my sugar levels closely and keeping it in single figures, erring towards too low than too high (last months average 6.3) i have backless shoes and slippers and during the day wear a tubi grip stocking to help improve circulation.",
i do have neuropathy though still have sufficient feeling to be aware of any injury.,
"the only advice i am given is to keep having it redressed, to both rest and exercise!, and to accept that it will just take a long time!",
"it is now putting my employment in jeopardy as the inability to drive, stand for long or walk up and down stairs easily has meant a combination of working from home with an occasional lift in by colleague or taxi.",
"i am over the official retirement age but if i were forced into retirement because of this before 2014 when i intended to retire, it would be a financial disaster for me.",
you can understand why therefore i am anxious to try anything that might speed up the healing process.,
i am wondering what experience others have had and whether there might be alternative treatments out there which could help.,
to give an idea of what is involved i have a picture but rather than present this to everyone (as i know some people are upset by graphic images) i have uploaded to my drop box.,
"if you feel you might be able to offer some advice and need to see it please visit this web page https://dl.dropbox.com/u/134019/ankle.jpg i appreciate this is not a medical forum but would it be worth my seeking alternative medical opinion noblehead said: the only advice i could give is to ask your gp to refer you to the dermatology clinic at your local hospital, apologies if you have done this already!",

i looked into the maggot treatment but this is only incidated where there is still infection present and successive swabs have revealed it free of infection.,
"i have also found out about a new product developed in cuba which has recently been licensed for production in spain but have not been able to find out anything about it in the uk - http://heberprot-p.cigb.edu.cu/ hanadr said: ps i've never had an ulcer, but i have found that i heal at normal speed.",
[ i came off a bike and healed normally and without scars] i've put this down to very tight blood glucose control i e around 5 at all times hana click to expand... would that i had done that but like many new diabetics i went into a kind of depressed denial for the first couple of years.,
the other factor is that i had severe pancreatisis a few years ago so even keeping tight control the readings will jump up and down for no obvious reason.,
my original levels had reached almost 30 before the diabetes was even diagnosed and have no idea how long it might have been - the likelehood is that a lot of damage was done early on.,
i did improve the feeling in my feet by taking control so preseumably reversed it a little.,
"thanks for advice and i will see this weekend how the honey based dressings work update - unfortunately the honey dressing did absolutely nothing, if anything it made it worse.",
a week or so later it got much worse having developed another infection and i ended up in hospital for three weeks on intraveinous antibiotics.,
i have since come home and they are treating with multi layer bandaging which they are still changing 3 times a week.,
"by the time i was in hospital it got so bad that the archilles tendon was visible and extremely painful, their concern was the bone but a scan revealed no infection there - it is slowly, very slowly healing again but i reckon (assuming the current rate of progress continues) that it will be some weeks before it is even close to how it was when i wrote the original post.",
tomorrow i am being seen by an orthapaedic specialist with a view to fitting a removable cast (something i suggested to them from a post here over three months ago!),
with a view to keeping the ankle joint rigid to give it a better chance of healing.,
i just feel so frustrated because so many of the things that i suggested over the months were brushed aside by doctors and nurse specialists who kept telling me it was fairly superficial and would just take time.,
why oh why did they have to wait until it was visibly very bad before trying these things.,
in my view the nhs is incredibly short sighted when it comes to giving pro-active treatment.,
if i had been given a cast at the time when it was mainly a surface problem i think it might well have healed and would have avoided the cost of a 3 week hospital stay and countless trips to hospital by ambulance.,
"even in the latter they are shortsighted because i have a locally run voluntary car and driver service which charges about 40-50p a mile and nothing for waiting time - however they will not refund the cost of that, insisting on ambulance travel (ambulancee car or minibus) which i know is many times more expensive.",
little wonder that the health service is critcised for its lack of efficiency.,
"if they reacted as well to minor - medium issues as they do to a crisies, they could save a fortune as there would be far fewer critical cases in the first place!",
for example they know in the early stage of diabetic diagnosis that people often go into denial so why not offer more support at that stage - with say weekly clinics in the first few months and even random visits by district nurses.,
getting people to control more effectively in the early stages could save millions in later complications - you get more help giving up smoking than you do giving up the foods that you have loved all your life.,
i have been on victoza 1.8 injections for nearly 18 mths in which time i have pilled on the pounds... has anyone else experienced this?,

"hi steve, good for you, sounds as though you are well suited to this med.",
i've actually managed to gain 18 kilos since taking it :-( not funny if you are a stocky chap to start with.,
"i had a recent set of bloods done and i went online to check my results and seen the efgr result there when previously it had never been recorded.............or at least never sent to my gp, where the online database gets its information..........",
"anyway, what are peoples experience with this............. my reading is low and from a google, says stage 3 kidney disease............ no doctors have been in touch yet.......... should i make contact with someone..........?",
"my creatinine is 74.0 umol/l my egfr is 59.0ml/min the egfr figure i have is from a website [mydiabetes, myway], along side my other readings, so it must have been input from someone.......... is it just a calculation..........?",
"i am not aware of the results of my urine test yet..... you have all been very reassuring, thank you..... will see what my doctor says.....",
"there is no urine test result up, if there was protein would that cause a 59 thanks, already on lsinopril...... hopefully hear back tomorrow for a chat about it..... time to pull the finger out regardless.....",
"i heard back from a nurse who said that the way the egfr is reported is that if it is 59ml/min or over, then the figure on the sheet will read 59, even though its probably higher than that......... so good news in a way, going to get the consultant to confirm...... its been a scary few days, so still highly motivated to lose some weight and get the bp down.......",
i wonder if anybody could help or give benefit of their experience.,
"i am type 2 diabetic, diagnosed about 9 months ago.",
"i dont have to use insulin, but i do take metformin (1000 mg * 2 a day) i am quite overweight, and my blood pressure is higher than normal (high normal according to doctor) for about the last 4 to 6 weeks i have noticed bubbles or foam when i urinate.",
"this only happens when i urinate directly into the water, and it doesn't happen if i urinate against the bowl.",
i get quite stressed and worry alot about any health issues (real or imagined) and so i went to my doctor.,
he seemed to just brush it off and said that when i had my last review (about 3 months ago) they tested for protien in urine and i had no problem.,
he said because i was diabetic i would see this sometimes and it would come and go.,
"my blood sugar is well under control (always between 5 and 6 mmol normally, and 6-8 after a meal).",
since i have become diabetic i have probably eaten a lot more meat and protein as i have stopped eating so many carbs and i think this might not be good.,
i drink a lot (too much) of diet coke and other caffeinated drinks.,
i think i drink a normal amount of fluids overall.,
"sometimes i have some degree of a stinging sensation after i urinate, but not really bad.",
i am not using any special toilet cleaning products or anything different to before.,
should i be worried?,
should i go back to see a doctor and ask them to do more tests on me?,
"i am conscious that it is quite easy to put any symptoms into the internet and come away convinced that you have a serious condition, but it is making me quite stressed at the moment.",
"a lot of people in here are not using metformin and control their blood glucose by diet and excercise alone... wow i was put on metformin right from the start but didnt actually know anything about anything about diabetes type 2 except from that it had something to do with sugar which diabetics could not eat .... now i think i have managed to get my number in control into the non-diabetic area... but now wonder is metformin doing its job , and how much does metformin in fact help lowering peoples blood glucose... do any of you know more of how much in general metformin does help lowering blood glucose ?",
i just read this study : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9428832 http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/35/2/446 but as i read it it seems metformin only lowers blood glucose like something in between 0.6% and 2.0% and in my eyes that is yes ridiculously little... like if one had a raise of blood glucose of 100mmol it would only lower the number by 2.0% and that would leave the person with a number of at least 98mmol then... did i totally misunderstand the results here ... hope so but i am not that clever in reading scientific texts... what do you know of this ?,
"grantgam1337 said: hi @freema , i think you may be interpreting the results wrong here...",
i'm pretty sure the percentage reference is with respect to the old fashioned hba1c dcct units of measurement.,
so a reduction of 2% is actually huge.,
5% (31mmol/mol) = avg bg 5.4mmol/l; non diabetic 7% (53mmol/mol) = avg bg 8.5mmol/l; diabetic.,
that's how i'm interpreting the results anyway; i could be wrong... click to expand... 2% that is of a number of 6.0mmol only about 0.12 mmol i think that is hardly anything.... if one has an average blood glucose of hba1c 50 (iffc) then the reduction is 1.0 and the result would be an hba1c of 49 then... would you count that in another way ?,
pinkorchid said: metformin is also supposed to protect the heart as those with diabetes are more at risk of having heart problems.,
my doctor thinks it is worth taking it for that click to expand... yes thats what all doctors are tought from the medical company/ science and probably it does help but if that help of protecting the heart is like like helping 0.001% is it then worth to take the risk of not being able to uptake vitamin b12 over time and risk neuropathy just from a lack of a vitamin one would otherwise have been able to uptake....?,
"maybe i do not understand the way they use the percentage- this writng seems to tell of a much higher reduction, like up till 12 mmol of the hba1c which is a lot more and something more substatial... http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/35/2/446 grantgam1337 said: from the first link you provided: "" the corresponding between-group differences in glycated hemoglobin (hba1c) ranged from 0.6% to 2.0% at dosages of 500 to 2000 mg daily, respectively. """,
"hba1c used to be expressed as a percentage, and i think in this example is with reference to the dcct units of measurement.",
so a 2% reduction in hba1c is (for example) 7% to 5% or 53mmol/mol to 31mmol/mol.,
"from the above example, a 2% decrease in hba1c (measured in old dcct standards) equates to a reduction of 22mmol/mol (measured in ifcc new standards).",
"click to expand... oh in that way it is a lot more... than i understood.. that would mean that my resent number of 34 / 5.8 have been helped down with about 2.0% and would have been like 7.8 if i didnt take my metformine , if the metformin works optimally in my case ?????",
i johnegreen said: one thing it does do is suppress apatite and in that my doctor agrees though when i said about protecting the heart and nervous system as possibilities i had heard mentioned he did laugh to my chagrin but then what does he know he wants me to take statins that's when i laughed.,

"hi, i have been having pains on my sides lately.",
"this has happenned before in the past, usally due to high blood sugar but usually went away.",
my glucose is fine but i have been exercising recently.,
i normally do moves that require flexing the sides and they can become sore.,
at first i had pain after each workout but now it has extended to more than a few days.,
it has also stopped on one side and now the pain is just on the other side.,
i just visited my doctor before the pain started and she said that she wanted to do a test on my kidneys and keeps hinting at kidney disease.,
i have been drinking lots of water to hopefully counteract any issue but could this be something really bad?,
this has never happened before.,
"at this point, as bad as it sounds, i am wishing it to be something like a kidney stone rather than kidney disease.",
this is my ultimate fear and it is starting to make me feel depressed.,
"hey synonym, wow that is so true i am totally ignoring my own advice lol and i am choosing to cry.",
i totally agree with what you said and the exercises that i did were new and rather intense.,
i could have over done it.,
the pain seems to be going away which i will assume is a good thing but i do plan on taking the test as soon as i can and just get over it.,
:wink: will keep you updated.,
"gem hey synonym, wow that is so true i am totally ignoring my own advice lol and i am choosing to cry.",

gem jen&khaleb said: i've had kidney stones and you really don't want them.,
extremely painful!!,
hope you don't have kidney disease and my only comment besides going to see your hp is that if you are drinking loads and loads of water you can actually make your kidneys work harder and overload them.,
i was so worried about my kidneys that i drank 4-6l a day and it actually made things worse.,
best of luck.,
"jen click to expand... hey jen, i was totally shocked when you said that too much water can make your kidneys work harder...too much of a good thing can be bad for you huh.",
"i always thought it was best to overload rather than to go thirsty, will stop that asap.",
(sorry about your kidney stones.),
"thanks gem hi tracey167, i am beginning to think this was a muscle strain because it has suddenly left, although it did last almost a week.",
at one point i considered it to be an infection because the pain was so intense but i was just wondering what causes kidney infections?,
"gem hi sue, wow it sounds like you have been through alot with those kidney stones, i can only imagine what you have been through.",
thank you for the advice and sharing your experience.,
i plan on taking the kidney test as my doctor prescribed but this is not a good time at the moment for me so i have been holding off.,
"the pain has gone away so that was pretty good and as for drinking water, the advice i got via the responses were quite conviencing so i slowed down on the intake.",
"my numbers are a bit high for my kidneys since my last blood test and i have been trying to figure out why and the initial thought was ""drink more water"" and i still feel that way.",
but thank you again and i will be doing that test in a few weeks and will share the results.,
gem,
can anybody point me in the right direction for sugar free soft drinks?,
"newly diagnosed with diabetes and dont see the nurse at diabetic clinic for 3 weeks, fasting level 9 - 12 and 2 hours after food 15.4 - 16.3.",
before being diagnosed i put the excessive thirst down to my medication amitriptyline and can drink upto 2 pints of fluid overnight.,
"thanks for the advice peeps, looks like im gonna have to try bottled water (flavoured), i just can seem to drink plain water, is tea ok with one sweetener and a dash of semi skimmed milk?",
"bananas are my favourite booh hoo, looks like im gonna have to find a different one now.",
hello can you tell me please the carbs and calories of 1 chip / french fry?,
"i understand that 1 chip of mcdonald's is different to 1 chip from fish'n'chips shop, as it's much thinner.",
i would like data for the biggest possible chip.,
i can't find any.,
"also, i would like the same for crips and tortilla crips.",
it will be that way much easier and accurate to track my calories and carbs.,
thanks!,
"i don't mean oven chips, i said french fries in my question guys come on!",
i don't know how many chips to eat that will be 100 calories!!!!,
himtoo said: with respect is your plan to eat 1 chip or french fry or 1 tortilla or 1 crisp as a portion?,
because if it is not the query becomes irrelevant and costly due to waste instead weighing the portion and knowing the amount of carbs per 100 grams is the most reliable way i have found to measure what i eat.,
however to answer your question as asked the following as a reasonable guideline 1 chip ( approx 14 grams ) 4.36 carbs 1 french fry ( approx 6 grams ) 1.9 carbs 1 tortilla chip ( approx 2 grams ) 1.4 carbs 1 crisp( walkers approx 1.3 grams ) .85 carb click to expand... what chip is 14 grams really?,
and isn't chip and french fry the same thing?,
i am fed up with these terminology issues,
please move this thread if it is in the wrong place as i dont know if it is the same as pre-diabetic.,
"i was told i am glucose intolerant on friday but i would like some help, so i will try and be as brief as i can with my story.",
"i am 31 years old, 5ft2 and 14stone 4, i have a club foot which means i am not very mobile making exercise almost impossible, i also have an underactive thyroid.",
"i have had 3 utis in 3 months, all being treated by antibiotics, but samples have come back clear other than a small bit of protein and a trace of blood in the first one, the last water infection i had happened on 9th february, i was at work (i am a check out clerk), i started feeling strange like i was watching someone else working, my head felt odd, and i came over really hot and dizzy, and i immediatly came over really sore and had to go to the toilet, it got worse and i went to the toilet again then felt unable to work as i couldnt concerntrate and felt really ill and sick, i knew i needed to eat something before i could drive home so i sat in my car and ate a sandwich, within about 20 minutes i felt ok and drove home.",
"i went to see the nurse at my gp surgery the next day and was given some more antibiotics, (this is the protocol for utis at my surgery), i went to see her primarily about the water infection and took a sample with me, which came back clear, but i mentioned how i had been feeling that that i had been drinking litres of fluid a day but was still getting utis, which she said shouldnt be happening, so she took a finger prick and 2 hours after eating porridge it came back at (11.9), i was booked in for a fasting test on the monday and was asked to get tests at a gum to rule anything else out.",
the fasting test came back at 7.5 for both my sugar and my cholesterol after 12 hours of fasting.,
the initial gum tests have come back clear.,
"i ended up going back to see the nurse this friday because i was still suffering uti symptoms, but the nurse wouldnt let me have any more antibiotics and this was when she told me the results came back that i was glucose intolerant, i was given a sheet of what to eat and asked to see her again in 2 weeks time.",
"every day i start to feel dizzy and shakey when i get up, i am also drinking and weeing more than normal, getting up at around 2am and 5am as i am woken up needing to go, i then have a drink and a pack of belvita biscuits and feel better, because i then go back to sleep.",
"i ended up going to a&e this saturday because i was having pains in my stomach and i was weeing blood, i was kept in for 8 hours, not allowed to eat but was constantly drinking, but still felt thirsty and when i was checked i was told i looked dehydrated too, after tests to see if i have a kidney stone, i was let out with strong antibiotics for an acute uti, and told to see my gp when i had finished them, the blood test came back as 10, again 2 hours after eating porridge.",
"the reason i am not convinced i am just glucose intolerant is because everywhere i have read, it has said people dont get any symptoms, but i am feeling ill and tired all the time.",
i am also going to get a monitor as soon as i can because i want to be able to relate how i feel to what my sugar is actually doing.,
"thanks for reading my essay, any help will be appreciated.",
tammy thanks louise.,
its good to know that i am not the only one who thinks the nurse may have been slightly wrong.,
"i am still feeling ill, and eating does make me feel better, but i have heard that just because i feel hungry i may not ""need"" to eat, which is why i want to start monitoring, as eating when i dont need to will make things worse.",

"with regards to a diet, where do i start, other than looking at the hand written sheet i was given, with regards to ""restricted"" foods?",
"i dont ""want"" to be diagnosed diabetic, but i would much rather be diagnosed if i am, rather than trying to cope on my own with an incorrect diagnosis of glucose intolerance.",
wow thanks for that.,
"here is the list that the nurse wrote out for me, some of it includes what to reduce for cholesterol too.",
"my other problem is i have ibs, which i am on medication for, so i have modified what i can eat to control that, so i will be starting from scratch again.",
"was told to cut out sweet things where possible cereal - porridge/shredded wheat/wheatabix/special k bread - wholewheat, max 4 slices a day pasta/rice, brown if poss - 3-4oz portion (cooked) a day potatoes - 3-4 egg sized/medium jacket a day bananas - 3 per week milk(semi-skimmed) - max 3/4 pint a day cheese, low fat - not restricted cheese, hard - 2oz a day eggs - 3 a week yoghurts(low fat) - one a day meat - white/lean/cook healthy (red not good) fish - very good prawns - avoid all some shelfish - avoid most veg - no problems fruit - 2 portions a day drinks - low sugar oils/marg - high in poly or mon unsaturates and thats all i was given.",
"xyzzy, this is actually starting to make sense now, thanks i guess it will be a case of trial and error, and close monitoring, but im determined to work it out.",
"i think i need to go shopping and get a load of healthy foods in tomorow, and see if i can get a monitor too.",

is that good or bad?,

i just thought i should bring this to peoples attention.,
i have now got some sticks and gone back to my freestyle and although high my highest has been 10.1 not in the 12s.,

"the more i hear, the less convinced i am, shame really.",
"hi, i am new here.",
i just wanted to ask a question because there seems to be so much conflicting information online.,
i have just had a blood sugar reading of 2.9 and want to shed some light on it.,
i have not been diagnosed with diabetes.,
however my dad and most of his family do have or have had diabetes.,
i have recently been given a blood glucose meter by a friend and some test strips.,
this is because i often feel weird if i am overly hungry and just wanted to see if my sugar was low.,
"i also have been having a few other potential symptoms such as frequent urination, sweats etc...",
"i have only tested a few times and generally from what i can make out the readings seem ok. fasting in the morning it has been 4.6, and 2 hours after eating it has been 6.",
except the other day where 1 hour after eating a bowl of custard with bananas it rose up to 9.6 - is this ok?,
so today i have been busy but i have eaten.,
"for breakfast i had a bowl of fruit and fibre, and the same for lunch as i was busy.",
at around 3pm i had a fig yoghurt and a banana and a small piece of chocolate.,
at 5pm i had 2 handfuls of cheerios (i should stress that i don't normally eat such a lot of cereal - i was just putting the box away and my daughter asked for a handful so i did the same).,
at 5.30 i started to feel faint - it felt like the blood was draining out of my head.,
i sat down and put my head low between my legs.,
i also felt a bit shaky.,
i checked my sugar and it was 2.9.,
i panicked a little and put my mouth around the squeezey honey and took a big swig.,
i opened the fridge and had a glass of apple and pear juice.,
my hands were quite shaky.,
15 minutes later sugar was up to 4.6 then shortly after 5.2.,
i still feel quite strange in the head.,
"could anyone offer advice on what is going on, and whether i should be concerned about this?",
should i chat with my gp?,
sorry about lengthy post just trying to provide as much info as possible.,
"thanks, sam.",
hi thanks for replies.,
i think i will book a gp appointment today.,
i;m not sure if this is new or not really.,
i am pretty sure that i have had low blood sugar level symptoms for a while but have not had means to test them.,
maybe a year or two.,
appreciate the help.,
"thanks sugar2, from reading i did last night i agree, it doesn't seem like a typical diabetic symptom.",
"i guess my concern comes mainly because i had eaten regularly yesterday, and this happened 20 minutes after having two handfuls of a sugary breakfast cereal.",
"maybe because i had so much sugary stuff yesterday, my body produced too much insulin?",
"anyway, got an appointment just to make sure.",
"thanks again, sam",
having only recently diagnosed with t2 i've been doing a low carb diet.,
currently about 80 g per day.,
it seems to be working well and bg seems to be falling.,
"however, when i look at what the nhs recommends a t2 should eat, it seems almost opposite of what i'm currently eating for my low carbs diet.",
so is there anyone on this forum that follows the nhs recommended diet and still controls their blood sugar?,
it's not easy to totally go against my doctor's advice on what i should eat.,
zand said: do you test your blood glucose levels?,
i would go by what your meter tells you.,
"it's your health at stake, not your gp's i saw a dear friend stick religiously to the nhs guidelines.",
her bgs weren't well controlled even though she eventually ended up on insulin.,
she became just another statistic and lost a leg.,
click to expand...,
i do test my bg every day at the moment.,
in the few weeks before i was officially diagnosed my bg was mostly around 14 and sometimes a bit higher.,
"since diagnosis about 3 weeks ago, and as a result of joint this forum, i have been working to reduce my carbs intake.",
this has resulted in my bg falling to around half of that and as an example my pre dinner bg has been below 6 for the last few days.,
i'm just curious if anyone is controlling their bg by following the nhs dietary guidelines.,
thanks for all the replies.,
i've no plans to abandon my low carbs diet.,
i just find it hard to understand why the official nhs dietary guidelines appear almost exactly the opposite of what seems to work for most people on this forum.,
i've been experiencing pins and needles on the hands and feet.,
"this would happen when i eat certain foods like pizza, crisps, or orange juice.",
i went to get tested for diabetes and the test came back all clear.,
still i would get this wired sensations of the hands and feet along with fatigue and after eating salts and sugars.,
it usually goes away when i stick to brown break and non sugars.,
i had this on and off when i relapsed.,
eye test came back normal later that year.,
last year the doc dismissed it and said adamantly there is no such thing as pins and needles after eating.,
i've never felt so embarrassed and left.,
this year i eat something and it sends my body into such a state.,
"i can't eat anything without getting symptoms like this burning sensation, creeping hot and cold feeling on hands and feet upper leg and pins and needles under armpit and upper arm.",
and i also get upper abdominal pain as well as wired cramping of the lower stomach region.,
"i get so fatigued and i go to sleep and on waking, my fingers and thumb feels really numb and the upper arm feels like blood runs cold.",
"i've seen a different doc and got tested for diabetes and something else, i'm not sure of.",
that was a week today and its flipping bank holiday so can't get results now.,
"two weeks ago, i read that these symptoms could be hypoglycaemia or something.",
it could be a result of gluten allergy?,
i've seen an out of hours doc and i've had breakfast before i went and she told me my blood sugar was normal.,
i'm 30 years old and i've had these symptoms for just over two year on and off.. is this the point of no return?,
"will these sensations get worse like they have been doing, despite keeping to a low carb diet?",
"sorry for writing so much, i needed to get it all out and i have no one to talk to who understands.",
i've never felt so vulnerable and i hate it.,
i'm really desperate to know and it's bank holiday.,
i feel like i'm loosing my mind.,
arab horse said: sorry to hear your health issues.,
hopefully you will get something done soon.,
if you don't get any further with your dr you are entitled to ask to be referred for a second opinion.,
i can't offer you any advice as it really needs a good dr to either find what is wrong or refer you to someone who can.,
good luck and let us know how you get on.,

thank you for your comment.,
i'm seeing the other doc now.,
he seems more competent and he's easy to talk to.,
i'll let you know when i have the results.,

thank you for your comment.,
i'm not sure if i was tested for b12 deficiency.,
i will know tomorrow morning.,
the nurse took 3 blood samples when i went to the clinic.,
i'm going for an eye test tomorrow and then i'll make the call to the gp.,
"the doc said something like ""i'm going to test it against everything"".",
"not sure, i couldn't take it all in.",
i'm a week into the low carb diet.,
i really should do more research on it.,
i do miss chinese chicken wings though.,
hi everyone.,
i called front desk at the gp today and i got the all clear.,
i shouldn't ignore what i've been feeling though.,
i've gotten use to the new diet and i'm going to stick with it.,
i've been trying to do some research into this as it's something that has been preying on my mind of late but can't seemt o find any definite answwers.,
there seem to be a few people on these forums who are t1 and have t1 children and i also know a few families where 2 or more siblings have diabetes.,
does anyone know the facts and figures on this?,
what are the chances of passing it on or is it really a 'do all you can while pregnant and hope for the best' type situation?,
i'd love to start a family but i would be devastated if i passed my diabetes onto my child/ren.,
"for me personally i'm the only one in my family that has diabetes, my mum thinks her cousin may have had it but that's the closest link, i'm an anomily!",
there's no diabetes in my partner's side either as far as he knows.,
i know there's a lot worse conditions to have and nobody can give me a definite answer but i'm interested in other peoples experiences/research if there is any!,
"thank you for the replies, i am indeed a t1.",
"that article was very interesting, it seems that the risk is less than i thought but still a risk nonetheless.",
"i've found it really hard to find any information specific to t1, there seems to be a lot more research for t2 genetic risks though mostly related to pregnancy.",
"i'd be interested in hearing from any t1s who have had children with or without t1 thank you for your post bentley's girl, that's really interesting and i totally agree with your sentiment that there are worse conditions to have!",
"that's interesting skid, thanks.",
i'm sure i read that it's common to miss a generation so that sounds totally plausible.,
when i was diagnosed i know my mum felt very guilty as it was only her cousin who had it but that was still the nearest relative.,
i guess the odds are with me but it still gives me pause.,
"the thing is,i was diagnosed at 17 so i have always been able to take care of myself and my control has always been acceptable/good, i've only had one instance of a really bad hypo and that didn't even end in seizure.",
i have gigantic respect for all the parents of diabetic children and i've been reading a lot of posts here and on other forums from parents of children with diabetes and it seems like kids have it a lot harder than i ever had.,
"i'm not saying i wouldn't be prepared to care for a child with diabetes, far from it, i just know my heart would break if they had a bad time of it with hypos and seizures and having to wake them 4 times a night to check their blood sugar and god forbid if something worse happened and i would blame myself for my bad genetics.",
hi just considering whether or not to try the patrick holford low gl method but have a few concerns.,
some of the menu options on the diet look as if they will spike me quite badly.,
( like eating 4 oatcakes at breakfast for example ).,
i realise that it is the combination of foods on the plate that is what appears to make the diet work - but am worried that it will raise rather than lower my blood glucose.,
i am on a lowish carb diet at present but am on the verge of losing too much weight ( 5'1 and 8st 6lbs ) and the holford book keeps talking about mega weight loss which i don't need.,
has anyone been on this low gl regime?,
"if so, what effect did it have for you and were you are you happy on it?",
my last hba1c was 5.9% but i feel i have had a bit of a honeymoon period and things are seemingly not as easy as they were - i.e my sugars seem a little higher in the last few weeks which has prompted me to look into low gl.,
your thoughts would be gratefully received - just feeling a bit overwhelmed and slightly negative!!!,
cheers cathy n thank you all for taking the time to reply with such thorough advice!!,
"catherine, i think that the crux of this is just what you said - personalising any diet is what has to happen, and at the moment i'm really feeling like i just need someone to tell me exactly what to do and how to do it!!",
"i'm in a bad phase and i just want something to be the magic thing that works, so that i can stop thinking about diabetes 100% of the time!!",
"i'm giving it a go, anyway.",
thanks again everyone for taking the time.,
cathyn,
"hi anyone, i'm just new to this forum.",
but i would like to ask you a question regarding what i have on mind.,
if the question is not applicable to this thread please do let me know.,
my question of concern is that; how should we get prepared for post postprandial blood sugar test on the day of testing.,
following is the instructions that i have been given to follow; test instructions eat a meal that contains carbohydrates.,
eat the entire meal within 15 minutes you should rest during the 2 hours between the meal or drink and the blood collection.,
"do not smoke, eat, drink, or exercise during the 2 hours.",
these activities cause the blood sugar levels to be falsely low or falsely high.,
return to the lab two hours after completion of your meal.,
your blood will be drawn again for the 2 hour postprandial blood sugar (glucose).,
why is that they are asking to eat a meal that contains carbohydrates when i have high blood sugar?,
why should i finish eating the entire meal withing 15 minutes.,
i hope i'm not asking too much questions.,
but i hope i'm not out of limit.,
any help on this would be kindly appreciated.,
thanks in advance.,
"hi all, we are just in the process of being taught carb counting prior to my daughter ( 14 year old type 1) before being given the accu chek expert bg machine, so she can start to calculate her own bolus and give herself a little more freedom.",
before we can have the machine we need to complete several weeks of diet sheets to show that we can work out the carbs ok and they can also calculate her carb to insulin ratio.,
"i thought i would start out simple with pasta but i am already confused the packet states allow 100g per preson of pasta, and the nutirional information states that 100g (cooked as directed) is 32.3 g carb.",
does this mean that if a weigh 100g grams of dry pasta and cook that will be 31.3g of carb or is that 100g pasta cooked !,
hope that makes sense.,
all help greatfully recived,
"hey all, i hope this is okay to ask here.",
wasn't sure where else to post.,
"i was diagnosed t2 back in march, and today i had my first diabetic review with the nurse.",
"in a nutshell, it was bad.",
"but after a long talk with her, i am feeling positive about getting on top of this, finally.",
"the issue i have is, i have been prescribed statins.",
this has freaked me out.,
my cholestorol came back as 'high' at 5.4.,
"from my understanding, it should be under 5.",
"now, here's why i am confused.",
"last time had my cholesterol checked was 5 years ago and it was exactly the same, and back then i was told it was all good, just a tad over but certainly nothing to worry about.",
now with the same result i get put on statins.,
"the pharmacy mucked up my prescription and i need to go back to the doctor for a new one for these statins, and i want to question the reason for going on them (the nurse didn't offer any explaination).",
"but before i go in there and start babbling like an idiot, i was hoping some of you guys on here could shed some light on why i might be put on them, if you can.",
"i admit i don't know much about these meds, other than my dad was put on them after he had his first heart attack (he was also diabetic, t1 i believe) and so naturally this has freaked me out.",
"that it really any info/experience gratefully received thanks for that, more fun and games to look forward to :lol:",
my last hba1c was 5.7% but recently for an unknown reason i've been getting very high blood sugar readings and higher than normal... just did one and got a level of 27.9.,
just wondered what sort of levels you should show a worrying concern to?!,
"re: what do you consider a dangerously high blood glucose le hey guys, thanks for all the advice!!",
i know it's a very late reply i couldn't remember my password!,
"in the end, the on-call doctor came out and took 4 hours to get to me so by the time i'd been seen and had a lot of insulin to manage it, my bg was back in the ""normal"" zone.",
since then my insulin has been adjusted!,
with the job i do lows and highs can catch you out with every measure in place not to!,
also my diet is very good being the reason it took this long to diagnose me!,
"thanks for all your replies though its very much appreciated, great to know you're not always alone!",
just wondering has anyone ever had any troubles with the equipment being faulty?,

all of that is writen with a microscopic letter i ask: why it is not accepted from the forum staff criticism about low-carb diet?,
is it because off the commercial consideration?,
is it wrong the people shod know the consequences of extreme lov-carb diet?,
why you remove the threads who debate that?,
"there are many ""why"" tim2000s said: you have received a pm about this luna.",
"in response to your first comment i've quoted though, there are rather a lot of people on the forum that have reduced or removed complications as a result of a very low carb diet.",
there are also some that have seen issues.,
"dr bernstein himself advocates very low carb to do so, so you will need to demonstrate what you mean by consequences with evidence.",
click to expand... hi tim i do not agree wit you.,
all of you speak of the positive effects on the lowering the glucose in the bg.,
"it is truth, but it is the only one side of the results.",
all of you forget or do not know the second consequence of the diet.,
i write about the extreme low-carb as some one say 5 to 10 gram carbohydrate per day.,
this kind of diet can be fatal especially for diabetics.,
"if this ""doctor"" bernsein has been a real doctor then he will newer accept the diet with 5 to 10 gr./day carbs.if the person eats to mush lipids and very low amount of carbohydrates, then the liver mobilise fa's (fatty acids) from the adipose tissues and the mitochondrial beta-oxidation in the liver will produces to mush ros (the reactive oxygen species) that are a very injurious to one's health, because they attack the cells membranes.the blood of the person will have huge amount of fa and it will have negative effect on his health.",
"the consequences on long term use of this diet result in: atherosclerosis, diabetic retinopathy, infections, cataract, hypertension and renal disease.",
"your dr. bernstein must know about that, or he is only doctor of name and not real doctor.",
everyone who study medicine know about how the liver works i.e.,
all about metabolism.,
"it will be impossible to me to give all of you evidences about my claims, but you can begin to study in medical literature and you will get this evidences.",
do not ask dr. bernstein!,
"chrissamsdad said: please post the evidence you have for these statements, then we can judge for ourselves.",
click to expand... for example you can get the evidences if you bye or borrow the volumes: guyton and hall textbook of medical physiology and williams textbook of endocrinology.,
there are many another volumes where you can read about this problems.,

"the basis of most fat-avoiding research and received wisdom - that is knowledge that's gained from text books and teachers and not challenged - is based on some very flawed studies and you're also mentioning issues that are caused by a high fat, high carb diet - it's true if you eat high fat and don't cut out most carbs, you'll suffer all sorts of issues.",
"i can't find a study which supports your argument that a lchf diet causes complications of diabetes, there are a lot of us here who have decreased their blood sugar level down from dangerous levels which certainly would cause the complications to levels which haven't and seen their cholesterol results going the right way too.",

does anyone know how important in the general scheme of things your creatinine level is and what the normal levels should be (if there are normal levels).,
"i ask because i have recently been given access to my ""key records"" (more in a post to come in a few days) and these give hba1c, bp, cholesterol and creatinine levels.",
"there is no indication of a ""good"" range for the creatinine.",
there doesn't seem to be much emphasis on creatinine in either of the two books i have or in the stuff that was handed out by the nhs.,
"the one bit of info i was able to dig up said that it would vary by size (i'm quite big), gender (male) and musculature (i'm much better than i was even a year ago), so that wasn't much help.",
my doctor hasn't raised it so i'm assuming my level is fine and i'm not particularly wooried about it.,
i just wondered if it was generally accepted as a key indicator and how it is interpreted.,
i did a forum search and didn't come up with much but feel free to point me to an earlier discussion if appropriate.,
thanks.,
"i can now see that my current level is 103, which seems to be ok.",
"i can also see, however, that it was 120 in 2007 and 114 in 2006.",

"the doctor is treated as a monarch, the patients like serfs.",
hello everybody!,
i am type 1 since 2004 and my last hba1c was 4.7.,
my previous ones were 4.9 and 5.1.,
i try to take care of myself and i do sports and i eat healthy food.,
"but my doctor wasn't happy with my last result, she started telling me about the consequences and complications (amputations, retinopathy...) of high sugar levels (not my case) and low levels (heart attacks).",
"she also asked me about my sugar levels, and i said that my sugar levels are moving all the time.",
i've always believed that the sugar levels in type 1 were moving always and it's been always like that in my personal experience.,
she said that the sugar levels in type 1 patients shouldn't move and i was wrong about that.,
am i doing anything wrong?,
is she right????,
"because it doesn't matter how hard i'm trying, my sugar levels are always going up and down.",
"i've also mentioned that i should be more naughty and start eating more unhealthy food in order to rise my hba1c, but my doctor never said anything about it.",
what is in my mind is: trying to do the right thing is wrong then?????,
or basically i should change doctor???,
thanks for reading!!!,
thanks catapillar and chalup!,
"she is a doctor catapillar and i think that she was trying to scare me, but i don't know why.",
"i agree with you with your comment (""i can't see any specific reason why your hba1c result in itself would have indicated a particular need to discuss the risks from high blood sugar levels"").",
"complications and my hypo awareness is total, and it's been like that since day one , i said that to the doctor, but she was talking to me as i was diagnosed yesterday .",
"furthermore, i work for the diabetic eye screening and she knows that too.",
"and definitely, i won't start eating unhealthy food, but when i made that comment, my doctor never said anything about it, and that's is really wrong too.",
thanks again!!!,
gp doctor thanks catapillar!!!,
you are a star!!,

hi i feel so stupid asking this.,
i had some rice and on the box it said 61g of carbs per 100g uncooked and when it was cooked i weighed it and it weighed 150g.,
the rice absorbs water whilst cooking so this is why it weighs more right?,
but do the carbs decrease or increase when it is cooked or does it stay the same?,
no doubt this question has been answered before but im rather worried about this constant sweet taste in my mouth.,
"i have diabetes 2 and currently am on the byetta pen (supposed to be non-insulin) im also trying hard to lose weight,but i come up against this each time i make headway with my diet.",

is there anyway to alter this yaste as its driving me crazy now.,

look forward to hearing from you african mango????,
is that mango from africa?,
i will get back to you on the ldl and hdl.,
just so happend i always get a copy of my test results so i can compare!!!!,
"ok total cholesterol is 5.5- 6 months ago was 5.6 hdl is 1.09- 6months ago 1.05 ldl is 3.1 6mts ago, unable to calculate ldl, said higher than 4.5 serum cholesterol gone from 5.9 to 6 now to me things are slowly improving.",

"hello everyone, i've been a type 1 diabetic for 10 years and i'm currently 20.",
"well, i'm kind of ashamed to talk about this but it's been bothering me lately.",
i've started masturbating when i was around 13 years old and i've been doing it constantly.,
"as i aged, i became more addicted to masturbation, doing it several times a day sometimes...",
when i was around 16 i started watching adult content and became addicted to it.,
my problem has always been controlling myself to not do it.,
"in the last years, i noticed that i couldn't keep my erection unless i stimulate my penis.",
it usually goes back to normal within 30-60 seconds if i do nothing.,
"this has became a mental problem for me, but it hasn't stopped me from masturbating.",
i don't control my diabetes that well but my blood sugar levels were around 6.5 the last time.,
"i'm also depressed and have social anxiety, and this is why i chose to masturbate rather than going out and talk to people.",
what do you guys think?,
"is it a diabetes problem, or should i take a break from doing it?",
i also believe i have low testosterone levels since i don't have any facial hair on my face yet.. zand said: do you happen to have blond/ mousy coloured hair?,
if so i think it's not unusual for facial hair not to appear in abundance until you are 25.,
this was certainly the case with one of my sons and some of his friends too.,
"click to expand... --> yes, my facial hair is mostly fuzzy blonde hair.",
i can grow a mustache but after a while it looks ridiculous (typical teen mustache) so i rather shave it.,
"i also shave my chin since it grows some short of beard, but overall it's not thick.",
"i heard some people grow it later, so you might be right about it.regarding my social anxiety, i doubt i can get over it since i've been so for all of my teenage and it's gotten worse.",
it's got something to do with the way i was treated by individuals and that i don't expect anything good from the majority of them anymore.,
"maybe i didn't meet the right people, but i waited too long for that.",
"deep inside that hurts me, since i'd like to be surrounded by a lot of friends and be cool with everybody.",
qe5rt said: i don't think i could maintain an erection without stimulation for a longer period than said.,
doubt it has anything to do with diabetes.,
"there's being in the mood and there's masturbating out of boredom, if it's the later i would think not being able to hold an erection is normal.that said low testosterone levels could be linked to erectile dysfunction (ed if i have to type it again).",
anxiety and depression can also have an effect.,
"and off course everything that can restrict the blood flow to the penis so diabetes is a candidate, but in the longer run.",
but ed usually is a case of not being able to get an erection or being able to sustain it while being stimulated.,
"on a personal note i can't imagine having sex more than once a day (ok, i'm a bit older than you but still) as the second time i would probably not be able to maintain an erection neither.",
"click to expand... --> well yeah, i guess all these things combined could make it worse.",
"i read that depression is a serious issue if you're also diabetic, as it can slow or freeze any attempt to have a good lifestyle.",
"on a serious note, i'm pretty sure that at my age there shouldn't be worries regarding this stuff.",
"i believe every guy my age is able to maintain a erection for good amount of time, even if there is little or no stimulation at all.",
"that said, i'd like to find the issue.",
"being addicted to masturbation, i used to do it everyday(several times a day) till i would ejaculate for the last 5 years.",
"i'm struggling with this addiction, as the longest time without doing is like 2-3 days.",
i could hold up once for like 2 weeks but that was the most.,
"my penis is so sore that sometimes it hurts when i pee, and also my sperm quality has decreased so much that it's only a couple of liquid drops.i had to write this, and i'd like to apologise if my post is too disturbing.",
i'd like to bring in this issue since it's bothering me.,
i think my penis head is less sensitive especially in the upper area.,
one thing i would blame is excessive masturbation and harmful at times.,
"let me explain why i believe this: i used to masturbate when my penis was so sore that i could barely have an erection, yet i still forced it.",
"basicly i used to masturbate till i would ejaculate so that i would feel done.this is a serious problem i've got along with social anxiety, and i believe that i use this to release some of the stress i'm going through.",
please don't judge me harsh or anything.,
could you guys give me some advice on how to fix this issue?,
would taking a break be the best option?,
"it's just hard for me to control though, i always forget about it.thanks",
i have recently attended the first day of a desmond course on type 2 diabetes.,
i came away frustrated because the course tutors were unable to tell me the relationship between the above mentioned two figures.,
"there appears to be a difference factor of about 10, but i am told that one is the average over several months and the other a ""spot"" figure.",
"i know that when i last had a blood sugar test, the figure i was given was 5.1 which i understand is within the 4 - 7 range of being normal.",
"but although the tutors knew the figure of my mmol/mol, they declined to give it to me.",
neither could they explain what the relationship between the two figures might be.,
"i felt as though i was being patted on the head and given the advice ""there there, you have no need to bother your pretty little head with such matters.""",
it was not made clear what the expressions or abbreviations meant.,
"after a lifetime in engineering, i am used to using criteria about which i have been informed.",
"the course was as announced at the outset, very ""structured"" and this structure did not seem to take account of any awkward questions that might be raised.",
i felt somewhat patronised.,
because no-one seemed to even try to answer my question.,
has anyone something that would help me discover the answer?,
thanks in anticipation thanks to both catherine and deejay for your prompt replies.,
"incidentally, i was told because i was taking notes, i was therefore not paying attention!",
this to someone who for years took minutes of technical meetings!,
hi all i've had diabetes type 1 for 48 years and have got proliferative retinopathy.,
i've had vitrectomy operations on both eyes and one eye had a detached and torn retina.,
i've applied for pip but there seems to be a problem with people with diabetes getting it?!,
i can't see my computer screen to work any more so not faking it...!!,
has anyone else been successful in a claim please?,
thank you.,
the form seems to be a lot of questions about whether i can talk to people etc but not about the fact that i can't see them very well it's nice to hear from someone who was successful x hi yes i think atos do them here.,
it does seem a bit hit or miss as to who gets it and who doesn't.,
and the assessments are done by a healthcare professional whatever that means!!,
thanks for all your replies.,
"it does seem, judging by the answers, that you can't get pip on the basis of having type1 which is a chronic illness in itself.",
i've had it for a long time and things are not going well.,
i hope that everyone who has applied and been rejected will appeal as there are very few other conditions which can lead to such horrible complications.,
good luck thank you for your help everyone.,
question is in the title really.,
its 29.99 to sign up for it now.,
"i think there is glitch - i just logged in, and i have to pay to continue, even though i signed up months ago.",
and ideas @dcukmod ?,

this fee is payable quarterly.,

"my issue is that nothing has been mentioned about it no longer being free, not on the forum, or on any of the webpages introducing the low carb programme, until after the person has started to make an account and given personal information.",

hi everyone i am new to the forum but have found it the most useful source of infomation since being diagnosed with type 3 in feb this year.,
does anyone out there know anything about type 3?,
i would be very grateful to throw a little light on the subject :?,
"many thanks thanks i think the type 3c is the closest anyone has got yet, the information is much appreciated.",
"ok i know why freestyle have instigated this code to cover their backs, but i've had type 1 diabetes for 35 years now and i can say i'm pretty qualified to calculate my own insulin levels.",
i would like to have this function as a base level to help calculate my insulin dose.,
problem being my next appointment with my diabetic clinic isnt for another 3 months!.,
if anyone has this code i would really appreciate it.,
"could you email it to me at malcolmsmith_97@hotmail.com and title the email ""freestyle code"" so i can fish it out of my junk mail.",
thanks sooo very much folks :wink: doh!,
oh yes or pm me.,
i hear one code does every machine and its currently available online but i cant find it.,
please if anyone can get me this i would be eternally grateful that's brilliant thanks muchly for that.,
i googled this and never got anything like this!,
thats true!,
but i like the log function.,
"i know the lite version has this sort of function but this one is so much easier to access and read plus you can plug it into your laptop and make a printout (so i'm told, i havent actually done this yet).",
despite the size the carry case isn't that much bigger than the lite version.,
i am still a bit confused by diet etc.,
"i have just had some goats cheese, which is low in carbs and sugar - good for diabetes.",
"however, a few years ago i was on the weight watchers diet (pre-diabetes) and the saturated fat in the goats cheese would have been a big no - no - as would cream and butter.",
so is it a case of one thing is good for the diabetes but not weight loss and vice versa?,
"also, i have been eating a lot of cheese - good for the diabetes i think - but i am thinking this can't be good for cholestoral and will be clogging up the arteries?",
"i had my first tests 4 months back and went to 6.4 (46%), which the nurse was pleased about.",
she said to go back in 6 months unless i wanted a test after 3 months.,
i think i will ask for a test now to be on the safe side as i am not testing myself at all.,
this is all very confusing.,
i lost weight quickly and now it has stabilised a bit.,
all the time i was losing weight i thought this must be good for the diabetes and so i switched off to what i need to do long term.,
thanks for the replies.,
useful as always.,
"previously i was addicted to longley park cottage cheese, which was a big help but my local sainsburys stopped selling it, which is why i have converted to goats cheese at lunchtime.",
pre diabetes i would have had a sandwich or 4 muffins - so a big improvement!!,
difficult to know what to pick up in the supermarket at a lunchtime at work to eat at my desk.,
not keen to do packed lunches (not good at getting up in a morning!).,
thanks again.,
ive been diabetic for 9 years now and for 3 years have suffered from chest pain on and off.,
"doctors said its not from diabetes, its anxiety but i really dont think it is!",
ive been hospital a lot in the past with high keytones and know that that can effect your organs!,
was wondering if this is the reason why i could be having chest pains?,
"no medicines have changed, i can be anywhere and get them, in bed, waching tv, out somewhere, literally anywhere.",
it gets to the point where i nearly have to call an ambulance.,
sometimes its just constant pain and sometimes it comes in sections and gets stronger and stronger.,
"it can sometimes wake me up when im asleep, just want to get it sorted, because with being diabetic i think the worse thank you for your comments, by reading your comments, maybe it is just anxiety, its a horrible feeling.",
i just panic about it thinking im unhealthy or something.,
my bloodsugar is well controlled now and ive started the gym to see if that helps.,
just hope it gets better soon.,
if it is anxiety is there any tips you could give me to calm the pain down?,
"hi guys, i had a very pleasing 6 month review this week, however, i am concerned by my gfr, which is to do with the rate that the kidneys do their stuff!.",
"on my test results, it states that my gfr is 78, which is acceptable, as the normal range is >60.",
"on further investigation, i read that a normal rate is actually > 90 and that a reading between 60 and 90 is an indicator of ""mild"" kidney failure!!.",
:shock: i also read that gfr naturally decreases with age.,
"i do a lo carb diet and the main theme of current advice states that the high protein content of a lo-carb diet does tax the kidneys to a degree, however for normal healthy kidneys, this is not an issue.",
so :?,
": as a 53 year old, t2, is a gfr of 78 acceptable?",
regards steve.,
anonymous question submitted: i was diognosed with peripheral neuropathy about a couple of months ago after suffering this for quite some considerable time without knowing why.,
"my question is will it get worse over a long period of time and cause problems with walking and balance, and what will be the final outcome when this does catch up with me and will it put me in a wheel chair.",
i have started a new drug last night which is called pregabalin will this help to keep the edge of the pain and discomfort that keeps me awake through the night and constant pain through the day and when walking.,
"to submit a question, please go to http://www.diabetes.co.uk/ask-an-anonym ... tion.html/",
i was on the bertie (similar to dafne) course last july and one of the subjects was insulin and carbs.,
however we were told that you wouldn't have to take any insulin with a meal that has no carbs in them eg.,
salad!,
i still don't really feel confident with what they said as i have always taken my insulin during my meals.,
if anyone can help me understand this or if anyone has been told similar i would be very much appreciated.,
thanks only recently that i've managed to get my insulin ratio back on track.,
at the moment i use a 1.5 to 10 ratio which works absolutely fine even though i do get the occasional low blood sugar (dietitian reminded me to change the ratio depending on the meal).,
would the lantus be of help because of it still being in the system and how it works throughout a 24 hour period?,
i know i need to cut down on my carbs...i was diagnosed with diabetes 13 years ago and back then of course they always told you to eat carbs to keep the bloodsugars good and i was on actrapid insulin way before i had to start taking the novorapid and lantus insulins.,
i guess having vegetables would be a better source of carbs and maybe sticking with wholewheat based carbs too i think i feel a bit more relaxed about this now.,
thank you so much for your help guys ^_^ all i do stupidly worry about is that if i was to have a plain salad and not take insulin with it that my bloods would go haywire.,
it's like if i was to have a glass of orange juice with the salad (as sainsbury's orange juice has 18.4g carbs per 200ml) then would i have to take extra insulin?,
"hi guys, my name is steph, i'm 32 years old and have been diagnosed with type 2 since 2013.",
i currently take metformin daily but have been changed today to alogliptin as the metformin was causing stomach problems.,
"my blood sugar reading was also 79, which is very high but also the lowest it has been in 4 years.",
i have never really had any problems before and i suppose i have been in denial and not really taking into consideration my illness at all as i have always felt nothing but well.,
the thing that is bothering me the most is that i have had 'pins and needles'/numbness in my hands and feet continuously for the last 12 days.,
i also have a tingling feeling around my torso.,
the doctor said that she is sending me for tests but i have looked up possible reasons for this on the web (not sure that was a wise move) and am worried it could be neuropathy.,
has anyone else experienced feelings of pins and needles?,
"does anyone know if it is caused by high blood sugar, and also, the most important question is, once my blood sugar levels are under control, will these feelings go away?",
"thanks, steph",
"hi all, about 4 years ago i started taking omega 3 capsules/oil but i found that my need for insulin increased and made blood sugar control really hard so i experimented with different brands etc.",
but with no luck so i just stayed off it.,
lately i've been trying to increase my vitamin d levels and so decided to give cod liver oil a go but unfortunately the same thing has happened.,
"the day after starting on it, my blood sugar shot up and i'm now injecting a lot more than usual.",
it's like having insulin resistance.,
i've searched on google but not really found anything.,
i do remember reading on this forum of someone else who cannot tolerate fish oils but have had no luck in my search.,
i think i'll just have to accept i cannot take fish oils but i would love to know the science behind why it affects some diabetics in this way.,
"i have logged into my profile several times to change my diabetic classification, and hovered over the type 2 (in remission) button.",
there is also a reversed option too.,
i dont really like either term as i just consider myself very well controlled with my last three hba1cs in the mid 30s.,
"i feel i deserve one of the alternative classifications (sorry, blowing my own trumpet ) and i think i prefer in remission.",
shall i change it or shant i?,
what do you all think?,
"hi everyone, just wondering if any of you are in the same situation as me.",
"i have muscles wasting in my one arm, calves and now both hands.my doc seems to clam up when i see him about it.",
is there anyone who has same problem.,
i would appreciate any feedback.,
"thank you for your comments, i am on statins and quite a high dose and have stopped them several times,but each time i have been put straight back on them when i have next blood test....when i next see my specialist, i think this will have to be discussed in detail and see if there is any other option...the neuropathy, well, what can i say.",
"i have both peripheral and autonomic, .",
.,
"thanx again ... rob hi everyone i am sure it could be down to the neuropathies, but i am so confused at the moment over it all.when my muscle first went in my arm, i was told it was because i had used that area for an injection site.a few months down the line and both my hands have lost muscle, thing is i have been seeing a specialist every 4 months for my duypuytrens and he never said a word.it seemed to disappear over days rather than weeks,and now its my calf.",
"the statins,i was on simvastatin for several years, but then (i will explain it the way i was told) i needed to go on the high dose of atorvastatin straight away because apparently statins work in 2 ways,the one way is for the heart and simvastatin wasnt doing that job.",
its this reason why whenever i have come off it as soon as a blood test is done i am put straight back on it.,
"i think all this confusion is caused by specialist keeping me completely in the dark and because of that i now have very serious complications a bit of advice for any one reading this no matter what stage of diabetes you have, make your doctor explain in detail all the serious complications of this awful disease, mine didnt and because of that i have no life due to those 'serious complications' that may have been avoided.",
rob,
"hi all, yesterday my boyfriend purchased only a pumpkin when he went out to buy dinner (men are useless at shopping, aren't they?",
"), although it's very small compared to the ones i am used to.",
(dutch do not celebrate halloween).,
i initially raged at my boyfriend as i am sure i read before that pumpkin is high carb and ridiculously high gi... and i told him this before!,
"however, when i read the label, it said 4g carbs/3.9g sugar per 100g, which is pretty darn low for a sweet vegetable.",
"i'm sure it would be okay since i take insulin, but i am just wondering how you other diabetics have gotten on with it?",
"i adore pumpkin pie and pumpkin soup, i tried those in america.",
"not that keen on making the pie, but soup sounds lovely.",
and boyfriend also suggested making pumpkin mash as a potato substitute.,
oh!,
and what about the seeds?,
i remember i loved those as well in america.,
(this was before i was diabetic).,
"well, after eating pumpkin soup and a slice of bread while cooking the soup... and pumpkin seeds that i roasted.",
i can confirm that pumpkin is great.,
"i felt sick about 20 mins after eating, i was worried that it gave me a spike...",
i was sitting at 2.9 mmol/l.,
but i was so full and didn't wanna eat!,
i've never had a hypo where i was actually full.,
wasn't nice.,
but at least now i know that pumpkin is seemingly fine for blood sugar.,
"hi i`ve been diabetic since 1995, and have never discussed what insulin dosages are considered ""normal"".",
"i take 12 units (max) of humalog for each of 3 meals a day, i weigh 75kgs and exercise 6 days a week.",
i take 18 units of lantus at night.,
my hba1c is 7.,
"the diabetic consultants i see at the hospital are unable to offer useful commentary, and always point to my acceptable results.",
"i appreciate everyone is different, carb intake and body composition differ etc etc, but just wondered what is average.",
"i read online that 40 units of lantus a day was the average, but fear it may have been a us average...",
"thanks rich based on your reply, i could take almost twice the insulin i do (based on 0.5 -1 unit per kg body weight), but so long as my hba1c was ok, it wouldn`t matter.",
"i struggle with this concept, hence my question.",
what kind of dosages do other people take?,
re.,
"eating less carbs/exercising more, as i mentioned i exercise 6 days a week - including 100 miles cycling on average, boxing, karate, circuit training - so my level of carb intake is necessary to fuel this.",
"i`ve no intention of training more, nor of eating fewer carbs, just wanted some guidance on whether i`m taking more insulin or less insulin than anyone else.",
anyone?,
"thanks for the replies - i accept everyone is different, i was just curious as to how much insulin other people take.",
"sounds like the general response is ""who cares, so long as the diabetes is controlled"".",
that works for me!,
went for my for my 3 month blood test today and asked for a print out of my test in february.,
i'm having trouble understanding the cholesterol figures.,
can anyone help?,
serum lipid levels (xe2q7) serum cholesterol level (xe2ed) - 4.5 mmol/l serum triglyceride levels (xe2q9 - 2.2 mmol/l {04 - 1.5} serum hdl cholesterol levels (44p5) - 1.8 mmol/l serum ldl cholesterol level (44p6) - 1.7 mmol/l serum cholesterol/hdl ratio (44p6) - 2.5 mmol/mmol serum non high density lipoprotein cholesterol level (xabe1) - 2.7 mmol/l gfr calculated abbreviated mdrd (xak8y) - 90ml/min?1.73m*2 15-200} serum total protein level (xe2e9) - 73 g/l {60-80} ast serum level (x771i) - 21 iu/l {0-30} so what is my hdl(good) and ldl (bad) and the overall figure.,
"thanks carol thank you, i understand it now.",
"thank you andrew, took a lot of thinking over that.",
it seems that i am not having enough fat to raise hdl.,
"hi guys, a friend lent me a book about cholesterol and statins.",
it's quite complicated (for me anyway!),
"but it devotes a whole chapter to the hpa axis (the system in the body controlling hormones such as cortisol, insulin etc).",
"the authors' hypothesis was that stress causes disturbances in this hpa axis by increasing cortsiol production and that this elevated cortsiol level eventually leads to heart disease, diabetes and other metabolic disorders.",
i'm interested in this as i don't fit any of the traditional criteria for type 2 and there is no-one with diabetes in my immediate or extended family.,
my consultant is not sure which kind i have yet and is waiting to see what happens!,
i do have a very stressful job and a stressful home life.,
i also get worked up and anxious easily.,
is there any connection between diabetes and cortisol?,
"if so, do you know where i can find out more info such as medical research?",
thanks again in advance!,
"x hi there, thanks for answering my post and info re: cortsiol and blood sugar.",
i was diagnosed in july and on diet only.,
i asked for a c-peptide test but consultant said they don't do them on the nhs and even if they did he didn't have anything to compare the results against to tell me what a normal level is :roll: he said they treat adults with type 1 and type 2 the same initially although he did say i could sign up for a research study which would measure my c-peptide level and they would tell me the result.,
so it's wait and see!,
when i was diagnosed my white blood count was very high although there were no obvious signs of infection.,
i've also lost a huge amount of weight even though my bmi was normal at diagnosis.,
weight loss hasn't slowed down and is averaging 1-2 pounds a day even though i'm eating more calories.,
consultant says it's either fluid loss as high blood glucose causes the body to retain water or i have form of type 1 - again it's wait and see.,
blood glucose follows the pattern of type 2 with normal fasting numbers and high post meal numbers.,
a1c at diagnosis was 10% and three weeks later 6.7%.,
if it was a form of type 1 wouldn't this be higher?,
"my diabetes symptoms came on suddenly in the space of a week (blurry vision, running to the loo, fatigue) and this prompted me to go to the gp.",
even though my bgs are now well controlled for most of the day and i don't have obvious symptoms i still don't feel well at all.,
"nothing specific, just a general feeling of being unwell, light headed and tired.",
guess i'll just have to wait and see what happens... xx,
"as a non diabetic, fighting off a common cold was easy.",
"tons and tons of orange juice for the vitamin c, and a spoonful of honey to ease the sore throat.",
but neither of those options look very sensible now i'm a diabetic.,
so how do you cope with a cold?,
i will be highly obliged if my colleagues on this forum can share their knowledge and experience about fruits and vegetables that can be eaten freely by a diabetic.,
are diet drinks available in the market (e.g.,
"diet cola, pepsi max, diet pepsi etc.)",
suitable for diabetics?,
"hi all, i'm new to this so forgive me if it is a question that has been asked before.",
my father has type 1 diabetes and has had his driving licence suspended (he surrendered it) by the dvla as he has had two hypos (one in october and one in november).,
he has since been on a course on how to control his diabetes better (something to do with calculating how much insulin to take according to what he eats) and his bloods sugar levels have never been so good and at a constant level.,
he has however been told by the dvla on the phone that he cannot apply for his licence to be reinstated until 8 weeks before the anniversary of the first hypo which would mean around august.,
from doing some reading on the internet on the dvla and diabetes uk i understand it that if your doctor believes you are safe to drive you can reapply for your licence.,
can someone help me to understand the rules as i can't find anywhere where it says he cannot reapply for his licence but he is a bit of a defeatist and has just accepted it.,
he relies on his licence for work and lives around 200 miles from any family or friends so will affect him badly if he loses his job over this.,
"many thanks dan he did need assistance on both occasions, he was taken to hospital both times.",
he notified the dvla himself and surrendered his licence rather than had it suspended by them.,
hi guys.,
i was wondering if you could help me out....,
yesterday i was potentially going to miss my daily dose of victoza.,
"i didn't miss it in the end, mum to the rescue and all that!",
but it did make me think about what effect it would have to miss a dose.,
im type1 but have pretty bad insulin resistance so i've recently gone on 1.2mg of victoza on top of my insulin and metformin and as a result my insulin doses are much lower than they were.,
would i just get a raised blood sugar for a while?,
thanks in advance for any thoughts!,
thanks for the info and ideas.,
i was more interested than i was worried.,
if it ever actually happens i'll definitely post my experiences.,
hi just wondering if anyone knows if this is safe for me to use short term x or if anyone else is it thanks xx sent from the diabetes forum app hi they are meal replacement shakes x i will look into what's in them properly and decide my blood sugars have only just started being good after 5 years of trying to control them so don't want anything that can bring them up again thanks for replying x sent from the diabetes forum app,
"i wasn't sure where to post this, sorry if it's not in the right place.",
"anyway, i've been taking a high dose vitamin d3 capsule for a few months as i read that many diabetics can be deficient and it has many benefits.",
"yesterday, i came across some articles that suggested that taking a large dosage of vitamin d can cause calcium to be deposited in capillaries, the heart, kidneys, etc (i've posted a couple of the links below).",
"and that vitamin k must always be taken along with vitamin d, to avoid a build up of calcium, which will otherwise eventually lead to hypertension and heart attacks, etc.",
"http://articles.mercola.com/sites/artic ... and-k.aspx http://diabetesupdate.blogspot.com/2010 ... ouble.html i've stopped taking my vitamin d3 supplement for now, until i've done a bit more reading about this (vitamin d taken with vitamin k2 seems to actually prevent calcium deposists), and have worked out dosages of both vitamins, although i'm unsure now if i want to continue with the d3, and i'm also a bit nervous about the amount of dairy i eat (it's never a bad idea to cut down on this i suppose).",
"i was just wondering if the other people here who also supplement with large doses of d3 were aware of this link, and if you take k2 as well?",
"if you do, what sort of doses do you take?",
ta.,
"hi catherine, thanks for the reply.",
i personally am happy to take supplements if i find them beneficial and they haven't any detrimental side effects.,
"i regular take evening primrose oil and magnesium, and when i recently stopped these, along with my d3, coq10 and multivitamin (i had to stop these for a urine test), i found that the symptoms i take the epo and magnesium for returned.",
"however, i also found that some symptoms of another condition i have may have been aggrevated by the b vitamins in my miltivitamin.",
"so i think it's all swings and roundabouts, and it's really important to thorougly investigate any side effects and interactions that supplements may have.",
"after plenty of research, i'm happy to continue with the magnesium, epo and coenzyme q10 (which is particularly beneficial for my form of diabetes-midd), as i find these work for me and there is plenty of clinical evidence (for the coq10 at least), that these supplement are useful.",
"however, after more reading, i'm less happy to continue with the d3, b vits and i also recently cut out the vitamin c which has been linked to problems too.",
"as i said, i think it's very important to take the time to make sure that there won't be more problems possibly caused by taking the supplements than they may cure in the first place.",
":crazy: i suffer from s.a.d, and generally feel better in the summer months than during the winter, and suprisingly, tend to feel at my worst at this time of year.",
"i always thought that i should feel better in the spring as summer's on its way, but this seems to link in with vitamin d3 levels becoming depleted throughout the winter, and so being at their lowest around about feb/march.",
"i was taking high dose vitamin d3 (5000ui), until recently (i'd probably been taking it for around 6-7 months), but i can't say that i ever noticed any difference in my moods, energy levels, or general well being.",
"does this suggest that i might not be deficient, or does it take longer than 6 months for the benefits to kick in?",
"patch, have you considered taking some vitamin k along with your vitamin d3, just as a bit of added insurance against calcium deposits?",
"i wouldn't want to take my chances with this sort of thing as most of my family have had heart attacks/strokes, and the idea of spending part of my life paralysed terrifies me",
"hi, i'm needing advice again, well just went to pick up my prescription for my accu-chek strips and was told that our pharmacy cannot get them on nhs prescription.",
so the meter that i have just bought is no good.,
they can offer me testing strips for the accu-chek aviva or the accu-chek active!,
"which do you think is the best machine, have tried looking etc, and am still dumfounded as to which one to get, so any suggestions would be great.",
"looking forward to hearing your suggestions julie hi nigel & hobs, the one i bought was the accu-chek compact plus, which i've been getting on with ok, the dr wrote me the prescription, i went to pick it up today and the pharmacist said that there not available on nhs prescription, but he can get me aviva or active, the problem is my husband is in the army and i have to go through a military pharmacy, daft eh, mind i still have to pay, so i've just got a years pre payment certificate, seems like the best thing to do!",
"thanks for the advice julie hobs, your a star, was geting quite confused about it all, will get a nano one, looks good to me and been able to get the strips on prescription is a bonus, thanks for your help, where would i be without this board!",
thanks again julie,
quick question.,
i had my diabetic yesterday and the nurse said i had a weak pulse in feet.,
then nothing else!!!,
when i queried she just said oh its common!!!!,

"with the prospect of a sugar tax supported by jamie oliver (but refuted by david cameron), what do people think - should there be a sugar tax?",
it has been reported that hypo treatments would be exempt from a sugar tax.,
"labelling suggestions from jamie: if you think any choices are missing from the poll, please let us know and we'll update the poll squire fulwood said: i see a choice of a couple of options that might obtain in the future.",

2,
people who have learned what sugar does to them and have given up through choice.,

very valid point.,
zand said: i am only in favour of a sugar tax if the money raised from it is used to subsidise healthy foods.,

"avocado sevenfold said: in the context of a diabetes forum discussion, i don't care about the sugar content of foods.",
i care about carbs.,
the media's current obsession with sugar being the devil is just a red herring and i feel it is misleading.,

hi new to the forum and touchy subject so please be nice.....,
"recently, i had my first checkup with the consultant at my local diabetes clinic.",
during the appointment i was asked to take off my top and bra so that the doctor could perform a heart examination.,
so my question is....has everyone had to take their bra off for this examination?,
i tried to ask at my clinic if this was standard practice and was told that some doctors ask for bra off and others don't...??,
"this response has not made it clear to me if this examination was necessary, so i thought it would be great if i could hear from other female patients.... did you have to take your bra off??",
"i've already been treated like an 'attention seeker' or 'crazy' or a 'drama queen' for talking about this subject ( so if thats your planned chip in, ive heard it) in fact, i have found every part of the process (including writing this post) very scary and not enjoyable in the least, i also seem to have destroyed any chance of receiving fair and kind treatment from my hospital, so i find it hard to believe that anyone would ask these questions for a giggle....im not laughing!!!",
"catladynz said: it doesn't sound like standard procedure to me, and if it is, then doctors should change it.",
patients have rights and one of them is to have dignity... another one is to have questions/concerns taken seriously.,
whenever i've needed to remove my bra for an examination i've been allowed to do it behind a curtain and put a gown on.,
"the only time i didn't was when a female doctor performed a breast examination, and that situation is understandable.",
"if something like this happens again, you can say no and ask for a gown.",
"if they refuse to offer one, then stand your ground.",
your hospital should not change their treatment of you based on you expressing your view about things.,
"often hcps do, however.",
the system is slow to change.,
"in the 1950s, people did as they were told and questioning a hcp was not socially acceptable.",
"over the decades, there has been a movement for change, where patients rights have been enshrined in codes and policies.",
"in 2015, a hcp who treats a patient poorly runs the risk of consequences from their council (or whatever systems there are in each country).",
"in nz there is a health and disability commissioner who investigates anything from an hcp being rude, to preventable injury or death.",

i have also been told that the doctor in question is highly respected and that no other complaints have been made against him.,
all of which seems to pointing to me being called a liar.,
which is why i wanted to hear if others had been asked to remove their bras.,
all this questioning has made me question myself and at times i have wanted to cancel the complaint.,
"however, hearing that others were not asked to take off their bras has renewed my belief that this complaint is valid and important.",
"thanks again xx emma158 said: hi, what sort of examination did the doctor perform if you don't mind me asking?",
if he was simply listening to your chest i am unsure why he would request for you to remove your bra and it does seem unnecessary.,

last week my husband who is 86 and t2 was in hospital for 4 days with a heart problem and had a angiogram procedure to put some stents in his arteries since he has been home his blood glucose levels are sometimes in the 10's quite a bit higher than he normally has the food in there was not bad but portions were small and the salads he mostly had came with new potatoes which he did not eat all of so i did take some food in for him .breakfast he said was only porridge or cereals so he had porridge.,
he does have porridge at home sometimes and that does not usually put his levels up very much but he has not had that since he has been home but has been having eggs and bacon etc instead.,
i thought his levels would soon get back to normal at home as he is eating the meals we always do.,
has anyone here experienced this thanks for the good wishes and hopefully he will be alright now although he has to go back in a month for another angiogram on the other side to see if other arteries needs stents so not quite over yet but he is doing ok now still a bit weak but taking short walks when we take the dog out it was a shock and totally unexpected as he is always so well and active.,
he had some pain in his back the day before but by early next morning it suddenly got worse and very severe across the top of his back.,
i phoned my daughter at 7am luckily she lives in the same road and she was going to take him to a&e but when she saw how bad the pain was she phoned an ambulance.,
paramedics came quickly were really good did two ecg's and other checks then said they were taking him in as the ecg showed an irregular heart beat which they said may be angina.we were shocked as we never associated back pain as being due to the heart thought that was always chest pain which he didn't have but apparently not it can be the back as well i have told my husband what you all said that what he went through will affect his bg and make it higher for a while.,
i told him not to worry about it as now he is back to his normal routine and foods it will settle down again after a while,
ok i had a a glucose tolerance test at my doctors a few weeks ago the results were as follows.,
fasting 6.2 2 hour after glucose 10.4 although the day before test my kidney stones were hurting me so i didnt feel like eating and ate only some taost all day at about 3pm so fasted from 3pm instead of 10pm was told i have pre- diabeties or impaired glucose tolerance nothing to worry about however i decided to change my diet and and even bought a meter to keep an eye on my glucose levels.,
well the thing is i ate a bar of choclate the other night and had a can of coke as i just wanted to see what it did to my blood sugar levels it wentup to 10.8 after 2 hours and after fasting overnight it was 7.8 in the morning which is the range for being diagnosed daibetic.,
when i eat very healthy my fasting sugar level is about 6. so does this mean i might have diabeties or it just because i ate too much sugar any advice would be much appreciated as i odnt really want to back to doctor if i dont have to as i alreday made an appointment to ask him to explain pre-diabeties to me dont really want to bither him he might think im a hypercondriac or something lol.,
im just worried as father died from diabetis complications at only 54 and i have 4 sisters who are all diabetic including my twin sister.,
ps have been having sypmtoms of thirst frequent urnination and tiredness thats why i got tested in the first place thanks everyone for advice ill wiat another month and if things dont improve with a beter diet and excercise iol book another appointment with my doctor.,
"right, i had a fasting blood done at the docs a week or so ago and it came back with a 9.7 blood glucose, this means that i have an appointment with the practice diabetic nurse next week.",
"not being the kind of person to stand on ceremony, i've done a bunch of research, changed my diet, quit smoking, bought a blood glucose analyser...",
"so i measured last night, at 9:30 (3 hrs after my evening meal) - 5.9 measured again first thing this morning (07:30) -7.6 1 hr after breakfast (08:00) 6.4 (porridge) 2 hr after breakfast 6.7 12:00 hrs, just before lunch 5.7 (pasta and meatballs) 14:00 hrs - 6.4 now i was about to take a rennie as i have had acid for the first time in a week (thanks to the new diet) when i realised that i probably had at least 2 before i had the original blood test thats given me the diagnosis... questions: do these numbers look normal/diabetic (i know the 7.6 in the morning is high, but its not 9.7!)",
will rennie have that much of a pronounced effect?,
i note that it contains glucose among other sugars...?,
is it possible that though the diet change this week i have already bought it under control and thats why the numbers are what they are?,
or am i barking up totally the wrong tree?,
"any advice appreciated, because currently im very confused.",
iain thanks for the advice.,
basically im going to see what the nurse / docs says and get retested if necessary.,
im also sticking with testing until the appointment on monday.,
had a bit of a blow out last night and woke up to a 5.4 this morning (9 hrs fasting).,
"like a couple have said, its not the end of the world if i am, and i could really do with losing a few stone so whats the difference i've also felt a lot better week so thats another reason to stick at it.",
"thanks peeps, more soon... yep, it's definite.",
waiting for a ton of blood work to come back now from the d nurse.,
she's also mentioned metformin will hear more about that soon.,
"triglyceride's are off the chart at 7.7 so that's me on 40 mg simvarstatin (my dads is/was sky high as well) on the plus side, my liver and kidneys are absolutely fine and dandy.",
more as i get it / come to terms with it.,
"thanks for the numbers guys, had an hba1c done yesterday as well so will get the results of that friday.",
"that gives me a yardstick to work against with sorting the diet out, good news is that the nurse has prescribed strips and lancets so i can keep a close eye on what's going on.",
"doing a bit of reading i've seen some people mention that a good nights sleep can lower your waking bg level, any truth to this?",
"i'm not a good sleeper and never have been, there is always so much to do late at night that i rarely get over 6.5 hours and i also have an on call shift that i work 1 week in 3 that properly messes it up.",
"iain oh while i remember, can anyone recommend any good iphone / hp touchpad apps for tracking bg/food intake?",
well after testing for a week i can say that with the new diet im waking most mornings at 5.6 and rising after food to 6.4-7.6 depending what it is.,
levels return to normal 2-3 hours after eating.,
"still waiting on the hba1c results, apparently there is a backlog at the lab.",
"on the plus side, i've lost nearly a stone in 2 weeks thanks to dropping to <2000 cals a day.",
"hba1c is back, that's 6.8 and was taken about a week after diagnosis (ie the new regime will have had little effect on it).",
"marching on towards 1 1/2 stone lost, not bad for just under a month lets see how low i can get it on the retest in 2 months... yeah no medication at present, im hoping that i will see a large drop at next test as i have been following the diet advice quite religiously (had a couple of slips but nothing major) i've also quit milk as i noticed just how many sugars it has in it, will see what that does for the numbers over the next few weeks",
"hello, last night i was prescribed 15mg/500mg for my sciatica pain as the 8mg wasn't working, after taking my first dose last night i seemed fine but today, i feel hungry, and kind of weak.",
my blood glucose have been 6 all day so far so i know it isnt a hypo.,
could this be a side effect?,
"totsy said: hya nicola, i take 30/500 and it makes me very constipated and light headed so possibly but you have to weigh up the pros and cons, did it help the pain click to expand... hello!",
i dont think it has made me constipated well this is only my 2nd day of taking them it has eased the pain a bit not too much though so maybe i do need the 30/500 although on the packet it says codipar?,
is that just a brand name!?,
msmanicure said: was either of those listed on the sheet as possible side effects ??,
"i would give it a few days and see if this settles down, i take 30/500 and often feel like ive got a bit of a hangover for an hour or so after i wake up but nothing too bad and your body does tend tend to regulate itself.",
click to expand... erm i think so but i just expect it to be like this!,
maybe i am just worrying too much?,
giverny said: the weak feeling is pretty common with opiate pain killers.,
i was prescribed 60mg codeine phosphate (codeine is what's in co-codamol and codipar) a while ago.,
"not too sure about the hunger though, i find that codeine gives me stomach cramps click to expand...",
it like makes me very drowsy and weak and slightly lightheaded and kinda nauseous but im always nauseous kind of ha!,
"giverny said: yup, all common side effects of opiate painkillers.",
"you'll notice that after a few days these effects will be less obvious, and sometimes the pain relief can be less apparent too.",
"since you're taking a mix of codeine and paracetamol please, please don't take any extra to compensate!",
click to expand... oh damn!,
i just feel like my blood is constantly low even though it isnt!,
and no no i wont!,
i worry about things like that anyway!,
but thank you giverny said: if you're constantly running low it's probably best to speak to your diabetic nurse as soon as possible to see if your insulin doses need adjusting at all.,
"click to expand... no no my blood isnt low, it just feels like it is whilst i am on these tablets and when i test my blood its usually fine!",
goose64 said: certaily sounds like co-codamol - i take them occasionally to control arthritis pain & find some make me really woozy whilst other times they are fine click to expand... what dosage are you on?,
"sent from the diabetes forum app sid bonkers said: 15mg of is a relatively small dose for codeine which most people would have no bad reaction too, however it could just be that you are particularly sensitive to it.",
"i cant say ive ever had feelings of hunger or feelings of weakness/faintness or anything like that even on much larger doses but everyone is different, i have read on pain relief forums that occasional light headedness is quite common when starting opiate pain killers but should go away after a few days assuming you take them regularly.",
"the only noticeable side effect i have suffered with opiates has been constipation which can be coupled with stomach cramps, indigestion and/or nausea but that didnt happen until i was using much higher doses of codeine in the form of df118 40mg x 2 and the buprenorphine slow release patches that i now wear.",
i would say go back and explain your symptoms to your doctor and see what she/he thinks as it could be the pain relief meds or something totally unconnected.,
better to be safe than sorry click to expand...,
i think i will see how i go!,
its not constant light headedness just like a couple hours after ive taken them!,

every time i lay down the top of my legs feel like there are bugs crawling all over them.,

it's so strange as i don't have any problems with my feet or hands.,
is there anything i can do?,
i'm a t2d.,
"my bs are at 12 today, which is high but my normal is about 9.",
"hi, thanks for the replys .",
yes i am on metformin at the moment.,
2x500mg but my nurse wants to put me on something called trulicity as well.,
"thanks for all the replys and info, i have a lot of reading to do.",
is there a code for the low carb program it says it's 30 not free?,
billy.,
"yes i am on three different types of blood pressure tablets, i will speak to my gp about it.",
thanks.,
"it's no longer free, sorry.",
"yep, same site see time at top of screen shot",
"hello - i am 23, new here and have recently been diagnosed with type 1.",
"despite experiencing the classic symptoms i really did not see this coming and, as a very social person, i am nervous about how this will impact my social life.",
"in reading online about diabetes and alcohol, there is excellent advice on the effects/dangers/treatments associated with drinking.",
however can anyone recommend a particular alcoholic drink which they have found to keep a constant blood sugar level (particularly when going 'out out')?,
grateful for any advice before i start trialling...,
many thanks!,
i'm a 20 year old male and for the past 3 years i've always been worried about being a diabetic.,
"i've had symptoms like thirst, frequent urination, and feeling hungry very fast after eating a meal.",
"over the years 3 years i've never had a fasting glucose test, i once purchased a blood glucose monitor but i never performaned a fasting test with one.",
however when i did test my levels they were always in the normal range however i still always had symptoms.,
i have also used urine strips that test for glucose and they were all negative.,
"only fairly recently (couple of weeks) i've been thirsty, had a dry mouth and urinated lots lots more than usual.",
"i went to see the doctor today and he told me to take a fasting glucose test, i raised my concern with him telling him that i did not feel comfortable at all with taking one, because as it is right now even if i don't eat for 3-4 hours i start to feel like i'm shaking and get dizzy.",
"he wasn't bothered though but then again this is the only way to find out for sure, so i know it has to be done.",
can anyone give me tips on how to get through this without feeling like i'm going to slip into a hypo or something?,
that's what my main fear is.,
"i always eat right before i get into bed otherwise i will wake up in the night with gnawing hunger, i sleep for 7 hours so that means waking up and not eating for another 5 hours and i'm always hungrier in the mornings.",
"i just don't know how i'm going to do this, i know it isn't a big deal for anyone else but for me it just scares me thanks guys, i'm going to give it a go tomorrow, if i start to feel ****** though i'll have to call it off till next week.",
i hate having health anxiety because it makes simple things turn into big things.,
"to be honest i've pretty much applied a low g.i diet for the last 2 years or so purely because i convinced my self i was diabetic, my bodys used to getting food little and often and this is why i think when i don't eat for 3 hours i start to get low blood sugar symptoms.",
:/ cheers so even if i was diabetic and i went 12 hours without eating i'd be fine to do this test?,
i know it sounds silly but i just see my self flipping into a hypo.,
thanks for the reassurance folks.,
"just when tomorrow comes i know i'm going to wake up with gnawing hunger and it's gonna feel horrible, but it's gotta be done!",
hopefully it'll all be ok.,
cheers i woke up this morning feeling very hungry and i've still got another 3 hours to go before i can go for the test.,
"it feels like my blood sugar levels are really low, i don't know how long i'll be able to go until my body forces me to have something to eat.",
"i guess the anxiety just makes the symptoms worse for me, just feel woozy and it feels like i've got an inner tremor, and it feels like i just aren't fully awake at all.",
my stomachs burning.,
"not nice, still 3 hours to go.",
:/ if it is actually something like reactive hypoglycemia i have then i guess it wouldn't be safe to go this 12 hours?,
"can this fasting blood test have a definate mark between reactive hypoglycemia, normal and diabetes?",
cheers i just got back from the blood test - i was 15 minutes earlier than the full 12 hours but i don't think it matters much?,
"before i went to the hospital i tested my blood sugar levels on a spare meter my grandma has, the machine said my level was 5.0 which i think is pretty good?",
but i guess the tests will confirm.,
thanks for all the support guys greatly appreciated yeh massive relief that it's out of the way.,
hopefully i won't be needing another one anytime soon!,
i have an h1 ???,
test tomorrow can someone please tell me what this is as it wasn't really explained to me.,
thanks in advance ok but what do they do is it just a blood test ?,

etc is a problem for a diabetic??,
i love places like this ( especially on holiday) i dont think my body is reacting so well to them now.,
any thoughts ???,
very interesting..thanks for the replys..i had to stop going to the hydrotherrapy pool ( too hot) it really made me ill ( was going to help athritic hands) it was the one night in the week that i looked forward to.,
the normal pool doesnt affect me..the jacuzzi ( not hot) is fine but think i will have to avoid steam/sauna.,
"no..coz i do 5 mins in..then water then 5 mins sit, then 5 mins in again ( this is the only way i can do it) :?",
i was hoping that perhaps you could offer me some advice please.,
"i have recently been diagnosed with diabetes type two, albeit not a severe episode.",
i am trying to manage it through diet and have lost one and a half stone - from 16 and a half stone to fifteen with a view to hitting 14 and a half.,
i am a male and six feet tall.,
"i have also increased my cardio work, having always been an active rugby player and reduced my alcohol intake, which was not heavy anyway.",
"i am finding that when i do my own readings, there has been a slight drop and during the day and evening are within the normal range.",
"however, first thing in the morning, having not eaten all night, i sometimes wake with a reading of 140 or 8 and i spend the rest of the day trying to lower it.",
"i have heard of the dawn phenomenon and tried my readings at around 2.30 am and they are normal, i.e.",
below 110.,
the effect is in the morning i feel very lethargic and sluggish.,
my doctor is not familiar with this part of diabetes and i was wondering whether my morning reading is normal or nothing to concern myself about or whether there is something i could do to correct it.,
the previous days food intake does not seem to effect the reading; i have had a good diet and hit high in the morning and had a heavy drink session and hit normal.,
any help/advice would be very gratefully received so i can lose this awful morning feeling.,
thank you for your responses.,
"i get what you mean, i either have it or i don't.",
i have to get my head round the fact that i do!,
"i was really hoping i could control it by diet, but even after three months of hard work in that department and the weight loss/increased exercise it appears not likely.",
well to me anyway.,
"in answer to your question catherine, i have cut carbs right down; initially too far i think, but even now i eat within the required range.",
i eat significantly smaller amounts of everything and now have no need to snack between meals etc.,
"as a result my weight has dropped, but not my readings.",
i usually wake up with a reading of 120 to 140 - 140 being 8.,
"when it is that high i feel awful, like today.",
after a porridge breakfast it is usually 120.,
in all my times of reading i have only been under 110 being 6 twice before a meal although always i am way under 140 two hours after - normally 125 being 7.,
i mainly eat fish with plenty of veg.,
rice and pasta is minimal if ever and small amounts.,
potatoes too.,
i have noticed a link between drinking and a low reading the next morning.,
i feel better hung over than not!!,
thanks again and any advice etc would be very gratefully received.,
"i had another blood test today and await results, prob next week.",
"as much as i don't like taking pills, i am inlcined to ask for some.",
thanks again.,
i am currently in the caribbean but british.,
i will be back home in a month or so.,
thank you for that.,
that was very helpful.,
think i will try that.,
is it worth considering a protein shake late at night which will fit in nicely with my training?,
so i'm currently trialing the freestyle libre and soon after it was inserted it started to hurt.,
"whenever i moved my arm, it would ache, and sometimes i get a shooting pain in my arm.",
it's been over 24 hours since insertion and it still hurts and aches now and again.,
"i have very thin arms and i'm wondering if this is the problem, i'm wondering if it had hit a muscle or something?",
"the readings are absolutely perfect though, so i don't know.",
any ideas?,
"i'm hoping, like you said, that it will just go away soon, but it's still here and it can get quite painful at times...",
enough to make me swear out loud i feel like i've just got very unlucky or something,
"apologies if this is the wrong place to ask etc, but i have been booked in for a fasting blood glucose test on tuesday morning, and my gp has asked for hba1c to be tested too (i am not a diabetic yet, but my mother is a t1 for 32 and a half years and my grandmother , my mums mum, is a t2 for 20 years almost), due to me seeing blood glucose results of at the highest, 10.9mmol after a relatively healthy salad roll (relatively healthy being a cracked wheat roll, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, a slice of ham and some margarine).",
"the lowest my sugars have been lately, is 4.8.",
"my question is, what exactly will the hba1c show?",
"my gp has also asked for a fasting glucose test (not the glucose tolerance, just a bog standard water from midnight test), but from checking myself, my fasting sugars havent peaked much past 6.2mmol.",
"i am extremely worried about this, because if it does indeed show that i am diabetic, i dont know how this will react with my pernicious anaemia (accompanied with extremely low folates) or the nerve damage that has resulted from this already.",
hmm to google it is then.,
"i'd originally made the first appt with my gp on advice of the practice nurse, who i'd mentioned that i kept getting burning sensations in my hands and feet (my feet and lower legs are already affected by pernicious anaemia related neuropathy) and she insisted that i make an appt to get that checked out, which is when my gp ran the initial blood test primarily to check b12 levels, but she also checked stuff like folates (which were 1.3 and according to gp very low), liver function, blood glucose etc, which is when she discovered the borderline diabetes as the sugar came back as 6.2mmol.",
"after getting the blood results, i started randomly testing my sugar each day, sometimes 2 hours after a meal, and quite often before i'd eat, to see if there was some pattern of them going high.",
"the 10.9mmol result came roughly 2 hours after a meal, i checked the sugar level then because i'd started feeling unwell, and it was accompanied by the most god awful headache too.",
"when i saw my gp on the 13th of this month, i mentioned that 10.9mmol result to her, and she said that eating a salad roll really shouldnt have impacted my sugars to be that high as most normal people can cope with that, which is why she ordered a fasting test and an hba1c test.",
"she now also thinks that a lot of the symptoms ive had from the pa (the nerve issues, tiredness, headaches, urinary problems etc) could be related to the blood sugars, even though i was experiencing those 2 years ago when the blood sugars were coming back normal on labwork.",
hi everyone.,
"i've had type 1 for 18 years, and always had good control (often around 8 mmol/l) and always happy figuring out the dosage myself etc.",
this year i started using the freestyle libre and have now brought it down to 37% which looks like around 6.5 mmol/l.,
but i'm now aiming for a bit higher because i want to avoid hypos.,
"according to my libre, in the last 7 days 63% of the time i'm between 5 and 9 mmol/l, 29% above that, and 8% below.",
"i have long acting insulin at dinner, and novorapid with meals, but i also have novorapid when my blood sugar goes high.",
"he really did not like that, and firmly suggested i stick to that at mealtimes only and don't worry if my sugar level goes high in between, because it's only the people who always hit a bit high that suffer long term complications.",
one risk with topping up between meals is getting the fatty bits under the skin if i jab the same spot too often.,
"but i'm pretty good with changing needles and varying the spots, so while i can't avoid that issue, i can ideally help reduce the risk.",
"the other risk is having too many hypos, and eventually losing the ability to detect them.",
that scares me.,
"although technology is reaching the point where something will alert you when that happens anyways, i'd still rather not lose that ability.",
"from my point of view, i really hate the idea of seeing my blood sugar is high and not doing anything about it.",
"it makes me feel tired, and if it stays high during a night for example, my legs will get very stiff and uncomfortable (not a good sign to begin with i imagine).",
"sorry, my long winded question is that i wonder what everyone else does?",
"if you know your blood sugar has gone high, do you top up or wait for the next meal?",
(being careful with stacking of course).,
thanks for your thoughts!,
"thanks for the replies and the poll votes, very interesting to see that sounds like the way to take the extra doses, and the reason too.",
"i sometimes eat out and couldn't possibly carb count, but also even at home i eat such a wide variety of foods for dinner.",
"i'm using glargine, although if i increase that dose i start to get lows in the night.",
"i could switch to day and night insulin but then with a higher dose of that, i need more predictable meal times than i have.",
for lunch today i ate a bit too much at work and it went up to 17 mmol/l and was still going up.,
"i was certainly trying to give 3 doses a day a go, but just couldn't when it was like that.",
i quickly corrected it and all was well again.,
"when i get between highs, they're usually because i didn't give myself enough novorapid, or i just had a snack.",
"especially with having a 5 hour gap between breakfast and lunch usually, i get hungry i don't want to just discard my doctors advice, because he's a damn good doctor, the best i've ever had and he immediately knew what was wrong at times when other doctors couldn't figure it out.",
"so i'll certainly give this a solid try, but i just cannot picture it working out.",
"in a perfect world where someone eats the same meals (or can carb count everything) at roughly the same time and has the same physical activity, stress etc, i imagine it does work.",
but in the real world i don't want to choose between being hungry and having high blood sugar.,
"but i certainly do agree, without a doubt, that i want to avoid hypos as much as possible.",
"maybe an insulin pump is the way to go for me too, although it's really expensive here and the libre is quite expensive already.",
"just aside from that, i have to admit i truly love the freestyle libre system.",
"back in the very early 2000's i was one of the first people to trial the dexcom cgm, back when they had to surgically implant a jellybean sized sensor into me.",
"so i knew this technology was coming, but it's amazing to have it here now.",
"sugar surfing looks very interesting, i'll have to give that a read for sure.",
rokaab that's interesting the novorapid takes longer to kick in than other times.,
i don't suppose it's when it's injected to similar areas that it's slower to take effect?,
agreed if it's close to the next meal i'd just wait too.,
fiasp?,
"hopefully that goes well, it's not something we have in new zealand yet but if it works well i hope we do get it soon.",
"engineer88, that's what the doctor said to do yes, 4 injections a day (3 novorapid; breakfast, lunch, dinner) and one glargine (dinner).",
"but in reality i'd say it's not unusual that i have 2 or 3 more a day of novorapid, when i have a snack in mid-morning / mid-afternoon or evening.",
"mostly it's the evening, because i want to get it as right as possible before sleep.",
"if i wake up from high blood sugar in the night, i'll correct then, but that's rare thanks to my small evening dose.",
it's rare i go low during the night too thankfully.,
"the novorapid reaction time, that's a good question.",
"i do inject before eating (usually only a few minutes before), unless it's around 5 or so, then i want until after (otherwise i find it just goes low).",
"if my blood sugar is like 9 or so, i'll inject earlier before eating.",
"overall i'd say my blood sugar rises in the first hour, then goes down.",
"dixon1995, completely agree, if mine is between 4 and 7 that's where i want it to be too, so i happily leave it.",
but above 8 or 9 sounds like it needs a top up.,
"that's where the libre comes in handy, because i can see if it's 8 or 9 and going up fast (whereas without the libre it might be 8 or 9 going up or down, i won't know).",
good idea regarding the nights.,
and that's good to know it's not unusual to have 2 or 3 more a day of novorapid.,
"when i got back home from the doctors actually i happened to have an appointment letter for our diabetes center, so it'll be interesting to get their thoughts also.",
"keytones, yeah i vaguely remember about those when i was first diagnosed, but haven't had any tests since.",
i'll check on that.,
"when they go higher than 14 though, i really try to get them down quickly (and safely) because they seem to effect me quite quickly.",
"like before when it was 11, i already had quite a dry mouth (and i drink probably 2 litres of water a day on average) and i can feel it in my legs.",
"hi everyone.....my husband had a bad fall a month ago, and blacked out...ambulance called as it was feared he had broken his back...fortunately he hadn't..just cracked ribs.",
"he had a thorough examination by the paramedics, and all was normal (ecg, oxygen levels, bp) however his blood sugar was 8.5, which i thought was slightly high, given he had had nothing to eat for several hours.",
"he has recovered from his injuries, but about a week ago developed a raging thirst, tiredness and general feeling of being unwell.",
i suggested i did his bs (i am type 2) but he refused.,
"however, today i insisted on doing it and got a reading of 20.5.",
just wondering if this could be connected to his accident?,
"he is refusing to visit the gp, saying he will try and control it himself.....i just don't know what to do.",
any advice would be welcome.,
thank you.,
carbsrok said: i have heard before that shock can cause type 1 diabetes.,
as your husbands numbers have risen so high and quickly imho he needs an urgent trip to see a dr as he could well have developed type 1 diabetes.,

"thank you, but getting him to the gp is another matter.",
"sarahkylie88 said: i have heard it can be trauma or illness, i had a bad viral infection... 6 weeks after-type one diabetic.",
same happened to a girl i know.,
someone else became diabetic not long after a traumatic event.,
"apparently it is already there, these events just trigger it!",
hope u manage to get him to get checked out x xx click to expand...,
thank you everyone for your very helpful replies...i will nag him about a gp appointment.,
just an update on my husband.,
"he has refused to visit his gp, and has attempted to lower his bs himself, which he did, the lowest reading being 12.5 (still too high, i know).",
"however, when he came home from work tonight, i insisted i tested him (hadn't done it for a few weeks).....he was very reluctant, but i'm afraid i lost my rag somewhat and told him a few home truths of what could happen if this problem was ignored.",
"long story short, i won, tested and it was 30.4 !!!!",
"i tried to remain calm, and asked him what he had eaten today....you wouldn't believe what he'd had!",
"chips, corned beef pie, peas.....coffee, biscuits, grapes...you name it, he ate it!",
"i had a long talk with him, and finally got him to change his gp to mine, which is local.",
he will probably need to go to the surgery at some point to sign forms or whatever.,
i intend to phone the surgery tomorrow to find out the procedure and also tell the receptionist the full story and see if they can offer any advice on how to get him seen.,
"other than this, i am at a loss as to what to do next.",
"sorry for the rant, and thank you for all the input so far.",
i agree.,
"but short of physically dragging him out of the house, i just don't know what else i can do.",
"he says he feels fine, and that is one of the reasons he ate what he did today, thinking because he felt well, his bs was down.",
i tried to send this questions a few minutes ago but something seemed to go wrong so i am trying again - hope i am not duplicating the question.,
"as far as i know i am not diabetic but i have noticed recently that when i eat sweet things i suddenly become overwhelmingly tired, feel my enrgy draining away completely and feel generally unwell.",
does this happen when a person with diabetes eats sweet things?,
thanks to everyone who replied.,
i have an appointment with my gp in two weeks' time.,
best wishes to everyone and good luck for the future.,

"i've been diabetic now for 20 years,insulin controlled.my sugar levels are never stable it's uncontrollable.i've been running very high for weeks now then i panic shoot insulin and end up low then eat the food cupboard lol.what concerns me is at times,not neccessarily when my sugars are at extremes my speech gets slurred and my wife accussed me of drinking or taking drugs or something.i don't do either and really would like know what causes this slurred speech.thanks i've been to doc got tested i'm on blood pressure mess but all else fine.my mouth gets very dry when bloods unstable.does anyone else experience this?",
no i've not tested for ketones in about a year.,
that's great thanks it all makes sense.no haven't got thrush but the rest fits,

tested before food 17 tested at midnight 18.2 .... gave myself a 20 unit correction!!!!!!,
"plus 20 lantus woke up to 17.6 at 10am had 2xbrown bread, 1/2 can heinz beans.",
tested at 12 and i'm 18.6 so gave myself another 30 units to correct !!!,
"this is so out of control, i have given myself 70 units of lantus in 12 hours for beans on toast.",
the doctors on my review just say i need to work harder at it for the last 3 years... i have now refused to go because they are not helping at all.,
and just make me feel rubbish.,
is someone ele experienced what is happening to me?,
i am pretty much in tears daily cause i'm trying so hard and completely failing.,
please help me ;-( please lee thanks everyone fro replying...,
"i had a curry last night as its ""friday night take out"" night... its my treat night once a week, ive been on a diet for as long as i can remember.",
we only buy brown instead of white.,
"i used to have 3 sugars in tea until ""that"" day happened and changed to 1 spleda in my tea.",
"i usually have special k for brekkie (again i know its carbs) i drink coke zero, or diet drinks, never ever full fat drinks.",
or sugar free cordial juice.,
"my portions are pretty small, and can hardly ever finish a full plate even when trying.",
i pretty much live on weight watchers meals (people in the uk will know what i mean) daily for lunch.,
and a veg dinner for tea.,
"its horrible when you live on rabbit food and small portions and for what... not to lose a single pound/oz and to never ""feel"" healthy.",
"i have asked my doc to change insulin but he said he can't authorise that and a specialist needs to ""ok"" it... he said he will write a letter to ""sell oak diabetic clinic"" for me to only see their top dog... and when i got there, again i was booked into see a registrar/intern.",
"who told me my sugars are to high and i'm not trying hard enough, and to see the dietician.",
which i do and they say the diet i'm telling them shouldn't be how it is behaving.,
"and basically calling me a liar, and that then starts all over again on my next review.",
"this has been my diabetic experience and has been awful, i feel the care provided has been very 'supermarket checkout' next please!!",
regarding my diabetic level... they said i was a diabetic 1 (after a whole year) and never said anything else... they gave me metformin to help with weight loss which what i believe is also given to type 2s.,
i will take the advice of all the posts and stop eating bread for one.,
zero carb is pretty difficult as i did the atkins yarrs ago and found it hard living off meat.,
anyway tested at 3pm and was 11 had spag bol... very little pasta... and will test again in two hours.,
also i have been in hospital a few times with operations and every time nurses comment saying its taking ages for my sugar levels to come down.,
and these are professionals.,
so i think my body is really struggling using the injected insulin.,
"this is so out of control, i have given myself 70 units of lantus in 12 hours for beans on toast ](do you mean lantus here or novo?, your basal insulin is not meant to cover meals) i meant nova rapid - sorry was getting worked up towards the end of my rant.",
"i take 20/20 split because i did the dafne course and was originally on 50 before bed and they changed it, but by the end of the course i felt the others were looked into and i was 'over looked' when they were trying to work out ratios etc... my ratios seem to be 4 or 5 :1 at least in most cases.",
i have reverted back to pretty much 20 units of nova for every meal and then also 20 corrections.,
in dafne they bought us that to correct you only ever give 1 unit for 2mm over.,
so for 18 id need to correct 6 units... this never has fixed the issue from the day they told me to do this.,
"i tried it, and told them it didn't work but they didn't advise anything else.",
so i doubled... trebled... for the breakfast this morning i gave 20 units.,
usually i will have 1x metric cup of special k and 1x metric cup of s.s.milk ... 1 cup of tea (1 splenda) and give 20units.,
this seems excessive to me but my sugars climb.,
"im not the most active person in the world, i fix computers so spend a lot of time sitting.",
i take kids swimming once a week for an hour or two but thats really it.,
(*ashamed*) but thats being truthful or i won't get this fixed.,
"i have done fasting readings in the past, and throughout the night readings.",
and they always seem to climb.,
it just seems that i should keep increasing lantus to over 80 units a night (which it has been before) which in turn adds massive weight gain.,
for example..,
i can fast til i am 7.0 and steady... eat an exact measured carbs for e.g.,
50g.,
"i can give my self 20 units, test two hours later and be up at 17... can nova rapid not work for some people?",
"hi guys , i'm off on honeymoon next sunday and just wanted some pump users advice this will be my first holiday with a pump on and i like to spend the day in the pool i know the pump sets don't stay on for long in the water any advice to keep it on for longer?",
or do people go back to injecting in the day so can be swimming as much as they want to ?,
"and advice would be great thank you x hi becs, thank you i know we are going to a water park so will probably do the same.",
i thought i would wear the pump every evening and morning until i get in the pool then will have a pen with me to inject inbetween x,
i have to thank yorksman for this idea of the subject.,
"basically, i have just been diagnosed and started off on 1 metformin 500mg a day for week 1, then 2 a day for week 2 then week 3 onwards, 3 a day.",
"i have noticed if i dont have food at the usual time, or start to feel hungry, i get a bit shaky and sometimes blurry vision.",
"i never got this bad before diagnosis, so is this the first sign of a hypo, or is a side effect of the medication?",
"if its a side effect, well, i dread the 3 pills a day.",
i dont test my blood as i havent seen a nurse yet.,
not been given any monitors or even told to test by my doctor.,
just told to ask all my questions to the nurse.,
"aaahhh, right, you may have answered another question there, are the test strips and lances (if i need to test) available on prescription?",
"and as for stomach upsets and gas-well combine them with my hiatus hernia/reflux and kidney stone, i can see some time off work ahead of me.",
"i've been on one metformin for a week today, after reading about side effects on here i asked for, and got, the sr version in the hope that i might not suffer with any.",
"well, for the last 3 days i've had gut ache, flatulence (i'm female.....it's embarrassing!!!",
".....we 'ladies' aren't supposed to do that :wink: ), stomach gurgling like a volcano about to erupt, the runs.....",
"i'll put up with it all, if i have to, as long as i know it will all go away soon....... :shock: i'm not keen on increasing the dose with these side effects on just one tab, although my dsn did say to drop down again if i get the side effects and can't cope on an increased dose.",
so how long will they last?,
"give me some hope that it's not for much longer, please!",
":crazy: that's the thing though - i eat hardly any starchy carbs now, haven't done for a couple of months.",
"having said that, husband cooked sunday lunch yesterday and served up mashed carrot and swede, roast potatoes and peas along with the pork - oh, and a bit of cabbage too.",
"the cabbage is normally the only veg i would eat out of that lot.....bless him, he doesn't quite 'get' this carb thing yet.",
"i was up in the night with worse stomach cramps/diarrhoea ( sorry, too much info, i know), so it looks as though the carby veg did exacerbate everything.",
"of course, he didn't stand over me forcing me to eat it all.....but he made the effort to cook, so i had to eat it, didn't i?",
":wink: i'm sure it will all get better with time - well, i blooming hope so!",
":shock: thanks for the help, everyone.",

having the metformin helps with the resistance so i don't end up injecting more and more insulin.,

(which isn't alot) but have found i have less insulin over all.,
that's what the consultant says anyway.,

teenagers and ?,
"early 20 year olds can experience growth spurts where growth hormones increase at times, causing increased insulin resistance.",
"certainly that happened to me, but the growth spurt was followed by a time of 'normality"", hypos would occur and i had to quickly scale back the insulin doses.",
"alternatively, maybe there is another explanation or two for your increased insulin resistance.",
some people have commented that metformin taken with a meal tends to cause less tummy upset.,
others have been prescribed a long-acting version of metformin and find this causes less tummy upset.,
i hope things settle down for you soon.,
best wishes.,

thanks for your reply to my question.,
i do have a meter and will test as you have suggested!,
daisy1 said: @steph81170 hello steph and welcome to the forum here is the basic information we give to new members and i hope you will find it useful.,
ask more questions when you want and someone will be able to help.,
basic information for new members diabetes is the general term to describe people who have blood that is sweeter than normal.,
a number of different types of diabetes exist.,
a diagnosis of diabetes tends to be a big shock for most of us.,
"its far from the end of the world though and on this forum you'll find well over 235,000 people who are demonstrating this.",
"on the forum we have found that with the number of new people being diagnosed with diabetes each day, sometimes the nhs is not being able to give all the advice it would perhaps like to deliver - particularly with regards to people with type 2 diabetes.",
the role of carbohydrate carbohydrates are a factor in diabetes because they ultimately break down into sugar (glucose) within our blood.,
"we then need enough insulin to either convert the blood sugar into energy for our body, or to store the blood sugar as body fat.",
"if the amount of carbohydrate we take in is more than our bodys own (or injected) insulin can cope with, then our blood sugar will rise.",
"the bad news research indicates that raised blood sugar levels over a period of years can lead to organ damage, commonly referred to as diabetic complications .",
the good news people on the forum here have shown that there is plenty of opportunity to keep blood sugar levels from going too high.,
its a daily task but its within our reach and its well worth the effort.,
"controlling your carbs the info below is primarily aimed at people with type 2 diabetes, however, it may also be of benefit for other types of diabetes as well.",
there are two approaches to controlling your carbs: reduce your carbohydrate intake choose better carbohydrates reduce your carbohydrates a large number of people on this forum have chosen to reduce the amount of carbohydrates they eat as they have found this to be an effective way of improving (lowering) their blood sugar levels.,
"the carbohydrates which tend to have the most pronounced effect on blood sugar levels tend to be starchy carbohydrates such as rice, pasta, bread, potatoes and similar root vegetables, flour based products (pastry, cakes, biscuits, battered food etc) and certain fruits.",
choosing better carbohydrates the low glycaemic index diet is often favoured by healthcare professionals but some people with diabetes find that low gi does not help their blood sugar enough and may wish to cut out these foods altogether.,
read more on carbohydrates and diabetes .,
"over 145,000 people have taken part in the low carb program - a free 10 week structured education course that is helping people lose weight and reduce medication dependency by explaining the science behind carbs, insulin and gi.",
eating what works for you different people respond differently to different types of food.,
what works for one person may not work so well for another.,
the best way to see which foods are working for you is to test your blood sugar with a glucose meter.,
to be able to see what effect a particular type of food or meal has on your blood sugar is to do a test before the meal and then test after the meal.,
a test 2 hours after the meal gives a good idea of how your body has reacted to the meal.,
"the blood sugar ranges recommended by nice are as follows: blood glucose ranges for type 2 diabetes before meals: 4 to 7 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 8.5 mmol/l blood glucose ranges for type 1 diabetes (adults) before meals: 4 to 7 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 9 mmol/l blood glucose ranges for type 1 diabetes (children) before meals: 4 to 8 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 10 mmol/l however, those that are able to, may wish to keep blood sugar levels below the nice after meal targets.",
"access to blood glucose test strips the nice guidelines suggest that people newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes should be offered: structured education to every person and/or their carer at and around the time of diagnosis, with annual reinforcement and review self-monitoring of plasma glucose to a person newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes only as an integral part of his or her self-management education therefore both structured education and self-monitoring of blood glucose should be offered to people with type 2 diabetes.",

halo can anyone advise what is considered the healthy fasting insuline level in blood for a non diabetic.,
"i ask because i am a type 2, and i understand that type 2's usually have elevated levels; such levels being linked with increased risk of complications.",
thank you regards pavlos earlier today i gave blood to have l lipid panel done and i asked for my fasting glucose and insulin levels to be analysed as well.,
i am waiting for the results.,
regards pavlos got my results.,
"fasting glucose 4.56 mmol/l (normal range 3.3 - 6.1) insulin 6.03 mlu/l (normal range 2.6 - 24.9) insulin resistance test 13.6 (<4 high resistance, 4.1 - 17.0 normal, 17.0 low resistance) don't know much about the insulin and insulin resistance tests but based on the results and normal ranges given by the lab report, it looks like the metformin is doing its job.",

"hi, i had a small bowl of kellogg's just right cereal for breakfast.",
then a couple of hours later a bacon sarnie on wholemeal with tomato sauce.,
now this i think is where i went wrong.,
i had 2 christmas mince pies with cup if tea no sugar.,
few hours later feeling very thirsty so tested & it was 8.9.,
is this very high or not too bad?,
i'm trying to drink water to bring it down a bit.,
"i last ate about 5hrs ago & know i really should be cooking the family's tea, but i really & truly don't feel in the least hungry or have any appetite.",
was i wrong to have the mince pies?,
i know 2 is greedy but i couldn't resist.,
"i have dreadful calf pain when i walk, and no amount of pain killers help.",
i have seen my gp until i am blue in the face.,
"i had a doppler, it came back normal.",
"the pain starts when walking, when i am sitting there is nothing at all.",
my calf muscles turn to concrete and i could scream with the pain.,
"this all started around 5 years ago, around the time i believe i actually became diabetic.",
"i take quinine for night time cramp, but nothing during the day.",
any ideas?,
robert72 said: hi defren it sounds a bit like intermittent claudication.,
does the pain stop when you stand still and start a short time after you start to walk?,
click to expand...,
if i stop and sit down it goes almost straight away.,
i can rest for 5 seconds or five hours and it will come back as soon as i start to walk.,
i have bought a treadmill to see if walking a lot but in small amounts will help.,
i got a motorised one as that is easier than a manual one.,
"it hurts like hell, but i will keep trying.",
what is intermittent claudication?,
"[edit to add] i have just read up on this, and it sounds exactly what i have.",
thank you.,
i will speak with my gp now i have an idea of what is going on.,

thanks for your help.,
robert72 said: hi defren this is something i had checked last year.,
they booked me in for an ultrasound from my belly and down both legs (that jelly stuff is weird ) the initial treatment is to take a 75mg aspirin and a statin and walk for about 30 minutes a day to try and increase the blood flow through surrounding routes.,
i can walk 3 times as far now as i could last year before it gets too painful so hopefully it will improve over time.,
obviously taking control of diabetes is a big factor too.,

"the manufacturer claims it's gastro resistant, but can you be sure it is?",
"if avoiding the risk was that easy, all nsaids would be delivered that way.",
a coating on the tablet means nothing - our bodies are far more complex than that.,
"we have a significant chronic illness, diabetes, and so it's wise to seek medical advice before starting a new drug, even when it's available without a prescription.",
"for example, it's legal to buy enough paracetamol at a supermarket that would kill you within 48 hours if you took it all at once.",
another thing to keep in mind is - do you want the baseline diagnostic testing to show the problem is less severe because you started treating it before testing?,
"by all means, take control of your own health - i'm the first to say doctors can't always be trusted (see my post about testing).",
just a few things to keep in mind.,
everything in moderation.,

"diabetes.co.uk meeting/event date - saturday 1st september (exact times to be confirmed) place birmingham (venue to be announced in the next few days) i'm currently working on putting together a low carb high fat to control blood sugars, regain your health, avoid complications, and perhaps reverse your diabetes event.",
"it's open to anyone especially those interested in learning more about diabetes, controlling blood sugars and about the lchf way of eating .",
i havent organised such an event before so it is a bit of a learning curve.,
"massive thanks to those who are helping any which way, really could not do it without you .",
an amazing team effort .,
any ideas much appreciated no matter how big or small .,
it is coming together quite quickly from just having the idea about 2 weeks ago to having a date set in stone (saturday 1st september).,
it is a date that works well for the diabetes.co.uk team so that they can get all the relevant people there.,
they are inviting low carbers themselves so thats great.,
the more the merrier.,
it's not too far away so it's full steam ahead for planning.,
"lots of us chat and learn so much from the forum and read the inspirational stories, but i thought it would be really nice for as many of us as possible to have an actual get together.",
i have had lots of feedback from people who would like to attend which is absolutely amazing.,
exciting times.,
"diabetes.co.uk are supporting us massively by sorting a venue, providing food and generally helping with putting the event together .",
"it's a wonderful opportunity for us to meet fellow members face to face, for veterans and experienced members to share their heaps of knowledge and for newcomers to perhaps learn more about their condition and how to deal with it to avoid future complications.",
"peoples' journeys will be there for you to read, weight loss successes , information on how to reduce hba1c levels to control blood sugars and enjoy life without complications , info on different ways to incorporate fasting into your journey should you so wish to and the different methods of doing that, ways to incorporate exercise , from armchair to high impact.",
info on cholestrol .,
we are hoping to have a section of people's recipes including breakfast ideas and cakes if you don't mind sharing these i am gathering your own personal recipes (not from a book or online blogger) .,
"each recipe needs to have a title, for example 'looks horrendous but tastes divine' or 'my ultimate dessert'.",
there will be low carb food and drink information and much much more.,
lunch will be provided (low carb of course) please let me know as soon as possible if you can attend .,
if you need any help in planning journeys please let me know as i might be able to help.,
there will be a before and after photos section i need lots of before and after photos folks!!!,
and i'm looking for anyone who has lost weight with the lchf woe to please contact me if they don't mind me using their photos at the event.,
i also need their weight loss details and hba1c before and after.,
i have some kind volunteers already by many more needed.,
we would like to reach the '100 stone lost the lchf way and reversed our diabetes' mark.,
would make a fantastic headline.,
it's just great to see and share the motivational results too.,
the diabetes.co.uk photographer and pr team will be there to take a photo of our success (but you only need to get in front of the camera shot should you so wish and if you do.... bring your old big clothes !!!).,
"we thought of having as many people as possible in the one photo maximum impact showing how the lchf has helped us lose weight and our hba1c levels, control our blood sugars and enjoy life without complications.",
we are the people with this condition and as ambassadors there is no better way of getting the message out.,
showing people there is another way that might not have to involve medication.,
that might mean the disease does not need to be progressive as we are led to believe.,
a healthier way of dealing with it.,
it's a great opportunity to show the world how eating lchf can reverse/put into remission/control this beast and help us regain good health.,
this will hopefully be the first of many meetings between us and we can go from strength to strength as a group with the help and support from diabetes.co.uk without which it would not be possible.,
"please contact me for further information, if you have any questions/ideas or to confirm whether or not you might be able to attend.",
many thanks.,
@rhubarb73 your comments are so encouraging.,
thank you.,
i hope it's successful and will be the first of many.,
see you at the next one (thinking positive!).,
i think dm recipes.,
@shelley262 is recipe monitor we will work it between us.,
we can include weight loss for anyone who can't attend so 2 stone is a fantastic achievement and i'm thrilled to add it towards our target of 100 stone.,
you love lchf woe then?,
great isn't it.,
your hba1c reflects well.,
i'm not sure how to market yet.,
i think i will see what response i get on here first and take it from there.,

hi there can someone please tell me what cereal i can eat.,
"i live in the london borough of barnet, and i have to say that as a council, they are useless at diabetes care.",
"i've just joined the forum, but have read quite a lot of the posts about low carbs and how bringing blood sugar levels down to 'normal' range can help with complications such as neuropathy.",
"i've not been diagnosed as prediabetes, but my hba1c is 39 (5.7%).",
apparently in the usa this is just into the prediabetes range although not by the uk definition.,
i am having trouble with my feet/legs (neurologist says 'slight neuropathy').,
"rather than wait for things to get worse, i've started to adjust my diet.",
about 3 weeks ago i reduced carbs to about 75g - 100g per day.,
"however, its not nearly as low as recommended in dr bernstein's book 'the diabetes solution'.",
1) if i can get my blood sugar down to normal on a 75g-100g carbs diet will that be likely to help symptoms of neuropathy or do i need to go much lower carbs ?,
2) is there any scientific research/evidence that you need to be in ketosis in order to help symptoms ?,
thank you so much for your swift reply.,
it makes a lot of sense.,
so the key is the blood sugar level rather than ketosis.,
i have been testing my blood sugar for the last 2 weeks.,
its a great incentive to think what you are about to put in your mouth when you know you will be taking a reading in an hour or so !,
my fasting readings have been between 5.2 and 6.4.,
mostly after meals they don't go above 7.0 but have had a couple up to 10 (big bowl of porridge).,
i'm aiming to get rid of anything above 6.5 and keep mostly below 5.5.,
think i'll persevere at about 75g-100g for another couple of weeks fine tuning then adjust if necessary.,
totto said: you need to find out why you have neuropathy.,
if it's not caused by high blood sugar i doubt if lowering blood sugar will help.,
"there are lots of things that can cause neuropathy, apart from diabetes, lack of b12 one of the more common.",
have you seen a neurologist?,
click to expand...,
yes i've seen gp (prescribed vit d due to deficiency) and then neurologist (said mild neuropathy... carry on with vit d and also agreed with my taking b12 which was on low side but within normal range ).,
also sent for orthotics (shoe insoles).,
my plan is to see if diet adjustment helps over next few months and if not go back to gp/neurologist.,
"k azure said: @begonia heres the thread: http://www.diabetes.co.uk/forum/threads/help-in-dealing-with-neuropathy.74653/ as you can see there, the key is keeping blood sugar below certain levels.",
"certain supplements are also recommended, but do check with your doctor first.",
click to expand...,
"thanks for taking the time to find this thread for me, i'll take a look.",
i have been one round with the gp and neurologist but no definitive cause for symptoms found as yet.,
neurologist basically said too early to send me for mri.. see how you get on with supplements and orthotics (shoe insoles).,
if no improvement in a few months i'll go back to neurologist.,
"juicetin said: hi begonia, i am on the lower end of prediabetic and i have suffered neuropathy in my feet for around 12 months.",
"it is in the form of a strange pressing sensation on the balls of both feet which is very uncomfortable, particularly at the end of a long day.",
i have also had tingling and electric shock like sensations but these have mostly subsided.,
"i have seen several specialists, a highly commended podiatrist and a neurologist who have all conducted tests including nerve conduction studies.",
"the long nerves are unaffected so in the absence of any other evident underlying causes i have been diagnosed with small fibre neuropathy which is ""likely"" caused by having higher than normal blood sugar for a long period of time.",
"i say ""likely"" because there is no definitive way of proving it, neuropathy can be caused by many things, but in my case high blood sugar is seen as the likely culprit as i am otherwise a very fit 45 year old bloke. """,
"just unlucky"" are the words the neurologist used to describe me.",
i have seen a slight improvement in the condition by taking alpha lipoic acid and vitamin b1 and b12 supplements.,
"i am not a super low-carber, i am probably on around 80-100g a day, but i did go through a prolonged spell of under 50g a day and this made no difference to the neuropathy.",
"it has been a life-changer for me, i have had to give up hill walking and a number of sports already.",
"in answer to your specific questions - there is no guarantee that reducing your carbs to very low levels will cure neuropathy, but it may steady and delay it's progression.",
"similarly, there is no guarantee that keeping good control of your bs will cure it, but it is undoubtedly the single best thing you can do.",
"click to expand... hi juicetin, thanks for your post.",
sorry to hear that you have had to give up some of your sports.,
sounds like a low carb diet is helpful to you but that going to very low carbs was no better... is that correct ?,
i have read up the work on alpha lipoic acid done mainly in germany.,
it looks like the most promising along with benfotiamine and b12.,
i have had feet/leg symptoms for about 9 months.,
"started with cold feet and then progressed to pain when walking, mainly from the heels.",
"i have a very active job, working in a plant nursery where i am on my feet for several hours a day.",
symptoms are much worse during and after long day standing.,
previously i could be on my feet as long as i wanted.,
i'll see how things go with low carb diet and supplements for a couple of months then back to neurologist if no improvement.,

"dear panel, since having my son four years ago i have been experiencing what i can only describe as a tiny blue square of light in my vision when my blood sugars either drop or are on the rebound.",
"i had pre-eclampsia and saw ""stars"" when i was in hospital but this is just one pin-prick of a blue light and is definately square!",
"i have asked my diabetic nurse, consultant, optician and retinopathy scanner and so far none of them have a clue.",
i'm sure there is a simple answer but as with all complications of diabetes i would like it answered and dealt with as soon as possible.,
can anyone help me?,
thank you everyone for your support and quick replies.,
i will ask again when i see my team.,
it is a strange one isn't it!,
it's a job to know what to think with this disease.,
my overall readings were 7.1 but have been a little higher in the past.,
i do tend to stay around 4-8 but do a lot of exercise and can crash at any time with a hyper rebound.,
"i have had type 1 since i was ten, that's 23 years of it!",
"i take moderate amounts of humalog (lispro) 3 x a day and levemir 2x a day and was put on to metformin slow release (3 x a day) after my son was born, so it may be the metformin that's doing it, i didn't put two and two together until you said.",
"i will definately be noting down the times, the only thing is that i haven't seen a ""diabetic doctor"" for about four years due to cut backs in my area.",
the nurses at the hospital are brilliant but may not have the extra detailed knowledge to help me.,
as usual the internet is providing me with valuable self help to arm myself with!,
i will tell you what it is when i find out.,
i do hope it's not an impending stroke as my dad died suddenly of one when i was 16 but i will do my blood pressure too when it happens again.,
thanks again!,
"julia xx dear all, i can't thank you enough.",
i am seeing a specialist next week and will be telling her about it.,
is the metformin harmful with insulin?,
i would like to know your findings.,
"i was changed from actrapid and monotard in my childhood and teens to actrapid and insulatard in my twenties, then to lispro and insulatard whilst pregnant, then lispro and lantus after he was born (lantus was awful for me) then to lispro and levemir and metformin soon after i saw the ""one"" diabetic doctor!",
it's a job to know what to think and if these drugs companies slip a back hander to the doctors to test on people!,
my symptoms are very similar to those described with the dark blobs though mine are quite small but i found out in early december that i have background retinopathy so the dark blob might be that even though it is when i'm low.,
i did have a look on the internet for blue lights and found one article about white blood cells in the vision but nothing more.,
i did take my blood pressure and readings when it happened and they were 6.9 and 122/72 and pulse of 75.,
i will update when i've seen the specialist.,
"thanks to all for the valuable information you've taken the time to send me, it is much appreciated as diabetes can be a very lonely disease when things go wrong.",
"love julia xx i saw the specialist yesterday and she said it was ""normal"".",
she said if the lights turn into rainbow colours then there would be something wrong with my retina.,
back to the drawing board me thinks!!,
"i find it very frustrating when i ask about symptoms and am fobbed off with the ""it's nothing to worry about"" routine.",
"i want to know why it happens even if it is normal, so i have the facts and scientific explanation about what it is i'm experiencing, then and only then will i not worry about it!!!!",
grrrrr!!!,
ju x i had my eyes dilated a couple of weeks ago as a follow up to being told i had background retinopathy.,
got the result a couple of days ago and it said i now have moderate diabetic eye disease and am being referred to an opthamologist to see if i need an operation.,
"very concerned at how quickly it is progressing and so far i have only had a leaflet in the post and nowhere on that leaflet does it say anything about ""moderate"" diabetic eye disease.",
i have to look it up myself again.,
i'm sure the lights are something to do with it so i am going to be pushing hard for my sight....again.,
i did a full day of blood pricks yesterday and my highest peak was 9.2 after lunch but i was 1.7 after breakfast and mostly 4-6 the rest of the day.,
i have reduced my morning lispro so i don't plummet after brekkie.,
feel sorry for myself i thought the blindness would come much later in life.,
i don't even know what i'm doing wrong anymore.,
"i think it may be the pigmentosa, how do they test for it though?",
i will keep you posted.,
"hello, i've seen the ophthalmologist and asked about the blue lights and his verdict was ""some people see them and some don't"" that was very helpful as you can imagine.",
"he did say that the fatty lump that had leaked has healed over and the left eye is in excellent health considering how long i've had diabetes mellitus for, i have never felt so relieved and am trying very, very hard to get my readings under control as regards the amount of lows i'm having.",
i have looked up the flashing lights online again and found a passage describing them as follows: http://www.perret-optic.ch/optometrie/s ... lot_gb.htm there are so many different and frightening write ups that i have now given up looking because it is making me paranoid and sad!,
two months before the appointment i started taking lutein and bilberry supplements after reading some good things about them on this site and i am sure they have helped my eye health.,
"when i read the eye test chart it wasn't as blurred and i got to the bottom line instead of the 4th from the bottom on the last test, couldn't believe my eyes!!!!!",
i feel a lot better knowing i could save my sight and it's not all doom and gloom.,

"my blood glucose is not good, it's never below 9, i am on novorapid, levemir and metformin.",
i have an appt in march with the diabetic clinic and want to show them i have improved.,
"i am 5'4"" and 13st 7lbs, i have lost a few lbs within in the month but obviously want to weigh less.",
does anyone know anything about echinacea because in total i have been off work for 4 weeks in total within 2 months and i want to help my immune system and with the news of a 'flu epidemic hitting britain i don't want to take time off work again!,
thank you!,
"thank you, your comments have been noted.",
i do sometimes have a low carb diet but feel lightheaded and scared of getting a hypo when i do try this diet.,
i have to admit when my blood glucose goes below 8 i feel as if i'm having a hypo but surprised to see i'm still above 7 - is this because i'm used to feeling better when it is higher than the normal 4 - 7?,
"once again, thank you.",
once again thank you all for your replies!,
have a happy and healthy new year!,
hi everyone.,
it's been a while since i've been on.,
i hope y'all doing good tonight!,
i would ask this question on a food forum but why would i when this forum is full of great people who know a lot about food.,
i have never tasted them that i can remember.,
"i do not know what made me buy some but i bought 2 today and thought that i'd ask you all firstly, what they taste like and secondly what your favorite way(s) of cooking them are and what they go well with?",
anyone?,

in case you missed it...,
i bought sweet potatoes.,
lol... sorry..... as the thread title... sweet potatoes.,
hi ellagy.,
thanks for your reply.,
ahaaa... so they 'are' sweet in taste then.,
that's interesting....,
some people say that are not sweet... just sweeter than a normal potato.,
i suppose it depends on personal taste.,
is it me being stupid or unobservant but how do i quote someones text in a reply?,
ah its ok i found it...,
highlight the text and select reply ellagy said: far to sweet for my taste in veg!,
click to expand...,
so what do you personally class as a sweet vegetable?,
thank you all so much for your replies.,
there are some really good ideas you have posted.,
last night i actually tried roasting them in the oven.,
"i peeled, cut into big chunks and simmered for 5 mins then melted a small amount of goose fat and butter and added some freshly squeezed garlic.",
lol..,
i was expecting them to be crispy like the roast potatoes i sometimes make.,
maybe i didn't bake them for long enough.,
they were more mushy than crispy.,
wow they were nice though.,
next time(s) i will try some of your excellent recopies/ideas.,
lol...,
i like the toaster idea!,
i also think mashed would be v.nice too.,
thank you all again for your input.,
traceysteven said: spray them with the one calorie fry-light click to expand... hi traceysteven.,
thanks for your input.,
whats 'one calorie fry-light'?,
sounds good.,
however surely the 'one calorie' depends on how much you use.,
sorry... a bad attempt at a joke.,
does leaving the skins on add rigidity to the otherwise aubergine/courgette type soft texture?,
"maybe i used a little bit too much goose fat, butter and garlic when trying to roast my sweet potatoes last night ah ha.",
yes... that makes sense.,
i should have realized.,
thanks noblehead.,
"type 1 diabetic looking to take anabolic steroids, any advice greatly appreciated.",
"thanks, john.",
"but there is a difference between use and abuse, and i am going to cycle it properly, i am not going for the tablets as i understand they are more harmful, i am going for the injections (sustanon).",
"cycling it properly at the correct doses there isn't much risk of any side affects, just wondering if there are any diabetic people who take steroids on here?",
i am taking it for bodybuilding,
anyone know how much carb / sugar in a lemsip drink?,
got a stinking cold and would like to take on before work tonight!!,
"grazer said: sorry, just spotted your taking it before work, so maybe the whisky isn't such a good idea!",
:thumbdown: click to expand...,
"indeed not, ""i've got a cold"" isn't going to work if i get breathalysed i'm sure theres more than just paracetamol in lemsip (the ones i have in the cupboard are lemsip max flu) they do a much better job with a cold than just paracetamol.",
active ingredients list a decongestant i just noticed.,
mat,
a recent fasting glucose blood test indicated a level of 6.5mmol/l (pre diabetes - insulin resistance??).,
my gp is arranging for a further more detailed blood test and i'm scheduled to meet with him on the 21st october.,
does anyone know if glucobay (alpha-glucosidase) is suitable for pre-diabetics to avoid them getting type 2?,
thanks everyone for your input - really useful.,
i'll keep in touch after my visit to the gp on the 21st.,
one last question before i see the gp - is it okay to substitue canderel (aspartame) for sugar?,
thanks to everyone - so nice to have support.,
no carbs vs low gi carbs whaddayathink?,
"did anyone see the remarkable episode of ""trust me i'm a doctor"" on bbc 2 on wednesday or the follow-up article in the telegraph?",
"apparently if one cooks pasta, then cools it down and then reheats it it alters the structure of the starch converting it to 'resistant starch' which has a dramatic reduction on its effect re.",
"insulin, calories etc.",
try and see it on bbciplayer or read the article on-line ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/11167883/cool-and-reheat-pasta-to-make-it-less-fattening.htm .),
pasta could be back on the menu!,
the results of my recent visit to the gp was that the hba1c test came in at 6.7mmol/l so i guess i'm now a full member of the club!,
i have been prescribed 2 x 500mg metformin per day and have to cut down on carbs and watch the dairy food.,
any advice her would be welcome particularly the dairy food - i do use yogurt or should i say used to use yogurt.,
regards filmskate,
i expect we have all watched the tv programmes about very obese people and most of them had t2.,
now we know there is not yet a cure for diabetes so how is that when these people loose loads of weight they are told they do not have diabetes anymore...how does that work.,
read it on here and it was mostly about the newcastle diet and i read the professor tayors link where he said the diet was done for 8 weeks people had lost loads of weight on this diet and some here said their diabetes had been reversed so what happened when they stopped the diet did the weight and the diabetes come back.,
it would be interesting to know if those here who had done it were still diabetes free.,
can anyone ever truly be cured just by loosing loads of weight when we are told there is no cure for diabetes,
hi i have been registered for some time but this is my first posting.,
my name is nasir and i am 77 years old.,
i was diagnosed accidentally in 1997 with type 2 diabetes.,
"i am on gliclazide tablets, 4 daily.",
i have no diabetic complications.,
my question is rather unusual.,
i am very fond of very hot (40-43 c).,
"i usually have my bath before going to bed about 2100, about 2 hours after supper and it lasts for about 1 and a half hour.",
usually i have a fairly high protein supper.,
"now, the weird thing is that my blood sugar 2 hours after supper is in the region of 4-7 mmol/l.",
"however, after the bath it frequently rises to 9-12 mmol/l.",
i am a retired doctor and just cannot understand why a bath should raise my blood sugar.,
i have searched the internet and found almost always that most people find that a bath reduces their blood sugar!,
can someone give me some idea what is happening?,
many thanks.,
what amazing and helpful and so prompt responses!,
i have a lot to think and digest.,
"some of the things suggested i have tried; for example taking exactly the same meal 2 days running with all other variables controlled as far as possible, with amazing results!",
"2 days ago i had meatballs and pasta, exactly the same amount and at the same time.",
my bs 2 hours after supper was 3.8 on the first day and 4.2 on the second day.,
"on the first day i had a bath and my bs immediately after the bath was 9.6 and an hour later, 11.4!",
"on the second day with no bath, my bs immediately after the bath was 3.8!",
i didn't check it later.,
what can i say!,
i will come back later after i have tried some of the ideas suggested.,
many thanks for all your helpful responses.,
anyone on these boards suffer with foot drop or cmt ?,
as in charcot tooth marie sydromne i need some help with it as i have been having weakness in my knee and foot but my foot drop is so annoying its episodic and dosent seem to be getting better at all i'm in liverpool but can't seem to find a clinic only registered private ones i didn't know i could refer myself is there no fee involved ?,

this is what happens with mine and when my blood sugar is high my muscles go extremely stiff and my legs hardly work which is really strange i am being checked for a genetic muscle disease at the moment but i am trying to figure out if it is the muscle disease causing it or the diabetes my latest hba1c was 4.4 which is extremely love for a diabetic so im abit confused how it could be a neuropathic problem but stranger things have happened i guess i also suffer with extreme cramping in every muscle when my blood sugar fluctuates even 3 units does anyone have this ?,
"interesting i wonder if i am suffering some kind of motor neuropathic defect then which is causing these problems but i am not sure yeah my gp has already said he dosent know if it is diabetes or my muscle problem which is frustrating i'm going to see if they will check my thyroid and my testosterone levels as i don't feel right at all i have no sex drive either like nothing no interest in it and i hardly sleep at all which is making controlling my diabities so much harder that could be a potential i guess but its so difficult to stop having a hypo everyday my blood was 2.1 4 times today and it was high 3 times today and thats a good day my current dosage is 10 units morning , 8 units dinner , 15 dinner and 16 levimir at night feel like the doctors cant help me and neurology are at a loss",
good or bad for people with diabetes?,
i've always wanted to go and wondered what peoples views on them are.,
hello just wondered how long it takes to recover from a hypo or does it vary from person to person,
hi all just a quick question which is the best porriage to buy that dosnt spike your bs that much is there a certain one that is better than others thanks for any replies hi thanks for ur reply im same ive just had reading of 14 2 hours after im on no medication at the moment tho just waiting to go to clinic dont think i could eat what you eat tho as dont like almonds hi thanks for all your replies yes i do use quaker oats the ones in a packet as its easier for me to just grab one of those and make them when i get to work ...,

hello.,
does anybody have any information regarding conflicts between insulin (mixard) and liquid based anti acid solutions?,
my ten year old daughter (diagnosed june 09 type1) has recently complained of heartburn and a bloated feeling - not necessarily after eating.,
"she had one teaspoon late last night, but a few hours later her bg had dropped to 2.8 i could not get her bg to rise above 5 - no matter what she ate.",
"her monitors were checked yesterday with both control solutions, so i assume they are accurate.",
or any suggestions for natural remedies would be welcome.,
thanks in advance.,
thankyou for all replys.it was a doctor that gave her the meds for heartburn.i toke it to the chemists today to get it check out and he said it wasnt good for type1s and under 12s so given it a miss 2night and so far so good.,
"in reply to her hypo treat normaly harrybow sweets 6 2 biscuits and a sugar drink on that particular night hypo gel too which got her up for a while not long,she also had a sandwich.",
thanks everyone,
i've noticed with the onset of colder weather that my bg readings seem low when my hands are very cold.,
"so experimented today and got a reading of 4.1 with cold hands, warmed them up in water then got 5.9.",
happen to be trialing a libre which showed 6.6 throughout so to me this shows that the cold hands are affecting the reading.,
i can understand whu cold hands might maker it harder to get a decent drop of blood to test but not why the bg is affected.,
wonder if anyone has similar eperiences or any thoughts please?,
thanks that's some interesting thoughts thank you both.,
think i'll play with my spare meter and warm my hand when i need to drive!,
"yes, i always wash my hands first and test as i've been taught.",
i realise the limitations of the libre but notice than when i thoroughly warm my hand and retest the trading of much closer to the libre which is what i would expect from experience with it.,
i'm using a freestyle neo but hasn't access to a different make so will compare that next time i get really cold hands.,
bill_st said: recent reports show that the libre interstitial delay is 5-6 minutes not the frequently suggested 10-15 minutes.,
with a level trend arrow it is less than 5 minutes.,
"much more information here http://type1tennis.blogspot.be/search/label/freestyle libre , also info.",
on bg meter errors with temperature.,
and bg meter accuracy http://type1tennis.blogspot.be/2015/08/meter-vs-meter-or-quick-shot-down-of.html click to expand...,
thank you that's done really interesting reading.,
hadn't thought much about the algorithm that abbott use but clearly will impact on the values displayed wonder if it's published anywhere?,
i guess that shows the need to check with a finger portico test before reacting to a libre reading.,
although i gather abbott are pushing the libre as a replacement for bg testing or at least a reduction in it.,
the last couple of weeks i've been waking up with bl**dy cramp in the bottoms of my legs and having to do the leap out of bed and hop around thing on quite a few days.,
i have not changed any particular aspect of my diet which remains my low carb one.,
all that's happened in that last couple of weeks is a bit more weight has gone but i have had a noticeable improvement in fasting levels and my dawn phenomenon has all but gone.,
any idea's?,
anything i can eat or take that might help?,
thanks cheers geoff you might be onto something there.,
baking soda is an alkaline and in the past prior to swapping to the new improved me i consumed rennie with gusto which is of course the same kind of thing.,
renie had actually became quite a ritualised thing for me and i'd always take one prior to going to bed.,
as things have progressed my consumption of rennie has diminished drastically so much so that i fully expect bayer to have to issue some kind of profits warning :lol: i have even recently given up the bedtime one.,
so maybe that's it.,
btw for those of you still eating rennie.,
"hope you have swapped to the ""sugar free"" version as the original ones have 250mg of sugar and glucose in each tablet.",

click to expand... no i'm the other one wiflib!,
athough honoured to be compared against such an august sheep.,
:lol: so you reckon its something i just have put up with if i wish to actually keep my feet attached to the rest of me?,
"grazer, always have been a salt fiend and already put salt on my food but do take the point that my drop in consumption on low carb could account for it.",
"stephen, hate to say it but i take a specific potassium supplement because i had low potassium diagnosed around 18 months ago.",
"in my last blood tests it was back up to normal, however that blood test was only a while into low carb so i suppose it could be dropping again.",
i suppose a lot of this is your body adjusting to different levels of stuff.,
thanks phoenix i will be off to see the gp in a couple of weeks anyway to discuss my new hba1c and cholesterol tests which are about to be published.,
i'll mention it then and see if i can persuade them to do another batch of tests.,
i drink somewhere between 2 and 3 litres of liquid a day.,
"thanks again phoenix, sid, ladybird i will defo try the tonic water fix as of course i can occasionally add my favourite tipple to it",
just wondering if anyone has ever managed to get one of these.,
i'm interested to see what my fasting insulin level is but have just been informed by my surgery that this test os not available on the nhs and ... wait for it.. the diabetes nurse couldn't see that it would be any use to my condition.,
"so either she is covering her ignorance, genuinely thinks that it won't be useful or doesn't want to let me have it.",
hence my question.,
no-one that i have spoken to so far in the hcp realm seems to have ever heard of it although i do believe that it is fairly common in the us.,
looks like more private medicine for me if i want one.,
just found that medichecks offer it for 39.00 so have sent off for the kit.,
brighton private hospital 139.00 !,
will report back when it arrives.,
grantgam said: i'd be interested to hear about the standards and accuracy of the kits offered by medichecks.,
i'll be looking to purchase one of the thyroid ones if (in the unlikely event) i run into issues with getting antibodies and t3 tested on the nhs.,
do let us know how you go click to expand... not sure i'll be able to comment on accuracy unless i get a wacky result.. then again that could be my deranged metabolism!,
ringi said: i question if a fasting insulin level test will result in any action from most people or their doctor's.,
the only real use i can think of for the number is to warm someone who has reversed their diabetes that it is coming back before the bg start to increase.,
"(it's a useful number for a researcher to compare groups of people on different diets etc, so if the nhs did it for everyone it may be very useful to have in the national datasets.)",
click to expand... fine.. but of more concern to me was that no-one had ever heard of it.. then again if no-one can ever get it why would they..?,

evening all!,
recently i've been evaluating my type 1 diabetes life.,
i've had it for over 15 years now and still struggle to really get good control.,
"further to that, i enjoy a drink and have a sweet tooth.",
"i do test my blood as often as i can and bolus for meals so i'm not terrible, it's just things could be better.",
this week i went to the eye hospital and found out that i have background retinothopy and that if i don't get things under control my eyes are going to get severely worse.,
it was a real reality check.,
"with that, i think it's time to stop drinking beer while i get things under control (i work in media too so as you can imagine there's nights at the pub almost every week).",
boozing is the one thing that probably makes things worse; drinking several pints results in eating a dirty mcdonald's at the end of the night = high blood sugar.,
"so not drinking beer is probably going to be good in the long run, that said, i don't know if i could live being t total!",
"i received an email only this week from diabetes.co.uk with some interesting arguments about how weed can be beneficial for diabetes (obviously i know smoking in general is not good, that's why i quite weed and cigarettes five years ago), but it got me thinking.",
obviously we all need to enjoy life and if it's something that can help then why not?,
i'm not saying i'm going to turn to smoking weed etc.,
just for the sake of it but wondered if it's better than drinking?,
does anyone have any opinions/ advice on this?,
does weed help control your diabetes?,
is it better than drinking beer?,
i know the obvious answer is don't smoke or drink but it would be good to hear what you think!,
thanks for reading my essay and enjoy your weekend!,
"rick noblehead said: couldn't possibly comment on the weed question as i've never taken any recreational drugs, however you don't need to go teetotal if you believe this is going to be a struggle, its all about keeping things in moderation and choosing a drink that doesn't impact too hard on bg levels.",
"much like yourself i was a beer drinker in my youth but mainly stick to drinking red wine now, it has little effect on my bg levels and i just stick to having a few glasses on a weekend rather than drinking every night.",
"with regards to your background retinopathy, do try and get your diabetes under control and keep an eye on your bp and cholesterol levels too, also try and eat plenty fruit and veg as this is beneficial to eye health (my own ophthalmologist says the darker the fruit/veg the better).",
if you have a look at the following it has some excellent information and advice on diabetic retinopathy: http://www.diabeticretinopathy.org.uk/information_for_patients.html click to expand...,
thanks for the reply @noblehead !,
appreciate your comments.,
"i think with the beer; one leads to another, and when you're out with work/ friends you end up drinking too much and it becomes a viscous cycle.",
i'm planning on not drinking for a while to get things controlled especially as the retinopathy is concerning.,
i hear red wine is meant to be quite good for you too - shame i don't like it!,
littlegreycat said: in summary; weed=munchies.,
so don't go there!,
imho diabetes is hard for people with addictive personalities because carbohydrates are addictive.,
so self control is the way to go.,
anything that reduces your inhibitions is likely to cause you major problems.,
"tough call, but if your job means that you have to take alcohol or other substances just to cope, then you may have to chose between your job and your eyesight.",
if it is just a peer pressure social thing then grit your teeth and let them party on without you.,
"easy for me to say, of course........ click to expand...",
thanks for the reply @littlegreycat !,
i guess there's a lot of arguments for/ against for alcohol/ recreational drugs wherever you look!,
good to hear what people think to be honest.,
"i wouldn't say i've got an addictive personality, or that i have to take alcohol to cope in my job (i actually enjoy my job!)",
- it's just really social and as someone that enjoys a drink i often find i forget about having diabetes altogether.,
"now i'm at the stage where i think i should stop drinking because for me, this is something that is ruining my control and it results in a lot of high blood sugars.",
just been trying to research cannabis as there's some strong articles it and diabetes.,
"again, i know the obvious answer is reducing inhibitions and self control.",
thanks!,
ladybird64 said: hmm.,
no scientific proof but i'm guessing that beer is the worse of the two.,
"i am very, very closely acquainted with somebody who uses weed angelic , not in large amounts, but primarily because it helps relax muscle tension.",
"the obvious drawback that the person who shall remain nameless has, is increased appetite .",
"i should go with the obvious, and say don't do it, but it doesn't work like that.",
all i know is that it doesn't seem to increase bg levels at all.,
or so i've been told.,
ps.,
i have no idea why i have two happy emots with the word angelic in the middle.,
click to expand... yeh it's a tricky subject really!,
"i think the same can be said in terms of drinking alcohol too - if i'm drunk i'll eat and eat, and it's probably worse because in that tipsy state you tend to forget important things like testing your blood!",

"zoze_j said: hey rick, i'm probably going to get shot/lynched for saying this...",
"but i too enjoy a night out, and like to get drunk.",
very drunk!,
"so i try & stick to the lowest sugar/carb drinks, like vodka & diet coke/rum & diet coke.",
and if i do have anything with sugar in it (i am partial to malibu or taboo!,
"), i just look it up on my carbs & cals app, and put it in my pump.",
but generally i just try & stick to the carb free option!,
"that said, i'm aware of the impact alcohol can have on blood sugars, and causing them to drop, so i always make sure i have something to eat when i get home before i go to bed.",
i've learnt the hard way with that one!,
i also tend to test my sugars a lot when i'm out (albeit clumsily!),
click to expand... hey @zoze_j !,
haha course you won't get shot or lynched - you should be praised for speaking openly about it!,
i think people with diabetes should be encouraged to talk about these kind of things.,
i'm probably not a very good advocate for the condition but i'm planning on making changes!,
spirits and a diet drink is a good alternative - good shout!,
i usually just get on the beer and whatever shots are going!,
i too have learnt how much of an impact it can have - i don't usually test when i'm out as i tend to forget i even have diabetes.,
"going to cut out the drink i think until i get my sugars in order, i think alcohol is definitely not the best medicine!",
"edmac said: i remember when i cut down totally on drinking, in my late twenties.",
"i'd been drinking since i was 16, in traditional brit style - getting really ******.",
5 years at university meant i could be out four or five times a week.,
then when i started working at least two big sessions a week.,
but when i decided to stop it was a real eye opener going out and staying sober.,
i realised that far from being a social activity it's actually more anti-social.,
maybe that's more of a personal reflection on me and the people i used to drink with but that's a fact for me.,
and some of the food we used to eat after a night out.,
"my god, sober i wouldn't let it in my kitchen bin let alone eat it.",
sounds boring but i look back on 13 or 14 years of 'socialising' and think what a real waste of time.,
the people who were real friends i'm still in touch with.,
the people who were really just drinking friends i'm not in touch with.,
"maybe your experience will be completely different, but i suspect you will be at least as good at socialising sober as you are drunk.",
click to expand...,
thanks for the response @edmac sums it up perfectly really.,
"that's been pretty much the story of my life so far, and because the people you hang about with can do it you think 'well so can i'.",
"but then i guess reality kicks in and we learn that as much as we like to think we are invincible, we're not.",
i'm hoping i can follow your foot steps and cut down on drinking as it's the catalyst for all sorts of complications.,
"and i agree, those friends who truly understand will be your mates for life, those that don't come and go.",
"i think i'm pretty good at socialising sober, it'll be interesting to say the least.",
cheers!,
"bigboi said: very interesting subject, there are other posts on here which people swear weed does nothing wrong for them atall, i say if thats the case go for it, peronally i like a drink too, i do over do it sometimes but im used to knowing what my body can take for the most part, and luckily i love red wine so i could have a good night with that really.",
click to expand...,
it's really interesting and there's a lot of research that's been conducted - so it seems.,
"i think if i'm going to give up the drink for a while then it won't harm trying something else, especially that has the potential to have positive side effects.",
we'll see.,
i may also realise i don't enjoy smoking anymore and turn to the red wine!,
edmac said: it looks from your instagram links like you live in london?,
"you could spend a dozen lifetimes there without drinking a drop and still not get bored, there's so much going on!",
"i've spent the last 10 years in the rural midlands and managed - so if i can do it here you can definitely manage in london click to expand... that's right yeh, moved down to london from leeds 2 years ago!",
definitely lots of things to keep me busy without the need for boozing etc :-d,
hi just did my first self administered test.,
"i was wondering if this sounds reasonable (although the results after eating were bad, i'm wondering if it sounds like it shouldve been like this?)",
"just to give the prelude 8:00 hours 1x mandarin orange 40 minute swim 09:30 breakfast bowl of porridge with spoonful of sultanas and nuts skimmed milk 13:00 lunch 200g fresh salmon with leaf salad, 2x tablespoon of couscous, grated carrot 20 minute walk 18:00 hours 40 minute walk test 19:30 pre-meal 3.7 19:30 evening meal 200g baked beans 2 slices wholegrain bread 50g sliced ham dessert 2xshredded wheat with 2 tablespoons of 3 berry granola tested 21:00 hrs - 11.4!!!",
"my guess is that the worst here was the granola - turns out it has ""unrefined sugar cane"" as its 3rd highest ingredient!",
binned the rest of the pack - but is the rest of the evening meal one that would likely cause such a huge surge in bg?,
thanks for replies - very helpful!,
yikes - this isn't as straightforward as i thought!,
i deliberately ate carbs as i thought 3.7 was too low - obviously i went overboard!,
should i being trying to mix it up with slow release stuff?,
my meal was quite small compared to previous (pre-diag) portions - what is a reasonable amount of carbs per meal/per day?,
"i've been testing for about a week now, and other than the incident described above, i've been between 4 and 8.5 the whole time, generally sitting around the 6 mark.",
which according to what i've read in books etc seems to be about the right mark.,
didn't know there was a diet forum so will check that out - thanks for the tip!,
"hmmm - similar incident today dinner of salad made from 150g chicken breast, 250g iceberg lettuce, 6 strawberries, 1/2 apple, wensleydale cheese, 30g walnuts, sprinkle of mixed seeds and tablespoon of dressing (6g carb per 100g - tablespoon was about 30g i guess?)",
anyways - this took me from 5.6 pre meal to 10.4 nearly 2 hours later!,
thing is - i've had all those items before and none of them shot me up that high - is it to do with combinations or something?,
or was it quantity based?,
the above was essentially a big salad bowl worth of salad.,
"(say, about 3-5 cereal bowls?)",
any opinions greatefully received!,
thanks for all the wonderfuly informative posts and for all the time everyone took to express their opinions and advice here - i'm getting a better understanding through these boards and am highly confident that that particular spike was due to quantity and the imbalance of protien/carbs.,
"however ""healthy"" the particular carbs seemed, it was still a pretty big bowl of salad!",
"on the gi stuff, i can handle potatoes really well, but bread sends me pretty high.",
swings and roundabouts it seems!,
great!,
i checked it out - looks good indeed.,
"i'm gonna continue testing myself to see what/how much of different stuff i can handle, but i certainly like what you propose and my previous experience with atkins (did it for 6 weeks) was that i liked it after the induction was up!",
"i dont have many people i can talk to and although my doctors and diabetic nurse do help, i feel like im at a loss.",
"so, i have had type 1 diabetes for around 4 years now, found out when i was 18 and it was pretty much out of the blue.",
"there was no reason for this, no one in my family are t1, the reason i was told was that i had either gone through a really stressful time or traumatic experience.",
a few months after i found out i was rushed into hospital with dka with only hours left before i went into a coma.,
"although this was pretty scary for me and my family, i still struggled to cope afterwards.",
fast forward to last year i finally went on the dafne course which helped a lot.,
"but a few months afterwards, i kind of spiralled again.",
"see i have this mental attitude of, i dont want diabetes, i never asked for this, i dont know how i got it so why me?????",
i guess i have struggled with coming to terms with it since i found i have it 4 years ago but only really admitted it this year.,
"im constantly feeling lost, ive been prescribed anti depressants which were fine for a couple of weeks but now ive started to forget to take those.",
ive lost the routine of not checking my bloods regularly and just pretty much guessing from the carbs ive eaten of how much insulin i need to take.,
"there are other factors in my life that have led to depression which im working on, but the diabetes, well i feel like thats taken a hold on my life and im never going to get it back.",
"the hardest thing is, i know what i need to do, i have all the tools to help me.",
but i just really cant accept this life.,
i am getting a lot of sickness feeling upset tummy and generally feeling unwell it washes over me and knocks me for six i can eat when feeling this way it makes me feel weak i was wondering if anyone else gets this i was wondering as it's happened on several occasions if its link to my diabetes or not?!,
xx phonic2k said: welcome to the forum!,
"i'm not type 1, but if you are rollercoastering blood glucose levels, that can cause this sickness feeling.",
"it might be good to do basal testing, make sure you have that correct, then carb count and pre-bolus to prevent spiking.",
"many things like stress, gastroparesis, celiac disease, or a general cold can also cause this feeling, but if it continues i would advice you to contact your local doctor.",
click to expand...,
thank you very much i believe i am in pretty good control of my glucose levels but so think i will get some advice from a doctor just thought i'd ask in case i wasn't the only one that felt this way!,
thanks you xxx thank you very much appreciated!,
nice to have people around me that fully understand what i'm going through.,
"xxx thank you very much xx chloenelson1993 said: hi, i've literally just signed up to this to reply to this like an excited puppy.",
"i have also been experiencing sickness , slight dizziness and excess belching since december.",
i have spoken to two gp's and also my diabetic specialist nurse which none of have any idea what it is.,
gastroparesis was mentioned by my diabetic nurse but nothing more .,
"i have now had to persevere and keep contacting my gp asking for further tests as i cannot cope anymore, finally got an appointment on wednesday (so fingers crossed).",
mine is even worse if i drink alcohol and i am now so ill after even small amounts of alcohol (compared to that of 6 months ago).,
it has also caused me anxiety which i've never had before everytime it think about alcohol or everytime i feel sick i make myself worse with worry.,
i know i haven't been any help either your cade but thought i'd share that you are not alone and i'm now wonwring whether this is diabetes related.,

thank you for your lovely reply i can't see any obvious trend in my blood glucose levels and how i am feeling so i'm unsure whether it's related to my diabetes at all but will have a chat to my gp and see if they can give me any answers.,
i only put it on here as it's happened several times now and i have only been type 1 since last summer.,
"xx missd67 said: hi, i've been feeling exactly the same way for the last few weeks.",
i'm absolutely positive it's a viral thing.,

could some of you experts explain cholesterol levels to me please my readings are 4.6 total hdl 1.5 ldl 2.4 well for a start 1.5 and 2.4 do not equal 4.6 what is the rest then?,
my dr says its good the desmond course girls i went to last week say its not and should be under 4 so should it be under 4?,
if so which needs reducing and how?,
i have also seen mention of ratios etc so can anyone explain that too.,

"how important is it that metformin is taken with food, and if it is essential, how much food?",
"i found 1 the in morning and 1 in evening easy to remember, but i've just progressed to 3 metformin a day (my 3rd wk on meds) i'm finding it difficult to have 3 meals at regular intervals to fit in my 3 a day tablets.",
on a weekday breakfast is not a problem as i get up for work around 7 each morning.,
lunchtime comes a bit more difficult.,
"having probably grazed on fruit during the morning, coupled with being busy at work, i tend to start feeling peckish around 3pm or later.",
if i take my tablet late afternoon i have to make sure my evening meal is later than usual to even out the medication times.,
"can i have the tablet with an apple, or does it have to be a meal?",
then there's the weekend.,
"where i usually have breakfast around 7am on weekdays, on sat and sun i have a long lay-in, so it's nearer 11.30am usually having brunch.",
i know this is a bit late for my tablet but then my next meal would be in evening.,
now i have this 3rd tablet to take in the middle somewhere.,
"alternatively, can i take the weekend am tablet when i wake up without the breakfast ( i usually initially wake up around 8am but rollover and doze)?",
"i didn't have a problem with twice a day, but the doctor has prescribed it for 3 times, but i had to start them slowly.",
"just 1 in morning first week, then i in morning and i in evening 2nd week and so on.",

hello everyone i was wondering if some of you could post your highest blood sugar levels.,
:?,
: over the past month i have had readings off the scale (h1 - on my meter) have just started on glicazide and a low carb diet - and things are improving.,
"16.3 on last reading thanks gill erin said: 30 - sorry to brag but i was (last year) very ill for a month, with coma-like naps for 4-6 hrs per day and constant blue urine sticks - ketosis; very tired and constantly drinking water and voiding; this was after my 6-month flu and bronchitis, but i should *note* that i also had the same symptoms on a smaller scale for quite a few years prior to this; i hope chronic diabetes did not do too much damage - don't know if it did; with the meds i am fine now, average of 6.2 every 3 mos.",
click to expand...,
thanks everyone erin - you describe exactly how i felt a week back.,
glad to hear you are better now hello everyone i had to go to a&e last sunday and yes i had a long wait but there was a problem with referral.,
when they sorted that out - they were marvellous.,
had me hooked up in minutes.,
i sometimes knock it - but i thank heaven for the nhs gill thanks everyone all; the best to everyone who has shared their results.,
have had similar very high results myself - as high as 45 and like lh felt ok except for incredible thirt and tiredness.,
now i check after every new food and have got my levels down to less than 12.,
good luck to all gill,
just had my test results back.,
hba1c is 33 again so happy with that.,
but my triglyceride 0.49 is marked as abnormal.,
range 0.80-2.00.,
doctor did not mention it and only found out when i went though all the results.,
does anyone understand this?,
sunnyexpat said: low triglyceride can be caused by several things.,
"what have you done to reduce your hba1c though, as this can lower your triglycerides temporarily, click to expand... my hba1c was 33 last august.",
i've kept diet almost the same but taking a few more ricks and finding what i can eat.,
i am walking a lot more so that i can eat more as i like my food.,
"a lot of veg, protein from eggs, cheese, fish, chicken and occasional red meat.",
very small amounts of potato and occasional small amounts of rice or pasta.,
"bread is mostly lidl rolls or livlife bread, walking is often about 7 miles a day.",
no other exercise.,
my bmi is 19.6 so at the very low end of normal.,
when diagnosed it was 25 so at the very top end of normal.,
my weight has been stable for almost 9 months and i am trying to keep it there.,
i now think doctor must think i am under weight as i've just read the bone scan form he wants me to have which says low mbi.,
"brunneria said: well, my basic understanding is that trigs are at least partially affected by food prior to the test (while ldl and hdl are, by and large not ).",
so was the test fasting?,
"unless a cholesterol test is fasting, the dietary trigs mess things up, and raise your total cholesterol.",
"we have had people posting here to say that their trigs have been hugely elevated by all-you-can-eat-and-drink holidays, and their nurse has said 'just been on hol?",
stuffed your face?,
that is why your trigs are so high.,
come back in 3 weeks and we will test again.',
"so presumably if you have been dieting or strictly controlling carbs, alcohol and/or fat (not sure about the fat part, actually) then i would expect trigs to drop - for the length of the diet, but they are going to rise again as soon as you re-feed carbs.",
"sikaris, in one of his you tube videos says that if you have raised trigs, it is a good indicator of a fatty liver, either alcoholic, or not.",
he says aim for trigs below 1.0 if i remember correctly.,
"i am tempted to tell you how envious i am that you have such low trigs, but in all honesty i do not know if there is a minimum level for them to be healthy.",
it took me a year and transitioning down from lc at 50-80g to vlc at 30-40g carbs a day to lower my trigs from 1.1 to below 0.9.,
click to expand...,
thanks @brunneria i had tried to slightly reduce the fat for the couple of weeks before the test as i didn't want another lecture on statins.,
otherwise diet was normal for me.,
"i don't very low carb but probably less than 100 a day, could be a lot less as i haven't been weighing foods for a few months.",
i just eat to my meter.,
i have been trying to add extra carbs to see what happens but am taking this very slowly and carefully.,
i did know not to have alcohol the day before but otherwise i do have a very small glass of red wine most days.,
"sunnyexpat said: low bmi can cause low trigs, in a situation similar to borderline malnutrition, as there is no spare fat on your body, so you use all the fat you eat/manufacture as trigs from carbs, and you are burning energy with the 7 mile walk.",
"very low fat diet can, but you're obviously ok there.",
statins can force them down as well.,
"there are other medical reasons, but you're not too far below the minimum, and it's easily possible you just have a very good balance of energy in = energy out, so you're using the trigs and clearing them quickly, and trickling more in, rather than overloading in one go.",
"so long as your feel ok, still have enough energy, don't feel tired, i'd carry on doing what you are doing.",
click to expand...,
"thanks @sunnyexpat i'm not low fat diet, when i was recording exactly what i was eating it was well over 50% fat.",
i do feel lacking in energy but thought this was diabetes or my age.,
may cut the walking a bit.,
ickihun said: the higher the triglyceride level the lower the hdl level (good cholesterol).,
therefore lower triglyceride level = high hdl good cholesterol level.,
can you have too good a cholesterol level?,
"triglycerides are a form of dietary fat found in meats, dairy produce and cooking oils.",
...,
it usually takes a few hours for triglyceride levels to return to normal.,
"when triglycerides are cleared from the blood less quickly, less cholesterol is transferred to hdl particles.",
sluggish fat has less chance of becoming good cholesterol!,
other fats.,
brown fat the bad fat which blocks insulin isn't cholesterol but fat produced by the body through energy not being used up from diet.,
i think!,
click to expand...,
thanks @ickihun i think i'm very pleased with my results.,
"i had got very stressed as i had been told to phone last tuesday for the results and the receptionist told me she couldn't tell me, so obviously there was something wrong and i would have to speak to the doctor.",
i was petrified going in there this morning.,
hi @noblehead it's on a copy of the printout from the lab to the doctor.,
"i had read your quote and was surprised that mine stated ""abnormal"" against the figure.",
i was also surprised that the upper limit was quoted as 2 as i had understood 1.7 was the upper limit.,
"i can't see a lower limit on my previous printout, so this may be new?",
my previous trigs were 0.8 which i had been happy with and so had the doctor.,
he did not mention my trig figure to me and it was only when i got home and looked through all the pages i found it.,
the more i read the happier i am with it.,
i'm not malnourished but my weight is towards the lower end of normal.,
it was getting my weight down that helped control my blood sugars so i don't want to put any weight on nor do i want to lose any more.,
"my doctor had told me when first diagnosed low fat and high carbs, and from reading on the web no fat or minimal fat can cause low trigs.",
"i used my meter to find what i could and couldn't eat so didn't follow his advice, but i had told him i had needed to reduce the carbs and he had seemed pleased at the time.",
i am not following any low fat diet but do try to eat the good fats most of the time.,
thanks @shar67 my serum tsh (which i think is thyroid) 1.77 mu/l reference 0.27-4.20 so that would seem normal.,
"hi guys,i am really worried about my father-in-law he is suffering with severe pain due to diabetes type 2 and also seems to be suffering with peripheral neuropathy in his big toe!",

"i worry about using anything electrical when it comes to nerve damage, the reason i ask this question is because i have also suffered nerve damage due to a viruis called 'ramsay hunt syndrome' i also took gabapentin, various people suggested i try the tens machine and other stimulants to help repair the damaged nerves but then later i was advised this would actually do more damage to the nerves sorry for essay!!!",
but i would apprecicate any knowledge and advice any of you may have!,
i wish all of you some sort of relief from your suffering many thanks samantha thank you so much for this information!,
i will pass this on and find out if the doctor thinks this will be ok for him!,
i wish you all the best with your condition and hope it keeps improving!,

"hi, i am posting on behalf of my brother who is type 1 diabetic & currently in hospital with uncontrolled diabetes.",
"the hospital, after 2 months, haven't been able to stabilise his blood sugar (no diabetic menu, no meal monitoring, little interaction with diabetic consultant) and he has had hypos at night and daytime levels reaching to high 30s.",
there is a discharge meeting thursday and the recommendation will be for a nursing home.,
my brother is a very fit 64 year old and i would like to know if people with similar challenges have been able to live on their own with district nurses (and family support) without being shut up in an institution .,
"i am not sure we will have any say on the matter, but i would like him to be in a greater care housing complex/sheltered housing with medical input and quality of life...",
thanks for any input.,
i need info pls.,
"fairygodmother said: hi @ba66 , what insulin have the hospital put your brother on?",
"has he any other health issues, despite being very fit?",
are you in the u.k.?,
"most people with type 1 in the u.k. look after themselves with support from a gp, a diabetes specialist nurse and a consultant who they see approximately once a year.",
most will be able to participate in a dafne course (it has different names in different parts of the country) which gives the skills required to match insulin doses to carbohydrate eaten.,
how long has your brother had t1?,
has he always had problems keeping his blood glucose under control?,
it seems that either the hospital has been inefficient in applying medical knowledge to your brothers health problems or there are some other underlying issues.,
"without more information its difficult for us to comment: we cant tell you what to do, we can only offer suggestions or tell you things that weve discovered for ourselves as a result of living with the condition.",
"your brothers young to be in sheltered housing, so im assuming that he may not find it easy to look after himself if thats what youre wishing for him.",
is this so?,
click to expand... hi thank you for your reply.,
"sorry not to be clear, was feeling bit deperate yesterday, things look less bleak today.",
i appreciate ppl can't comment on an individual's situation and i didn't give full info or the post would have been v long!,
"was mainly wanting to find how ppl coped with problematic blood sugars in a community, rather an institution setting.",
chris has had t1 i think about 10 years.,
i live in uk but other side of country and don't drive so been in contact by fone.,
we found a letter from gp saying his sugar levels were too high from 3 years ago.,
i'm afraid he doesnt take his health very seriously and not very educated on dietary stuff.,
he was admitted for very high blood sugar and mental confusion 2 months ago and the hospital aren't unable to regulate it.,
it was 22 before breakfast this a.m. my sister and i are wondering if he has brittle diabetes and are trying to get him seen by diabetic consultant whom he has had scant contact with being put on general medical ward.,
"he has had tests and is clear for dementia though i think that will ve the fallback diagnosis as they don't know what's causing the muddledness, though a dr did say the persistent high-low swings could be causing his confusion (he's generally fine but dodgy in some areas) thank you for your input.",
"dcukmod said: @ba66 - mulling this over a bit more, is your brother being transferred somewhere to convalesce from his current predicament?",
"my (non-diabetic, normally in good health) neighbour, when she had her first hip replcaement in her mid-60's (i think), had a really rough time with the anaesthetics and wasn't able to recover as quickly as expected, so he wa actually transferred to our local cottage hospital with is really for those unable to cope at home any more, with a few rooms for convalescence.",
it could be somethng like that?,
"otherwise, i'm with the others in astonishment that your brother would be being sent to a long term nursing home, rather than some form of sheltered or supported care, in his own home or in a sheltered housing community.",
all very puzzling.,
click to expand... thankyou for your reply.there don't seem to be convalescence homes any more so we are treating the nursing home as an interim option until we get sheltered housing.,
there is a place near me that has very good facilities and he would still have independence with district nurses coming in.,
"i am hopi g he can get better care in nursing g home rather than the hospital (east surrey) who, in this case, don't seem to treat diabetics with much specialused care.",
"kk123 said: ba66, obviously we can only go on the content of your post which says your brother is a very (mentally as well?)",
fit person whose only issue is out of control diabetes.,
if this is the case do not be bullied into going along with what the social services/hospital say.,
it is the choice of your brother and the only way they can force it upon him is if they are saying he is mentally unfit to decide for himself.,
you as his family also has to be listened to.,
"there are other options before a nursing home, i cannot believe they are suggesting this and you can rest assured it will be because it is easier for them to monitor your brother in a home with 24/7 nurses rather than visit him every day under the district nurses.",
"don't get me wrong, if your brother is regularly falling on the floor, going unconscious at all times and clearly a danger whilst living on his own then you wouldn't want that to continue if he lives on his own.",
there are so many factors that come into this so it is hard to advise.,
"my mum was in the exact same position albeit older and after she could no longer live alone she went into accommodation with a warden, then a few years later sheltered accommodation, one with a 24/7 team (but not a nurse), and eventually a nursing home.",
"please read up on your brother's rights with regard to this issue, my mum had district nurses coming in 3 times a day in the sheltered accommodation which we had to fight for.",
"the social services will always suggest what is easier for them, i genuinely think they do care but they are restricted because of the nhs finances etc so you can guarantee they will take the easiest route.",
"does your brother normally live alone?, please tell us more about his daily life and how exactly does his diabetes manifest itself.",
good luck x click to expand...,
thank you for your reply.,
i didn't put everything in post as i needed some general input about options for living independently.,
unfortunately he has some mental confusion alongside the blood sugar swings.,
"it seems he has had uncontrolled diabetes for possibly 3 years so my feeling is that this has affected brain chemistry, the doctor agreed that long term hypos and hypers would be detrimental but there is no data for this.",
easier to put him down as a dementia diabetic patient.,
he had 3 tests for dementia and passed all of them but he needs to go in a box.,
my brother normally lives alone.,
i can't give day to day info on his diabetes am afraid as live out of his area and he never spoke about his health.,
we are trying to get diabetic consultant on the case for now and treat nursing home as convalescence til we can find a nice flat somewhere suitable with family contact.,
thanks a lot.,
"dcukmod said: baa - was your brother admitted to hospital because of his uncontrolled diabetes, or was his diabetes uncontrolled, as well as having another health issue, requiring the admission?",
"i ask because, as i'm sure you may be aware, so many other factors like infection, pain, use of certain medications, like steroids for other ""stuff"" and stress, to name just a few things can really cause the blood sugars to go a bit wonky to say the least.",
i guess i'm trying to work out if there's a chicken before the uncontrolled blood sugars egg.,

this forum has been very useful as my sister and i are very ignorant of whats available and difficult to put options forward about management at home rather than a nursing home.,
he is a self funder so perhaps it's easier too....,
many thanks.,
"kk123 said: ba66, obviously we can only go on the content of your post which says your brother is a very (mentally as well?)",
fit person whose only issue is out of control diabetes.,
if this is the case do not be bullied into going along with what the social services/hospital say.,
it is the choice of your brother and the only way they can force it upon him is if they are saying he is mentally unfit to decide for himself.,
you as his family also has to be listened to.,
"there are other options before a nursing home, i cannot believe they are suggesting this and you can rest assured it will be because it is easier for them to monitor your brother in a home with 24/7 nurses rather than visit him every day under the district nurses.",
"don't get me wrong, if your brother is regularly falling on the floor, going unconscious at all times and clearly a danger whilst living on his own then you wouldn't want that to continue if he lives on his own.",
there are so many factors that come into this so it is hard to advise.,
"my mum was in the exact same position albeit older and after she could no longer live alone she went into accommodation with a warden, then a few years later sheltered accommodation, one with a 24/7 team (but not a nurse), and eventually a nursing home.",
"please read up on your brother's rights with regard to this issue, my mum had district nurses coming in 3 times a day in the sheltered accommodation which we had to fight for.",
"the social services will always suggest what is easier for them, i genuinely think they do care but they are restricted because of the nhs finances etc so you can guarantee they will take the easiest route.",
"does your brother normally live alone?, please tell us more about his daily life and how exactly does his diabetes manifest itself.",

ok it's probably best not eating any of them but if you had to eat one for health which would you choose?,

not normal for a non-diabetic.,
how much carbs are you eating?,
really you want your blood sugar to not go above 7.8 an hour after you eat.,
try reducing the amount of carbs until that happens.,
"also, check out the low carb threads on the forum.",
eating government recommended amount of carbs will slowly kill a type 2.,

it really is not a good idea to eat too much bread.,

"water is the best option, either tap water (straight from the fridge is better) or sparkling mineral water, maybe with a bit of lemon or lemon juice added.",
tea and coffee without sugar and either a dash of milk or as much cream as you wish.,
red wine in moderation.,
"if you browse round you may find very low carb drinks, but do read the labels and look for ""total carbs rather than ""of which sugars"".",
fruit juices are generally a no-no.,
"i'm not the best person to advise because i've rarely drunk anything other than water, tea or coffee, and orange juice (which i had to give up).",
oh and red wine!,

hi yesterday i went to the walk in centre thinking that i had a uti but when they test it it showed that i have a high level sg in the urine.,
she also tested my blood glucose and that was 10.5 and that was just over two hours after a meal.,
"i checked at 8:30 that was six hours and it was still 9.5 and i hadnt had anything to eat since my christmas meal of soup and salmon with peas, carrots and sprout and jacket potato with butter.",
what should been after 6 hours after a meal.,
this morning it was 5.3 after 17.5 hours without any food.,
i did drink water during that time.,
i drink around 2.5 to 3 litres of water a day.,
i have been having problems with urinated a lot more over last six months especially at night some nights i get up up to 3 times a night.,
i have a telephone consultation with my gp today to see what he wants me too do.,
dee :clap: just spoken to my gp he said there is nothing to worry as it seems that i have sugar in my urine most of the time when it has been checked.,
my last fbg test was in the normal range.,
i will still carry on checking to see if there is a problem.,
he also said that 10.5 is normal after 2.5 hours after a meal.,
"dee yes was in mmol, i have never been offered a glucose tolerance test none of gp practices have considered it.",
my brother has t2 diabetes and his surgery also missed it for quite a few years before the looked at his blood result again and they noticed that his blood sugars were high 2 years before.,
since his gastric sleeve operation his sugars are nearly back in the normal range in total he has lost over 10 stone.,
"when he had his surgery he was 21stone 9lbs and now he is just over 14 stone which isnt bad, he had his op in february this year.",
i think the first urine test that came back abnormal was in in 1991 but they werent worry then either.,
how should i approach my gp about having the gtt to see if that show up anything.,
at times i have problems with my sugars going very low and then i feel ill.,
i am also having problems at night with pee'ing two or three times a night which isn't normal.,
currently i am having problems with sleeping i am struggling to sleep and to stay a sleep.,
i have been put on something to help with this problem tonight will be day seven so far i dont think that they are helping at the moment.,
i will go back to my gp on monday if there hasnt been any improvement.,
i just want some sleep that is a good quality and good quantity as only getting one or two hours together isnt helping my day time fatigue levels.,
today i havent had a nap during the day so by 9pm i will be struggling to stay awake but i will try and hold out until 10pm so that i keep to the same bedtime as i normally do.,
i am trying to get up and go to bed at the same time so that my body clock stays in the correct time zone.,
"by the way i have fibromyalgia and me and also major allergies to drugs, foods and chemicals so it can be fun trying to work out what i can and cant have.",
i am allergic to aspirin so that will be fun as i know they normally want people with diabetes to have an aspirin as day but that wont be happening.,
dee :lol: another bad night where i havent had a lot of sleep and i have got up with another headache.,
just done my blood sugar and it was 4.5.,
before i went to bed it was 10.2 which was 2.5 hours after a gluten free pizza.,
i will take some paracitamol to try and get rid of a headache.,
dee hi slightly off topic but i was wondering if the high sugar levels and overactive bladder problems could be part of the problem as i was diagnosed in 2003 with overactive bladder syndrome and my bladder can hold up to one litre of urine.,
my problems have been getting worse over the last 21 years.,
i am running out medication to control the problem currently i am on the last medication for the bladder.,
i have just had it increased to the maximum amount so hopefully it will work for a while as if this fails then i dont know what i will do.,
i am not due to see my urologist until september/october 2013 so ages away yet.,
i did monitor my bg for a while from february to april and again had some quite high reading the highest ever reading was 12.4 on 22 february but other have been over 11.3 over that period of time.,
i will get some more finger prickers things today so that i can carry on checking my blood glucose.,
currently i take quite a cocktail of drugs already.,
currently i take 31 pills a day.,
dee hi this morning i took my bg was 7.7 which is high.,
i am not sure why it is so high.,
again i had another bad night where i couldnt get back sleep after i got up to go to the toilet at 3am.,
i got up at 7:30am.,
dee hi i do have regular blood tests to see that my bg is doing and also the throid is doing.,
it always comes back in the normal range around 6.5.,
dee hi yesterday i had another hypo where my blood glucose dropped down to 3.7.,
i knew there was a problem because i wasn't feeling to great.,
i couldnt check my bg until after church had finished.,
i had a hypo in january this year as well but this one wasnt as bad as that one.,
dee hi should i be worried as i have had two hypo's in the last two days.,
"yesterday it was 3,3 and today it was 3.6.",
"i have a headache, dizy blurred vision and a few other symptoms of a hypo.",
i took some dextro tablets and 15 mins and it was 10.7mmol/l.,
i have had something to eat and hopefully that will help.,
i have rang nhs direct and they are going to get a doctor to ring within 6hrs and yes 6hrs.,
they will have to come to the house as i been told that i cant use my electric chair so that means i cant get to the out of hours centre.,
i know that this means that other people would have to wait longer to see the doctor.,
what do you think the doctor will do as currently not a diabetic.,
dee hi i have had another hypo again this afternoon is that is now 4 since last sunday .,
i will be going the doctors on monday about this as its not normal.,
i spoke to an out of hours nurse early this afternoon she said that i am doing everything right to get my sugar levels up and she suggested that i go and see my gp on monday.,
dee hi i been to the doctors and she will be sending me to see a endocrinologist as it not normal for someone that isn't diabetic to getting these hypo's.,
she wasn't that happy that i am testing my blood but hopefully i might be able to see what is causing this problem.,
i am eating a normal diet so not sure where to go now.,
i was looking at my diary and at the january and the middle february i had 6 hypo's so i will tell the docor about these too.,
she said that my kidneys are just leaky and that is fine.,
hopefully they will be able to find out what is going on.,

"hi there, i dont have diabetes but my partner is an insulin dependant diabetic.",

hi.,
my name is lesley and i'm fairly newly diagnosed with type 2.,
"i was started on 1x500 sr metformin and had all kinds of horrible side effects, however when i started on week 2 2x500 sr metform i started with painful joints, lower back pain but the worst was my knee - the site of an old injury where i have a squishy lump.",
the dn said it was the cold weather and advised stopping for a few days.,
i did and felt wonderful - no pain.,
i went back on 1x500 and on day 6 the knee pain started again with a vengeance - my lumpy knee throbs.,
i could barely walk on it.,
the doc told me to stop meds immediately.,
i've since been back to be told by another doc that i have a bad back and sciatica.. erm no.,
it all stops when i'm off the meds.,
does anyone else suffer like this please???,
i'm sad as clearly docs don't believe me!,
i'm still off meds and i'm great but they want me back on them.,
any advice please?,
thank you.,
i was starting to feel like i was making it up.,
the doc who said it was sciatica advised she wants me back on metformin sooner rather than later but i know it's the tablets causing my pain.... and oh boy do i know what the other side effects are !!!,
these tablets just don't sit well with me.,
i will suggest a different tablet.,
thank you.,
hi.,
i have thought and am actively sorting my diet but my dn nurse wouldn't just let me do diet alone.,
she said that if i lost weight (and i need to drop about 3st) then i could maybe come off the meds then.,
thanks for the link.,
i will have a good look.,
do you think i should refuse meds for now and just continue with the diet.,
my bloods are just at 6.5 .,
hi berylc.,
funnily enough that's the book i have.,
he just happened to be on tv the weekend after my diagnosis.,
how's that for timing eh.,
my word.. 4yrs of it.,
i'm glad you have sorted it.,
i am really going to give it my best shot as i just don't want to be on tablets if they are going to make me poorly.,
"and thank you, i think i will stand my ground for now.",
thank you.,
bulkbiker said: what was your most recent hba1c?,
click to expand...,
most recent bloods were taken january and the result was 6.5.,
"i don't do daily readings (not got a blood monitor) but the doc who advised i stop the meds did a quick check and on that day my reading was 5.4 at about 12noon, an hour after food.",
in your situation i would probably try to do control by diet only for a few months but again i think that would be with regular testing so i know how i was doing rather than rely on infrequent tests at the docs.,
[/quote] thank you for your sound advice hun.,
i've decided i am going to do a 3 month trial.,
i'm going to ask my nurse for a personal meter and test frequently whilst implementing a low carb diet and doing more exercise.,
i'm going to log everything!,
hopefully i can produce a drop.,
if not then i know it's time to try alternative tablets.,
i get my bloods tested at docs next week so this will give me a perfect starting point.,
watch this space.,
thank you for the advice.,
"resurgam said: i was put on metformin and statins at the same time, so i am not sure which did what, but pain in the lower back, a few inches each side of centre, pains in my muscles - my lower legs are still not feeling right, the left one in particular, fiendish itching, plus being unable to learn or remember - losing the car at the supermarket just before christmas was quite frightening.",
i stopped taking the tablets but my memory is still poor.,
"i should take my thyroxine tablets every morning, and i am constantly forgetting.",

"hello all, i am wondering if anyone else has had experience with being wrongly diagnosed?",
i got diagnosed in april 2016 with type 2 and i can't help but wonder if i have been wrongfully diagnosed.,
from what my diabetic team have told me type 2 comes on gradually over time which is correct with what i have also read but before i was diagnosed after having a lumbar puncture - two maybe 3 months before that i had a blood test and nothing shown up to suggest diabetes.,
from what i have read and been told once again type 1 comes on suddenly in children and in adults it can take a month or two and i can't help but wonder if i am actually type 1 and not two as none of the medication i have been given to treat type 2 is working.,
i am on yet another course of medication which isn't working so i want to know if anyone else has ever been wrongfully diagnosed?,
"thank you azure said: hi @jenlou yes, quite a few adults are misdiagnosed with type 2 but actually have type 1.",
"some doctors seem to,assume that any adult must be a type 2 as type 1 is a 'child's condition' but it's not.",
"recent research has shown that more people are diagnosed with type 1 over the age of 16 than under 16, and that the age at diagnosis is fairly evenly spread across the whole age range.",
what are your blood sugar results like?,
"if you're concerned you may be type 1, ask for a gad test and a c peptide test.",
"click to expand... hi my levels are all over the place and never lower that 15. i have been placed on all types of medication and none of them are working but my gp doesn't care about it azure said: ok, 15 is to high, as i'm sure you know.",
i'd go back to your gp and ask for a referral to a specialist.,
"most gps don't have the knowledge about diabetes that is needed to,decide a 'type'.",
a specialist would be able to give a better opinion.,
"in the meantime, you could ask your gp to do the tests mentioned above so that the results will come though quicker (the gad test can take a while).",
you could also ask if insulin would be an option while you're waiting for your appointment as that should control your blood sugar and also would avoid you taking any medication that might not be appropriate if you were to be type 1.,
click to expand...,
i was diagnosed at the hospital and i know they're high.,
"i have just done a finger prick before lunch and my levels are 26 at the moment and that's after taking my medication earlier, i'm just getting very annoyed with alm the messing around they are doing with me kristin251 said: i was diagnosed at age 50.",
3 years ago.,
anything can bring it on.,
i believe mine was from a nasty virus.,
"doesn't matter, it is what it is now i had the same trouble.",
boeing prescribed meds that either didn't work or made things worse.,
my suggestion is to get the tests azure mentioned as soon as possible.,
have you told anyone the meds aren't working and how high you've been?,
my concern is some of the type 2 meds work on the pancreas and squeeze it to produce insulin.,
if your c pepetide is very low you want to preserve any pancreatic function you still have and get on insulin.,
insulin is not nearly as bad as i had imagined.,
the finger sticks hurt much worse.,
some fortunate people are able to use insulin temporarily to bring high bs down and give the pancreas a rest.,
sometimes we get too high ( maybe from your puncture) and the pancreas can't keep up or catch up.,
unfortunately i am not one of those people.,
those tests will answer your questions and give you a diagnosis.,
best wishes and please get this sorted out as soon as possible!,

your blood sugars are way too high.,

i have copied this from the website http://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes-medication/diabetes-and-victoza.html how does victoza (liraglutide) work?,
"liraglutide functions over a 24-hour period to lower both fasting and post-prandial blood glucose levels, and help people with diabetes to manage their blood sugar.",
liraglutide works by stimulating the secretion of insulin as well as suppressing the secretion of glucagon in a glucose-dependent manner.,
"the drug also delays gastric (stomach) emptying, slowing down the absorption of glucose by the gut and reducing appetite.",
who can take victoza?,
victoza is prescribed for people with type 2 diabetes that are obese and are suffering with significant problems as a result of their weight.,

are you sure you understand what foods make you fat etc?,
we have all been fed information from the 'experts' based often on nonsense data.,
beware nhs dieticians as they also may proffer the same invalid info.,
fat doesn't make you fat but carbs can readily do this if you eat too many.,
the body easily metabolises carbs into glucose and if in excess the liver stores it as fat (even more so with fructose).,
fat goes thru a much more complex process in the body and isn't so easily stored as fat.,
btw i'm very cynical about the salt thing.,
"yes, if you have a tendency to high bp then perhaps be careful but there is little evidence that the average person needs to worry unless it pushes up your bp.",

"as for medication, my practice nurse put me on metformin which after 4 days i had to come off of, as i lived in the toilet, and was afraid to even think about leaving the house, she then put me on gliclazide which i was on for 3 weeks and gained weight, i rang the surgery to speak to her and told her i could not take any medication which caused me to put weight on, she informed me that it was one of the side effects - so i came off that (seemed to me it defeated the purpose somewhat) i am now on my fith day of forxiga dapagliflozin 10mg daily, she told me you can actually lose weight with this one.",
"i have to say that prior to diagnosis when it was me who asked for a blood test because i hadn't been firing on all cylinders for approx 18 months, and also had skin problems which i've never had in my life, i just knew there was something wrong with me, also the customary drinking and running to the loo both day and night.",

met isn't that effective on lowering numbers but does help insulin resistance - just keep taking them as you have been doing - as long as they are evenly spread.,

"i tried to reduce my carbs, also maintain daily excise, 1- 1.5 hour.",
seems my high hba1c was due to my mistake that i stopped my metformin altogether instead of gradually reducing my metformin dose.,

"daisy1 said: @tan800 hello and welcome to the forum as mentioned above, here is the basic information we give to new members and i hope you will find it useful.",
ask more questions when you need to and someone will help.,
basic information for new members diabetes is the general term to describe people who have blood that is sweeter than normal.,
a number of different types of diabetes exist.,
a diagnosis of diabetes tends to be a big shock for most of us.,
"its far from the end of the world though and on this forum you'll find well over 147,000 people who are demonstrating this.",
"on the forum we have found that with the number of new people being diagnosed with diabetes each day, sometimes the nhs is not being able to give all the advice it would perhaps like to deliver - particularly with regards to people with type 2 diabetes.",
the role of carbohydrate carbohydrates are a factor in diabetes because they ultimately break down into sugar (glucose) within our blood.,
"we then need enough insulin to either convert the blood sugar into energy for our body, or to store the blood sugar as body fat.",
"if the amount of carbohydrate we take in is more than our bodys own (or injected) insulin can cope with, then our blood sugar will rise.",
"the bad news research indicates that raised blood sugar levels over a period of years can lead to organ damage, commonly referred to as diabetic complications .",
the good news people on the forum here have shown that there is plenty of opportunity to keep blood sugar levels from going too high.,
its a daily task but its within our reach and its well worth the effort.,
"controlling your carbs the info below is primarily aimed at people with type 2 diabetes, however, it may also be of benefit for other types of diabetes as well.",
there are two approaches to controlling your carbs: reduce your carbohydrate intake choose better carbohydrates reduce your carbohydrates a large number of people on this forum have chosen to reduce the amount of carbohydrates they eat as they have found this to be an effective way of improving (lowering) their blood sugar levels.,
"the carbohydrates which tend to have the most pronounced effect on blood sugar levels tend to be starchy carbohydrates such as rice, pasta, bread, potatoes and similar root vegetables, flour based products (pastry, cakes, biscuits, battered food etc) and certain fruits.",
choosing better carbohydrates the low glycaemic index diet is often favoured by healthcare professionals but some people with diabetes find that low gi does not help their blood sugar enough and may wish to cut out these foods altogether.,
read more on carbohydrates and diabetes .,
"over 145,000 people have taken part in the low carb program - a free 10 week structured education course that is helping people lose weight and reduce medication dependency by explaining the science behind carbs, insulin and gi.",
eating what works for you different people respond differently to different types of food.,
what works for one person may not work so well for another.,
the best way to see which foods are working for you is to test your blood sugar with a glucose meter.,
to be able to see what effect a particular type of food or meal has on your blood sugar is to do a test before the meal and then test after the meal.,
a test 2 hours after the meal gives a good idea of how your body has reacted to the meal.,
"the blood sugar ranges recommended by nice are as follows: blood glucose ranges for type 2 diabetes before meals: 4 to 7 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 8.5 mmol/l blood glucose ranges for type 1 diabetes (adults) before meals: 4 to 7 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 9 mmol/l blood glucose ranges for type 1 diabetes (children) before meals: 4 to 8 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 10 mmol/l however, those that are able to, may wish to keep blood sugar levels below the nice after meal targets.",
"access to blood glucose test strips the nice guidelines suggest that people newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes should be offered: structured education to every person and/or their carer at and around the time of diagnosis, with annual reinforcement and review self-monitoring of plasma glucose to a person newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes only as an integral part of his or her self-management education therefore both structured education and self-monitoring of blood glucose should be offered to people with type 2 diabetes.",

"it is a gradual, weekly, programme of progressive change.",
"click to expand... @pipp not really following the steps, but i did reduced my carb substantially to 150g-200g/day, cut down by 50%.",
"i have much to learn from you in reversal of diabetes, but i heard that it is mainly suitable for patients with 10 year or less, so i am not so sure if the low carb program can help me or not, but i am determined to find out.",
"i am very keen to learn from patients with long history, and how they are practising the low carb program.",
"thanks btw, my h1a1c 10 % bluetit1802 said: hi, very well done on that tremendous weight loss!",
that is brilliant.,
"as the others have said, metformin accumulates in your body and works on the liver to help a little with insulin resistance and to reduce the amount of natural glucose the liver produces, although only to a limited extent.",
it isn't related to your food intake at all.,
the only reason you are told to take it before meals is to stop you feeling sick with stomach problems.,
"i also agree with @pipp that your hba1c is too high and needs bringing down, but you obviously know this or you wouldn't be asking for help.",
i wonder if we can help you with your food?,
perhaps tell us what you typically eat in a day and we may spot something that could help.,
"click to expand... @bluetit thanks for your encouragement my last hba1c was too high, it was because i stopped my metformin without monitoring my bg level for a few months .",
"i reduced my carb to 150-200g daily( bread, rice or noodle), 2 -3 mid size fruits, like banana/orange, moderate amount of meat such as fish, beef or pork, and moderate amount of veg, 1 -2 fried eggs, 1-2 glasses of milk, 80 - 100 g peanut butter, etc.",
"i don't eat much sugar, no ice cream, no cake, no soft drinks, no coke since diagnosed.",
roughly my daily carolies are around 1500 - 1800.,
"btw, i have never been overweighting, bmi 21, was 25 a few years ago.",
"i did not test my bg level for different food, not very sure how to do it unless for a meal i only take one kind of food, even then not sure how much i should eat to make sense.",
also not sure if i need to the testing without taking metformin or not.,
hopefully with the helps from you and many others of this forum i can be successful in reversal of my diabetes.,
bluetit1802 said: you test immediately before you eat your meal.,
then you test again 2 hours after your first bite.,
look at the rise from before to after.,
the only items in that meal that will have caused that rise are the carbs.,
the fats and proteins don't do this.,
keep a food diary including portion sizes and record your levels alongside.,
you will soon see patterns emerging and be able to seriously reduce the carb elements or eliminate some completely.,
"at the risk of sounding very harsh, 150g carbs is the maximum amount to be considered low carb, and is a very difficult amount for our bodies to cope with.",
"i suggest your high levels are due to bread, rice, noodles, bananas and oranges, plus milk.",
all these are very high in sugar and carbs.,
"if you cut out those particular carbs and stick to meat, fish, salads, vegetables (not root veg) and fats your levels will improve.",
have a look at this https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/60-seconds which gives lists of good foods and foods to avoid.,
you will find it useful.,
"click to expand... @bluetit thanks for explaining how to do food testing with bg level, hopefully i will see patterns emerging as i mentioned i did not follow the low carb program, this is because no need to lose weight for me, my objectives are 1. make my bg level normal without taking metformin, but with right diet and excise; 2. reverse my diabetes of 20 years; i will do my testing and hopefully find out what food can cause high bg, then see if i need to cut down daily carb to under 100g.",

i will try that another day and test.,
this kebab house didn't do anything as healthy as that - it was strictly heart attack on a plate all the way!,

hi my husband has had type 1 diabetes for 55 years.,
he is normally quite well but last week he developed really bad eczema all over his body except his face and neck.,
he had real trouble keeping his blood sugars down but they are under control again now that the rash is clearing up.,
we are obviously looking for possible causes and i wondered if anyone knows if this is common in diabetics or has any ideas how he can manage both conditions together.,
"many thanks pip thank you so much everyone for your comments, i have looked at the suggested site and particularly what it says about seborrhoeic eczema.",
"as suggested there, the worst parts were the groin and armpits and these were the first places to be affected.",
our doctor did not recognize it as eczema and was treating him for other problems for a week before he saw a skin specialist within the practice.,
by that time it was almost everywhere and weeping badly.,
he now also has what appears to be dyshidrotic excema on his feet (like friction blisters).,
the skin specialist (who was brilliant!),
"prescribed dermovate-nn cream, atarax tablets, double base shower gel and double base moisturiser (friday evening).",
"his skin improved massively straight away and it appears now to be just a case of healing, although new blisters keep appearing on his feet.",
it was really useful also to hear about seborrhoeic eczema and high bg levels.,
the night before the rash he was shivering but very hot to the touch and had cold-like symptoms so i wonder if his sugars were high (he can't remeber off hand).,
his sugars have been very high all this week though.,
"many, many thanks everyone.",
i really feel we are getting a bit closer to stopping it happening again.,
i will keep you posted on what happens.,
pip,
"anonymous question submitted: i've been type 1 diabetic for 32 years , why did eli lilly stop producing pork insulin when it worked , controlled diabetes so much better!",
"my problems are the cloudy feeling, unknown lows, vision problems, very painful joint pain known and tested to be caused by human insulin.",
"to submit a question, please go to http://www.diabetes.co.uk/ask-an-anonymous-question.html",
i have been type 2 for about 6 years well controlled on metformin until i was put on steroids about 3 years ago.,
this caused my bs to go sky high and i was started on insulin.,
the steroids and insulin caused weight gain and even after i was weaned off steroids my bs remained high.,
i started to low carb in january this year and lost two and a half stone.,
i went for my yearly blood tests which although showed i was in the non diabetic range also showed anaemia.,
"to cut a long story short this set off lots of blood tests, gastroscopy and colonoscopy and a referral to a haematologist who requested a liver scan.",
the scan showed an enlarged spleen with varices and cirrhosis of the liver.,
since all this i have struggled to lose weight although my legs are getting thinner due to muscle loss but the enlarged spleen and liver means that my tummy is still big.,
i am still trying to low carb as much as i can but the cirrhosis makes it difficult for the liver to convert protein into energy which is why many cirrhosis patients are mal nourished.,
they recommend several small meals a day and a high carb snack before bed.,
this is obviously counter intuative to the low carb diet.,
i am going to ask for a referral to a dietician when i next see the consultant...but god knows when that will be.,
any advice welcome.,
deb,
"just returned from diabetic review, very pleased apart from nurse saying as on gliclazide must inform dvla and car insurance phoned both and told does't matter not sure what is right looked on gov.uk not very helpful any one got any info",
do you ever let yourself indulge in something you really enjoyed before diabetes but have now given up.,
i do sometimes give myself a naughty treat but it is not very often anything sweet.... never did have much of a sweet tooth.,
last week though it was something sweet in the form of caramel and sesame seed coated peanuts they were so yummy and i did have to be very firm with myself and not eat the whole bag i don't find eating something like that makes me want more though.,
"some people say they crave starchy carbs but i did not eat very much of those anyway well not bread pasta or rice but i do miss a jacket potato as i did eat a lot of those so i will have one of those occasionally noblehead said: don't particularly miss sweet stuff but i'm partial to a savory snack from time to time, xl cheese crisps are my favourite followed by a nice meat pie, preferably a scotch pie click to expand... lovely alaska said: i'll occasionally have something sweeter (milk chocolate or a dessert) than normal.",
the challenge is then to ensure it stays a treat and doesn't slip into being a habit.,
i used to love desserts but now they're now only an occasional (once a month) occurrence.,
"i have chocolate every day, but because it's 85% dark chocolate (and i don't crazy with it) it's no trouble for my sugar levels.",
click to expand...,
yes that is the only chocolate i have not every day though just when i think of it.,
"i always did prefer dark chocolate if i had any at all noblehead said: yep, your right i'm a type 1 and bolus for food it may have escaped your attention zand but annie has posted a little of what you fancy in the ask a question section of the forum, i'm sure if she only wanted replies from type 2's she would have said, annie asked in the opening sentence: ''do you ever let yourself indulge in something you really enjoyed before diabetes but have now given up'' to which i replied, so if you have nothing to add to the thread better to stay out of it then quote other members posts.",
"regards click to expand... to be fair, there is nothing in your signature or restricted profile to suggest that you are type 1.",
my concern would be that a newly diagnosed type 2 might read your post and think that crisps and pastry pies are a good idea for a treat,

at the moment i am a diet controlled type 2 diabetic and have only been dx for a few months.,
"my question is this, i have been monitoring my blood glucose myself, my before readings vary between 6.1 and 8.3 and after meals my readings are between 8.3 and 9.6.",
do these readings seem a little on the high side and do i need to report these figures to my diabetic nurse?,
marina xxx thank you for the quick reply synonym.,
"i am very strict with my diet and have cut out all sugar, saturated fat and am following lo carb and not sure what else to cut down on.",
i am on no medication at the moment and wondered if i needed to be on any.,
"marina x hi dragongirl, well as i said i have cut out sugar and use sweeteners, also have no potatoes except on a sunday when i will treat myself to 2 small roast ones.",
"have cut out wheat and replaced pasta and bread with rice, rice cakes.",
a typical day for me would be cornflakes with semi skimmed milk and sweetener.,
lunch would be rice cakes with some sort of topping or soup made with loads of veg.,
"then say, if i were to make a cottage pie for my husband and daughter for tea i would put some of the mince in a small dish then would top the larger one for hubby and daughter with mashed potatoes and would top mine with mashed swede.",
basically all i do is replace potatoes in a meal with loads of veg.,
"don't get me wrong i do sometimes slip of the waggon if i'm making chips for hubby, once in a while i will have a small amount but that's only once a fortnight or so and they are always, always lo fat oven chips.",
"marina x hi synonym, i never thought about, sweeteners and rice and cornflakes, i really thought i was doing the right thing changing to them, just shows how confusing this condition is.",
"mind you reading many of the other posts my bg levels are low in comparision to many on here, don't think i have anything to worry about!",
"marina xx yes, i am synonym and i've done some random testing also.",
"i am trying very hard with my diet, i have a number of health problems, one of which is very serious, so am very keen to continue fighting the condition without resorting to medication.",
"marina xx you're right ardberg, breakfast is the worst time for me, i can never seem to get it right.",
i love eggs but try not to have too many because of cholestrol and i can't have grapefruit (my favourite) because something in grapefruit stops my medication from working properly.,
i love porridge so am going to have to stick to that or homemade yoghurt.,
it does make sense that if i get my breakfasts right then hopefully my bg will be stable for the rest of the day thank you everyone for your excellent advice.,

i do genuinely have concerns about people drinking just to manage bgs though.,
"'spose there's not much difference in end result compared to me drinking because i like it, but alcohol just for medication needs thinking about.",
need to remember the weight issues as well.,

"hi not diagnosed, been having symptoms of diabetes for some time, lost 21 lbs in a few months, very tired, thirsty, urinating constantly, especially at night and very sweaty and hot all the time.",
i have noticed recently that when i drink my beloved lucozade though that i start feeling absolutely terrible a while later.,
"i had a pint of orange lucozade in the late afternoon and by this evening i was collapsed on the couch, heart racing, sweat blasting out of me, shaking, boiling hot and feeling horrifically ill and very agitated.",
"when this was happening before, i put it down to an infection or just doing too much and sort of ignored it, but it's happening more and more now, especially after sweet drinks or chocolates.",
"i've done nothing but shovelling food in for a few months in a bid to regain weight, to no avail, even with high cal, high fat foods, weight gain shakes, litres of lucozade, etc.",
"again, i put the night time pee'ing down to some sort of bug and expected it to go away in due course.",
any ideas what this terrible feeling could be after a glass of lucozade?,
"that feeling that is coming on after glasses of sweet drinks, where i have to sit down and feel shaky and sweaty and ill, is that a symptom of diabetes?",
"i had that feeling a few hours after the lucozade and just before it got really bad, had just made a bowl of salmon and pasta and a while after eating that, i felt better.",
is it possible that even after the lucozade (which surely should have raised my bg ) that i could swing low again?,
i don't know the difference between too high sugar symptoms and too low.,
"sorry for all the questions, just very, very confused!",
"hi again, thanks for the replies.",
i should clarify that i am not seeking a diagnosis here.,
"i was simply asking what kind of symptoms do actually happen when high or low sugar situations occur, to see if i can, myself, spot any trends or patterns around what symptoms i get and when and any correlation with my foods and exercise, etc.",
"so, for clarity: what are the symptoms of low sugar?",
what are the symptoms of high sugar?,
"can blood sugar swings up and down cause symptoms and if so, what kind of symptoms?",
any information appreciated.,
some of these symptoms were already under investigation but i was sent to the wrong kind of consultant in the past and the whole thing grossly mismanaged.,
i need further supporting evidence of exactly what triggers the intermittent part of the symptoms.,
"accordingly, there are substantive and complicated reasons why i have not gone to my gp as yet, however naturally in the fullness of time, i will obtain a medical opinion.",
"i am in my 30s so unlikely to be type 1, however of course not impossible.",
"obviously if matters were to worsen, i would seek immediate medical advice, however in the meantime i do need to track things partially because there has been a long standing dispute between multiple consultants and gps in regards to medical matters.",
"technically, i believe that i need to see an endocrinologist but i am being bounced between two other medical specialities, with neither party taking any ownership for progressing investigations.",
"please, instead of lectures, i just need the information i have asked for.",
"i'm having my first fasting blood test tomorrow, three months after starting metformin.",
"but the thing is, isn't it dangerous to fast and take metformin?",
"the drug is supposed to lower the blood sugar but if you don't eat, won't it get dangerously low in those 12 hours of no food?",
miss the food safely or miss the drug?,
"thanks for the replies, people.",
another thing has occured to me now; perhaps i don't need to fast for the test... my diabetic nurse has a bit of a habit of skimming over the details.,
i'm sure i must have just assumed it was a fasting test again.,
thanks for that 2131.,
"if it's common practice for 3 or 6 monhtly tests to be done fasting, then i'll assume the same is for me.",
i've just taken my evening metformin at 8pm and will have my test around 8am tomorrow morning.,

almost two years ago i successfully managed to 'quit the weed' and gave up smoking after almost 35 years (i've been type 1 on insulin for about the same length of time).,
whilst it may be a case of swapping one bad habit for another i am still getting my 'fix' via e-cigs (a highly recommended aid to quitting the ciggies as far as i'm concerned).,
having started with tobacco flavours of 'juice' / e-liquid i have recently started to 'vape' other flavours such as apple and banana.,
"my glucose levels have not been too clever recently and, whilst there may be other factors, i wondered if my vaping habit may be having a detrimental effect on my control.",
the docs at my diabetic clinic this morning pleaded ignorance to the whole thing and could only suggest i gave it up!,
i wondered if there are any fellow vapers out there who may have noted any effects on their glucose levels :?,

"its been a good & bad day for me today,good in the sense that i visited my big sister & surprised her with a completely sugar free birthday cake which my best friend made for me especially.bad in the sense that my neuropathic pains were really bad today & both my feet were so painful.thank fully my carer massaged my feet to ease the pain which helped tremendously.also at lunch time i realised that had forgotten to take my pen injection so as i really couldn't do anything about it the day just carried on as normal although i was very careful as to not eat unessasarily except at 3pm when my sister has her snack when i presented her with the sugar free birthday cake.anyway when i came back home the first thing that i did was to check my blood sugar level which was 27.4 i put on 22 units of insulin on & didn't eat anything as i was feeling slightly sick so before bedtime i tested again & my level was 7.9 so before finally going to sleep i had a glass of milk & a mini biscuit then went to sleep,during the night i woke up feeling unwell so tested my blood sugar level & it was 3.0 i had a medium sized glass of lucozade & went back to bed.i tested my blood level this morning & it was 9.7.",

"friday at college, my lecturer decided to bring in some marshmallows & other sweets for everyone.",
"then went to me ""your not allowed any as you are a diabetic.""",
i actually felt really offended by what she said.,
i actually feel inclined to make that decision and adjust my own insulin dose to counteract the god knows how much sugar there are in them.,
if i have a hyper or hypo from them that is my own fault.,
i actually feel like i should make a complaint against her to the college as it really upset me and things don't normally do.,
am i over reacting?,
"i will chat to her tomorrow and if she is being ignorant and not listening, a full formal complaint will go in.",
i really do not like being reminded i had diabetes every single day.,
i don't want to be suing as there is too much paper work.,
"i know as i am in the process of it from when i was knocked off my motorbike when i was waiting at a roundabout i am not entirely sure, either i was having a day where stupid things where going to get to me or what.",
"i will have a quiet word though as i don't feel instantly going all guns blazing to management should be the first thing hopefully she will understand that it upset me and that she will think about what she is saying next time i had a quiet word with her today, unfortunately did not go very well she was like ""i have family who are diabetic and they are not allowed sweets or sugary things at all"" and wouldn't listen to me at all even when i said, i am able to adjust my insulin doses to what i have eaten and announced this all out to the rest of the class well looks like i will have to make a formal complaint as she is was completely rude and non caring.",
considering this is a health & social care course this is completely the behaviour i would not expect from someone.,
no wonder i don't like other human beings i am just after an apology & just make sure that she thinks before she speaks.,
i am not in the mood to sue as 1. too much paperwork 2. silly thing to be suing about.,
apology just needed hopefully the college will take this seriously,
i was hospitalized after an extreme hypoglycemic incident last friday.,
it occurred a few minutes after dosing 13 units of toujeo and quickly led to unconsciousness.,
we're not sure how long i was out but my apple watch showed little/no movement for around an hour.,
when i was up i had no idea where i was (or who i was!),
my wife found me standing in our kids bathroom with puddles of sweat around me.,
"needless to say, the whole experience was terrifying.",
"doctors are baffled, said i'd need 7-10 times that dose to achieve that result and would have been easily noticed.",
they don't believe the solution became concentrated either since the new formulas prevent that (or do they.),
"at any rate, i'm saving the pen for analysis if needed and getting a cgm!",
some background on me: i was diagnosed lada 5 years ago and was diet/exercise controlled till last december when i began using toujeo.,
i'm very fit and eat a low carb balanced diet.,
my previous levels have been between 80-110 mg/dl on a regular basis (for most of the past year.),
anyone with similar experiences or insight i'd love to hear from you.,
thanks from a now extremely paranoid type 1.5 j thanks.,
looks like a cgm and a switch to levemir are in my future.,
i'm in the us so not sure that yellow card website is something i should file on.,
my dr. is filing an incident report (who knows what that's for) so we'll see.,
13 units doesn't seem like enough to take me from 90-100 to < 20mg/dl in under 10 minutes even if i shot it directly into a vein but perhaps i'm incorrect.,
i couldn't find a calculator to determine it.,

can anyone advise please.x thankyou thankyou to everyone who took the time to reply to my post.,
xxxx geofferstaylor said: isn't diclofenac being withdrawn generally?,
i have it as a standby for gout attacks (not had one in many months) but my gp is going to change the prescription and in any case it was difficult to get hold of last time i renewed my supply.,

over the last week i have notice a urine like smell on my body (even after my daily shower).,
i do have 'ops' moments and wear pads which i change through out the day so thought they might be the smell source.,
but i don't think it is that.,
i also still have hot flushes a couple of times a day and hot weather doesn't help.,
i think i have a general body odour now.,
on separate occasions different friends have commented.,
saying oh it smells like a cat has ****** in here and there is a real fish smell.,

thinking of seeing if anyone on this the forum is doing the newcastle diet or similar fasting weight control.,
saw the doctor and he said my blood test from my last diabetic check has gone up from 7.5 to 8.7.,
i have had my mum visiting for the last two months and not getting the walks in i usually do so he says to see how it goes now i am back to walking more.,
re smell he said as the other tests where ok it will not be medical.,

on my most recent hba1c test i have come out with a level of 32.,
"given this is normal for someone without diabetes, but lower than normal for someone with diabetes, i am unclear whether it should be regarded as on the low side and potentially of concern, or should be regarded as safe and normal.",
can anyone please advise?,
"i was moved from gliclazide and metformin onto alogliptin last year, mainly because of the hypos i'd been experiencing.",
"however, since then i've also been doing slimming world and have lost over 2 stone, so it's hard to be sure whether it's the change in medication or the weight loss that is primarily contributing to the reduced hba1c level.",
"i went to see my gp recently due to feeling energyless and, for the first time since i changed my medication, experiencing a hypo.",
"my hba1c result in my annual review a couple of months before had been 32, which my gp practice said was normal when i rang for the results.",
"however, given the above symptoms, i went to see my gp a couple of weeks ago.",
"he said that a level of 48 would be normal for diabetes and arranged a further hba1c test, saying he would review the medication if it was 32 again.",
"it was 32, but when i rang the practice for the result, they are insisting that 32 is normal, so i'm confused.",
just to update on the outcome of this.,
"on the back of my result being a score of 32, ny gp arranged a second hba1c test and said he would adjust my medication downwards if it came out at a similar level.",
"when i rang my gp practice for the result, i was told it was 'normal' and i had to ask for the specific score.",
it was 32 but they advised again that their system said this was normal.,
"when i said that ny gp had already said he would adjust my medication if it was 32, i was asked to ring again when another colleague was in.",
"again they said it was showing as normal but, when i advised of my previous discussion wiyh my gp and that 32 for someone with diabetes could include variation lower and higher, they arranged for my gp to ring me.",
"after discussing it with him he has adjusted my medication from 2x alogliptin per day to 1 x metformin per day, and for me to be retested in december to check the effects.",
"i'm fine with this outcome, but it does demonstrate how someone could be badly advised if they just accepted that their gp practice said their result was 'normal'.",
bluetit1802 said: presumably it was a receptionist telling you that 32 is normal.,
"it is normal, so she was correct.",
"the computer would have ""normal"" written alongside the score.",
the receptionist would have no idea that it is the medication causing this and that you needed to speak to a doctor.,
"once you pushed the matter, they arranged for you to speak to your doctor - and hey presto, you got good advice.",
click to expand...,
"yes it was a receptionist i originally spoke to, and i don't blame her for simply reading the interpretation that the system gave to the score.",
"what does concern me is, if a score of 32 may or may not be normal for someone with diabetes, why the system flags it purely as 'normal' rather than adding prompts for further enquiry.",
someone a bit less assertive would potentially have walked away after the first call without knowing they had a possible issue.,
ringi said: sometimes you have to go and sit in a room with a gp to get them to engage their brain when looking at test results.,
"most test results are looked at by whatever gp is checking reuslts on the day, and they have many to look at, so will not look at someone's nodes if the result is ""normal"".",

but in this case i'm not sure whether a gp had actually reviewed the result before my first call.,
"the advice at the end of my first call was to ring back to speak to the 'results team' but this turned out to someone else from the practice staff rather than a gp, and even they initially referred to the 'normal' statement for the score, so i was left wondering whether it was simply a computerised system giving a standard interpretation to a 32 score.",

"hi anna, i've never heard of flyflots so i will certainly look them up, i do agree about looking after your feet, i use gehwol fusscraft (i may have spelt that wrong) it is the most amazing cream, my chiropodist recommended it, i use the mint version, it is wonderful and seems to have an ongoing effect, my feet used to burn at the end of the day, but now they don't, i use it twice a day, it is cooling, soothing and moisturising, i remember my teens and early twenties when i used to cram my feet into towering stilletos, if i could go back and give my younger self one piece of advice it would be ""get into flats!!!!",
"lol, thanks vivienne, i have requested a hotter catalogue, can't wait, i have looked on line too and they do look really good.",
"hi, i've been reading quite a lot about the much hyped newcastle diet.",
the basis of this diet is that by reducing the fat in your liver/pancreas you can increase insulin sensitivity again.,
hoo rah!,
the average weight loss on the 8 week diet is around 15kg.,
what i don't understand is if i lost this weight on a more conventional diet why wouldn't the fat in my liver/pancreas decrease by the same amount?,
is there somethiing specific in the intensity of the newcastle diet that means the liver and pancreas fat is reduced further than by conventional diets?,
thanking you in advance for your answers.,
warren thanks for your responses.,
pipp said: hi @warrenb there are a few forum members who have been successful newcastle dieters.,
i am one.,
"many more members advocate the low carb high fat, method.",
"i can only speak from personal experience, and would never try to discredit anyone else's chosen diet, or suggest my way was the only way.",
"for me, the newcastle diet did, indeed, have the effect of getting my blood glucose back into non-diabetic levels very rapidly, and i have remained that way now for 3 years.",
i think it was the vast reduction of calorie intake that sorted my pancreas and liver fat.,
"i had not been able to do this any other way, and had tried many different eating plans before.",
"the newcastle diet was devised to mimic the response after bariatric surgery, as it had been observed that patients having this surgery very quickly had normal bg readings.",
the hypothesis was that it was the drastic reduction in the amount of food consumed that caused this change.,
"for me, newcastle diet was a preferable option to surgery.",
"it seems to have worked for me, so far.",
hope this helps answer your question.,
"click to expand... hi pipp, thanks for detailing your own experience.",
"its great to think we're not necessarily destined to walk the diabetes road and that with some hard work we can regain some, if not all, control of our bodies again!",
may i ask how long you were diabetic before trying the diet?,
"kind regards warren pipp said: yes, i had been diagnosed 6 years before i started.",
i weighed 144 kg.,
"i had been trying to lose weight following nhs guidelines, but only managed to get 7kg off in 3years before newcastle diet.",

welldone for getting your blood sugars under control!,
thanks for your reply.,
"hello all, sorry if i've emailed a question about fatty liver before but i just can't help feeling that i should be more concerned about this than i am.",
"i was diagnosed (by chance) with fatty liver 2 years ago, when i thought at the time i had gallstones.",
i am also a t2 and apparently this can go hand in hand with diabetes.,
"basically, i was just 'sent away' by my gp and he said to change my lifestyle (easier said than done).",
"i am trying so hard to lose weight as i know how important it is for my health (i am classed obese) but my concern about fatty liver is a) i have no idea how long i've had it - could be years the gp said and b) more concerning, how much damage (if any) has it done to my liver.",
i do have lft's (liver function tests) on an annual basis but are these sufficient enough to inform me (and the gp) that there is nothing to worry about?,
i'm not sure what to do.,
i have asked to go on the gp referral scheme and am waiting to be contacted by them.,
"basically, this will allow me to use a local gym for 12 weeks and i should get dietary advice along the way so i am hoping this will kick start me off to a healthier lifestyle as i have tried everything you can think of to lose weight.",
"my lft's have been ok up to now and all numbers within range but i do get a discomfort under my right rib and radiating over to my right shoulder blade and this sometimes varies, sometimes it's more uncomfortable than other times.",
"i seem to hit the low points when it's festivities ie christmas, easter, birthdays etc there always seems to be something coming up which throws me right off track - it is all so very hard but i do know that i need to do this for my health.",
does anyone know what other tests there are apart from a fibroscan (expensive) to detect how much damage done to the liver?,
ie any other blood tests i could ask my gp for?,
i doubt they will let me have a fibroscan as i hear they are very expensive - about 200+ but i wondered if there are any other significant blood tests for example i could ask for?,
"thanks johnnyxs said: that sounds like the classic symptoms of a gall bladder problem.... http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gallstones/pages/symptoms.aspx if it were me i think i'd ask my doctor for a referral for an upper abdomen ultra sound scan of liver , gall bladder , pancreas and bile duct click to expand...",
thanks for your reply johnny but i did have an ultrasound scan in 2015 after i complained to my gp of my discomfort underneath my right rib but they found my gall bladder and pancreas was ok but they did find a liver cyst along with fatty liver.,
after my liver cyst was investigated further with mri etc they ruled out anything sinister so all i can assume really is that it may either be my liver cyst playing up or the fatty liver.,
might be worth me making an appointment to speak with a gp about my concerns although i am always going to the doctors and am beginning to feel a bit of a nuisance.,
"i have so many other health issues, it's not just one thing, i also have a hiatus hernia.",
i'm pretty sure most of my symptoms are due to my weight that is why i'm so desperate to have some decent weight loss.,
"i rang the british liver trust yesterday and spoke with a really nice lady about my concerns and she has suggested that i ask my gp if he can tell me from my us scan 2 years ago, how much fat i have in my liver and ask for another scan to see whether things have changed.",
she said this is becoming an epidemic and people not realising they have fatty liver unless it's picked up by chance (like in my case).,
i think doctors should send diabetics for a liver scan once they are diagnosed with diabetes as a matter of routine but i guess this isn't done due to costs.,
"gp's should also highlight this more and explain things in more detail when you are diagnosed with diabetes, it just seems to me once you are diagnosed they just send you on your way and leave it in your hands to do something about it but don't highlight how important it is to change lifestyle.",
are there any others who feel as angry as i do at the moment?,
well i saw my gp this week and aired my concerns with fatty liver and asked questions.,
basically he told me not to get too concerned about it and watch my diet and go low fat and he said that liver function tests are enough to keep a check on things and because mine have always com back ok i should not worry.,
"well that's that i suppose i can't do anymore, just down to me i guess.",
thanks for listening.,

"hi folks, not been on for a while, but now i am back with a question.... my son is 16 next month and is type 1, i sent off to the dvla for his provisional last month, so he can get a 50cc scooter.",
on the application form the second option down was to apply for a provisional to drive a car at 16 !,
"i phoned dvla to find out what that was about as i thought you has to be 17 for a car, they told me that if he has a medical condition and get the higher rate of mobility, then yes he can apply for the car licence at 16, so i applied for it for him and send off the letters of proof they asked for.",
"then this morning his first ever provisional arrived by post, he has been given the 50cc scooter licence and the car to drive at 16. so now i can start giving him lessons (well next month on his 16th birthday anyway) so my question is, has anyone else done this for their child and what insurance company did you use to get insurance on his own car in his own name ?",
this is for a bog standard car with no modifications.,
"regards eliminator thanks for the replies, but it's not driving lessons i am looking for, as i have taught people to drive for years.",
even my wife passed first time with me teaching her lol.,
my son does not have the 3 years left to get a mobility car with the free insurance and all that.,
"that is why i am looking for an insurance company that will insure a 16yr old in his own car, i also then want to put my 20yr old daughters name on the policy as a named driver, that way they can share the car, costs and i can teach them both.",
but i am finding it had to find any insurance company to insure him.,
"i thought i would ask on here are more pairs of eyes searching the internet, surely someone will spot a company somewere.",
"thanks eliminator i did check the start dates and they are valid for the day after this 16th birthday for both 50cc scooter and car, tractor, and some other kind i vehicle too, i can't check as he has gone away for the weekend.",
"i still have not found an insurance company that will insure him, but he did find a driving school that will teach him to drive, in fact they are starting him on tuesday while he is still 15, but only on private roads, as the instructor has told us that it is perfectly legal to take driving lessons at 15yrs old on private land.",
"hello, last night i ate spaghetti.",
i had alot of cheese and meat on top.,
after 2 hours my blood glucose was pretty good.,
"around 7mmol after injecting 1,5unit novo rapid.",
but 3-7 hours later my blood glucose exploded.,
what causes this?,
"spaghetti, the cheese or the meat?",
or is it the combination of spaghetti combined with fat?,
"im trying to gain weight, so i dont want to cut down on carbs and fat any tips on how i could avoid this bg spike?",
"best regards thomas yeah, i eat alot.",
but i am also extremly insulin sensitive.,
"i injected 1,5units 30min after i had finished eating.",
"my blood glucose was back to normal after 2 hours, but spiked just after 2 hours.",
if i had injected more i would have gone low before 2 hour.,
very very interesting article you got there phoenix!,
"there must be quite a few people who, like myself, have had their gall bladder removed.",
this was nearly 4 years ago.,
then last october i was diagnosed t2 diabetic.,
"now before i was diagnosed there were certain foods i could not eat as they sent me scurrying to the loo within half an hour, and if i didn't eat within an hour of getting up it was the same scenario.",
"since diagnosis i can once again eat certain food without doing the boston quick step, however the metformin in the morning would make me qualify for the olympic 100 yard dash.",
so i have to time when i eat to when i want to go out as i can't go anywhere for about an hour.,
"i don't know if this is purely down to the metformin or a combination of that and minus a gall bladder, and would the absence of said gall bladder have any effect on my bs readings?",
just a thought as my liver is now dripping bile constantly into my digestive system.,
"catherinecherub said: hi @killerkaz , this article should help.",
"when the gallbladder is removed, bile made by the liver can no longer be stored between meals.",
"instead, the bile flows directly into the intestine anytime the liver produces it.",
"thus, there still is bile in the intestine to mix with food and fat.",
"it is true that there is not as much bile, but there is enough to allow the digestion and transfer of fat.",
people who have had their gallbladders removed do not need to limit the fat in their diet.,
the only clear side effect of removal of the gallbladder is diarrhea .,
this occurs in about 10% of patients.,
the diarrhea occurs because of the change in the way bile is delivered to the intestine once the gallbladder has been removed.,
bile and the way it is delivered to the intestine appears to control the speed with which food passes through the intestine.,
removing the gallbladder speeds up the passage of food and thereby may cause the diarrhea.,
there may be other reasons why the change in delivery of bile causes diarrhea as well.,
http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15984 it could be a combination of both the lack of gall bladder plus the metformin.,
have you asked your g.p.,
if you can have the slow release one?,
that might help.,
i'll bump your post up as someone might be going through the same as you.,

"tng1971 said: hi, i had my gall bladder removed 7 years ago and was diagnosed as t2 18 months ago.",
"my gp put me on metformin, which i perservered with for 8 months and the side affects that came with it, mainly the diarrhoea.",

"thanks i should have thought of that, i worked in farm supply's years ago and we all used the udder cream as hand cream lol therower said: hi @lynmi .",

as said rotate you fingers.,
ensure your finger pricker is set correctly ( no use drilling for oil when all you need is to plant some seedlings) warm/ wash your hands prior to testing.,
moisturise with cream ( cocoa butter i find good ).,
purchase a pumice stone to remove hard skin on a regular basis.,
change your lancet on a regular basis.,

i though this might have been low blood pressure but have tested repeatedly both sitting and standing and each time it falls within the ideal range.,
"i saw my gp over this and she said it was dehydration, but i drink water at the recommended levels, don't have dry mouth or dark urine so am at a loss as to what is causing this, any ideas guys.",

"thanks guys for replying and sharing your experiences, in relation to the weight loss as soon as my gp told me i had type 2 i stopped, the sweets, cakes, biscuits, chocolate, fizzy drinks and sugar in my tea and on breakfast cereal.",
"i eat a lot more fruit, have adopted porridge as my breakfast of choice, cut back on the portion sizes and the fast food and ready meals.",
i still eat what i like just in moderation which is what the x-pert diabetes course i attended recommended rather than deny yourself these things.,
the weight fell off rapidly in the first two months and then continued at a gradual pace i am still losing weight but just a couple of pounds over 2 weeks or so.,
"i reckon i'll plateau soon, so time to put some exercise in the mix.",

hi i was just wondering does anyone else suffer from a runny nose?i know that it sounds a bit childish but since i was diagnosed i feel that nearly every day since at some stage i get a runny nose.it isnt fussy either.it will appear indoors and outdoors and can appear very suddenly.it can get a bit embarassing at times.the only medication i take is metformin.i dont recall this being a side effect.,
thanks for reading dermot thanks a million catherine after reading the other side effects i suppose a runny nose isnt the worse.,

my daughter has diabetes insipidus she is currently 6 but the size of an 8 yr old and her medication enables her to be dry in the day with help ie staying close to the tiolet and allowing her to drop all and run.,
but at night she has to wear drynites and gets through anything up to 3 a night if she wakes or a wet bed if she doesn't and the drynite floods or splits open.,
i would like to know when she grows out of drynites is there another larger product we can buy for her that is a pull up type not a nappy type.,
also i have spoken to tena lady but they don't do small sized pads that hold large quantities of water they only have small sized pads suitable for dribbles.i have found suitable pull ups in adult sizes but nothing in between.,
any help would be appreciated as she has refused to wear the nappy style as she says she is not a baby and doesn't want me to have to get her into it.,
she likes to do the pullups on her own.,
thankyou everyone for your replies.,

yes her consultant is an endocrinologist and she sees him every 3-4 months as a rule but she last saw him friday and is going back in 6 weeks for another scan.,
"she is prescribed ditrapan twice daily and desmopressin melts for night time, she has been on these for 2 years.",

i have been taking metformin for a month and have been on the full dose (500mg x3 daily) for over a week and i'm not a happy bunny.,
i'm having mild acid reflux and indigestion every day and i'm feeling bloated and burpy.,
this has been going on for the last week or so.,
i also have spots on my nose.,
this is the most distressing symptom for me.,
"i have rosaeca, which means that i have red flushing on my nose and left cheek, with regular outbreaks of pustules.",
"red background and yellow pustules, not a fashion statement and yes it was very noticable before i started using a cream called rosex, (a long term treatment) prescribed by the dermatologist in july.",
i know my nose was noticable as i was often asked if i had a cold by colleagues or why my nose was red by some of my more neurlogically disinhibited clients.,
although my dermatologist said it was very mild.,
"but it is back - my nose is reddening again and this week i had a crop of yellow spots :cry: i have tracked down the metformin side effects and see that flushing, rashes and skin reddening is something of an issue for some people, although rare.",
"i may be one of them :cry: i'm going to have a chat with the pharmacist about this, and i'm thinking of dropping one of the metformin and go back to 2 a day to see what happens.",
i will talk to the pharmacist first.,
i'm interested if anyone else has experienced this effect and what you did about it.,
or if there is anyone else out there with rosacea and on metformin and if this has been an issue for you :?,
red nose or much better glycaemic control and faster weight loss.,
"people can see my nose more easily than the diabetes, which i was managing much better before i started on the metformin :?",
:roll: :cry:,
"hi all, i bought some cold medication that contains: paracetamol, phenylephrine and guaifenesin.",
"on the leaflet is says ""do not take if you have diabetes"" (along other medical conditions).",
i'm wondering - why?,
"is there any specific reason or is this just general ""advice""?",
"it's not even in the ""take special care"" section, but in the big bold ""do not take"".",
"i know that there are other therapies/treatments for cold, i was just curious if there's anything special about those ingredients that can be ""bad"" for diabetics.",
"i always assumed that if something can affect you bg, it would be in the ""take care"" section, and the ""do not take"" section was for serious, potentially life-threatening interactions.",
so it basically may raise your bg.,
"i wouldn't think that's a reason to put it under ""do not take""... stuff like: it raises blood pressure and you have hypertension = do not take.",
i don't like being treated like a moron...,
"hi there, i have been having some problems recently and wanted to see if anyone is in a similar position/ may be able to give me any advice.",
"i have had type 1 diabetes for 18 years (since 7), the last few years i haven't been well controlled.",
"february my hba1c was at 100 and last month was at 80. the last few weeks i have been carb counting everything and really keeping an eye on everything i eat and my sugars, sometimes testing 10-15 times a day to ensure i get a good idea of patterns after eating certain foods etc.",
this has obviously meant my blood sugars have gone from being too high on average to being pretty stabilized between 4 and 8 very quickly.,
"last week i had some pain in my heart and have had a tight chest, some gut pain (assumed it could be gerd), blocked nose and cold symptoms.",
"my calves also get very tight and hurt when i walk too fast, there is no swelling and no unusual marks on them.",
i also find my legs and arms can get warm and uncomfortable when resting them at certain angles.,
"i havent lost any feeling on my feet, arms, fingers or anywhere as i check regularly.",
"i went to the doctors about my heart and they checked my blood pressure, bpm, heart beat pattern and ran an ecg and all came back normal, said it could be down to stress.",
"i guess my thinking is could it be neuropathy, or could the pains be my sugars being controlled in a short space of time and not gradually.",
has anyone done this and had any of these problems?,
thank you very much!,
kitedoc said: hi @benack1992 and welcome.,
it sounds to me like perhaps you have had a viral infection of some sort.,
"that is a guess, not professional advice or opinion.",
"as they say, if pain (and other things persist or worsen) see your doctor again.",
great to see you really paying attention to you bsls.,
would some form of glucose monitoring device ease the trauma on your fingers from so many pinpricks.?,
"there are threads on site about libre, and the pump cgms which might be read off a mobile phone (?",
android mostly) without need for the pump.,
hope you are feeling better soon.,
click to expand... nigelstevens said: i dont want to alarm you but the symptoms of pains in the extremities tightness in the chest were the first symptoms i had to diagnose diabetes by.,
however there was more at play than just diabetes.,
i had the full range of blood tests.,
blood pressure etc and was told for months there wad nothing wrong.,
a couple of hospital trips found nothing but chest pains kept popping up.,
eventually after i almost collapsed whilst walking to the doctors i was taken back into hospital and test done showed i had had a heart attack whilst walking into the doctors.,
all those chest pains had been angina attacks.,
which they hadnt caught whilst happening.,
i ended up with 2 stents in my heart.,
however theres an item known as a gtn spray that can help relieve the pain of angina attacks.,
its full name is glyceryl trinitrate.,
it might be worth discussing this with your doctor to see if they will prescribe you one if the chest pains are regular.,
that way you can see if that helps.,
"click to expand... hi nigel, thanks very much for replying and alarming is fine with me i just want to make sure i look after myself and find out if anythings wrong.",
"i did look at most heart problems online to see if they could match up and angina seems to say the chest pains come on when doing physical activity and goes away on resting, whereas i seem to have the opposite it will come about when sitting down but never when going on a run or a long walk.",
did you get the pains just when doing activity or was it similar?,
thanks very much for your help.,
"kitedoc said: hi @benack1992 , a goof friend of mine used to message me with a query: welfare cheque ?",
after a double take i realised he was checking up on my welfare.,
so i enquire the same of you: welfare cheque?,
how are you travelling ?,
"click to expand... hi kitedoc, appreciate the message!",
most of the symptoms are now gone so think it's possible it could have been a stomach virus or chest infection.,
had also put on a bit of weight so could of explained some pains.,
keeping well controlled and got my resting heart rate down to 62.,
going to write everything down and let my doctor know at my next appointment.,
my next hba1c is the end of november so will post results when i get them!,

hi all i'm recovering from a chest infection but i've pulled a muscle around my rib cage by coughing too hard.,
i've been taking ibuprofen and paracetemol for about 4 days so want to stop them but i'm still in a fair bit of pain.,
i will go to pharmacy tonight to see if they can recommend something that is ok for type 1 but thought id see if any of you had any advice?,
"thanks andres sent from the diabetes forum app andbreathe said: is the pulled muscle your conclusion or was that diagnosed by a doctor, after an examination?",
"the reason i ask is i had this a few years ago, but when the doc examined me, he concluded i actually had pleurisy, along with the persistent chest infection.",
"if i recall correctly i was treated by mega-antibiotics, pain relief and a steam/vapour inhalation.",
"it wasn't a quick fix, unfortunately.",
"that breathing thing is a pest sometimes, but better than the alternative.",
"click to expand... hi andbreathe, its my conlcusion i kind of felt it go when i coughed really hard and it does get better during the day when i'm up and about.",
its just at night when i'm trying to sleep its so uncomfortable it keeps me awake.,
"i finish my anitobiotics today, do you think i should go back to gp just to make sure?",
thanks a brunneria said: is there any chance you might have cracked a rib with the force of the coughing?,
"its very unlikely, but it did happen to my grandmother.",
although you are unlikely to have osteoporosis.,
"she thought it was a strained muscle, and only went to the doc when it took so long to heal.",
"they don't actually do much for ribs nowadays, but i think it put her mind at rest to know that the discomfort had a reason!",
click to expand... its amazing what damage you can do just coughing isnt it!!,
i've been trynig to read online about it and mostly it says just tro try to rest even if its ribs or muscle strain.,
but just wondered if there anything i could get from chemist to help with the pain really.,
"andbreathe said: i'm not a frequent flyer at the doc's, but based on my own experience, i'd want someone to have a listen to my chest.",
"although the steam/vapour inhalations didn't have any real medical component, it was very soothing.",
"it could be worth a try, with menthol crystals or karvol?",
not too much or it's unpleasant.,
i hadn't dealt with the underlying condition too sensibly when it happened to me.,
"i had been sailing for 3 weeks, and took the beginnings of the chest infection with me.",
"disturbed sleep patterns, by virtue of time zone changes and long passagemaking meant i got tired and the chest infection moved in.",
"this was before we had our blue water first aid kit, so i had no antibiotics to hand, and i couldn't face going to the local medics, so stuck with it.",
"so, i ended up driving from gatwick to the local walk-in centre for antibiotics, and negotiating myself not to go to hospital.",
"it took ages to finally get over that, and the decent ignoring i gave it at the outset didn't help, and was compounded by not reacting to the lack of material improvement quickly enough.",
"to be fair, if i'm going to be ill, my chest can be the starting point, but i'd be much more cautious these days.",
"click to expand... ooh, thast sounds bad!",
"i'm not feeling particlarly unwell, i've stopped coughing up phlegm (sorry not nice) i'm just uncomfortable, so maybe i'll just see if improves over the next few days.",
all the reading on the internet (what did we do before google???),
says it just takes time.,
perhaps the chemist can suggest some pain relief gel or something that is ok for type 1 thanks enclave....love the little nurse poohtiggy said: every time i have a cold i end up with a chest infection which is unpleasant and painful.,
if i were you i would definitely get a check up at the surgery.,
my gp insists that when my antibiotics are finished i see him again to make sure the infection has completely cleared.,
sometimes i have needed a second course of antibiotics click to expand...,
thanks poohtiggy.,
think after everyones replies i'll book in for a checkering the drs.,
sent from the diabetes forum app saw my dr today and he sent me for a chest x-ray so glad i went back.,
thanks for the support everyone.,
results be back in a few days so hopefully will know what's going on.,

"i was diagnosed with t2 two months ago and take 500mg sr metformin with breakfast (mainly porridge) each day but as a life-long migrainer, i am experiencing more frequent and severe migraines.",
my gp doesn't think there should be a link with the metformin and that the reason for the increase is probably related to anxiety relating to my new condition.,
just wondering if anyone else out there has experienced similar problems with headaches/migraines?,
flossymartin said: hi yes i have had several migraines since i started glucophage 6 weeks ago .especially when increasing the dose above 1500mg.previously i got a migraine about every 3 months .i am now on 2000mg a day and although the migraines have settled i am tired and bloated and queasy.due to have bloods checked next week and a review so hoping it's settled down by then .,
click to expand... glad to hear your migraines have settled and hope you have much improved bloods as a result of your review.,
"i also have a review next week so, fingers crossed!",
"hi all, was diagnosed with t2 end of july put on metformin.",
before i was diagnosed i was experiencing frequent bouts of pins and needles in my hands.,
"this has continued since diagnosis, even sitting here now typing i have pins and needles across the knuckles area.",
has anyone heard of a link between diabetes and pins and needles in the hands.,
i know in the feet it can be a sign of neuropathy.,
bit worried becuase often drop things as well and have put this down to psychiatric medication.,
have checked all side effects of meds and nothing down there.,
just wondering whether this is something else i should be mentioned to the gp.,
"thanks jo thank you both for your replies, i am concerned about the neuropathy side of things but interesting that wallycorker has found it linked to high bg for them.",
i am still working on getting my bg down but readings are very up and down having been high on diagnosis.,
my last checkup with my gp was cancelled becuase she was sick but am due to see her this week to review whether need to increase up metformin.,
most of my readings at the moment are between 8 and 16.6mmol/l so am expecting her to say that metformin needs to be doubled.,
"my gp on diagnosis said she was going to treat me aggressively because of my age (35), strong family history (mum was diagnosed a month before me!!",
"), and some of the psychiatric meds i take could be at least partially to blame for tipping me over the diabetic edge but it is not safe for me to stop or cut down them.",
please bear with me i am trying to get head round this diabetes thing.,
thanks jo again thanks for all the replies.,
got an 18.9mmol/l today which is my highest since being diagnosed but i do know the reason for it as we went out for a meal and i had a couple of things i shouldn't have had!,
but it was lovely to have them!,
"i have porridge with some sultanas for breakfast, nothing for lunch usually then a cooked meal or a salad with egg and cheese for dinner.",
my bg is peaking after breakfast so i am working on that at the moment.,
i have tried very hard to cut down on the things containing sugar and i do limit carbo but am not prepared to cut carbo out of diet completely.,
it would be too limiting within my diet.,
thanks jo p.s reassuring to hear about pins and needles and high bg thanks thanks again for the advice regarding porridge and breakfast.,
i will have to do some more monitoring and try some different things to see what happens.,
"good job i've brought some test strips because when i asked the diabetic nurse how often i could order on perscription her reply was no more than 50 strips a month, this doesn't allow two per day!!",
not helpful when you are trying to get a picture of what on earth is going on bg wise.,
thanks jo,
has any one else experienced this and is it something i should get looked at?,
i am type 1 and woke up at around 5am feeling a little sick next thing am throwing up bile!,
"managed to go back to bed but still feel a little sick, i don't have ketones either sent from the diabetes forum app thanks no alcohol consumed to be honest i don't really drink and of i do i only have low alcohol larger and prob have a max of 2 bottles (i am a bit boring) i have just re tested my self and i know have ketones at 2.3 and 21mmol i've had a dose of fat acting insulin to see if this helps really hope i am not going dka!!",
sent from the diabetes forum app breathing got heavier sick feeling got worse and ketones stayed around i have just got back from a&e were they put me on a drip for 2 hours to get fluids in my system ketones have gone bg have gone lower and sick feeling gone so all good thanks for words of advice sent from the diabetes forum app,
can anyone help me with this one?,
i've started working out at the gym again - about an hour on the treadmill (power walk/run) and then 15 mins on the bike.,
"i stretch properly before and after and feel fine generally (no breathlessness or stiffness), but when i get home find that within an hour i start shivering uncontrollably!!!",
"last time i went (tues) i couldn't get warm at all (even well into the night), and i am going back to the gym tonight and dreading a repeat of this.",
my sugar before exercise was around 5mmol so i ate a fun-size twix (loving the benefit of exercise!),
", ate 1 glucose tab after the treadmill, then tested after my workout and bs was 10.9mmol.",
"had a salad for dinner (no carbs - prawns and greens), then a mini twister lolly (5g carbs).",
did no insulin for this.....figured my exercise would cover it.,
went to bed and my sugar was 18.5mmol.,
:shock: corrected with 4 units (1 unit to 2mmol drop ratio) and after a sleepless night (of shivering!),
finally got up at 5.30 feeling like it was through the roof when actualy it was 4.2mmol.,
firstly - can anyone advise on the shivering thing?,
it's really uncomfortable!!!,
second - assume this high then subsequent low was caused by a glucose dump - i thought i might have avoided this by having a snack before the gym...... :?,
any thoughts/ideas greatly appreciated!!!,
"thanks ma5on thanks sandy what you say makes great sense, and things seem to be settling down now.",
"you would have laughed at me yesterday though - nearly fell off the treadmill, and when i tested i had dropped to 2.0!!!",
"when i started i was 12.5, so i guess at least what i'm doing is effective!!!",
(am yet to lose any weight though!),
"thank you for taking the time to reply, much appreciated 9especially when you have so much going on in your own life - hope things are better!)",
ma5on x thanks katharine - i though i was losing the plot a bit!,
"yep, fergus explained about the proteing thing too - my dietician actually instructed me not to inject if i wasn't eating any carbs - when will they sort themselves out and start giving proper advice???",
the spikes aer a bit worrying to be honest.,
"i ran for an hour on monday, followed bt 20 mins on the bike, and a powerplate session.",
lowest sugar this time was 4.5 - excellent (despite feeling hypo!,
"), and was impressed with my ability to test and pedal!!!",
sugar on getting home - 7.5 (but had a thumbsized glass of sugary orange just in case i was heading down!,
"), so was ok with that.",
dinner (at 3pm) was a steak sandwich and salad - did the insulin to cover it (8 units) and tested 2 hours later - bm was 18.5mmol.,
guessed it was coming down so tested 2 hours later when it was 17.5.,
did a correction dose of 4 units.,
"bedtime (9.30pm cos it was a ""schoolnight"") back up to 19.5!!!",
didn't want to correct any more so did my usual overnight of levemir (25ui) and went to bed.,
woke up every hour through the night feeling high but tested in the low 4's everytime.,
"i actually had a glucose tablet at 2am and another at 4am, and when i got up at 5.30 my sugar was 4.2.",
does this make sense to anyone????,
i'm still struggling to understand it all...... :?,
thanks ma5on decided to correct,
just been wondering why there are so few t1d people around?,
i post my fasting bg and on other threads and it seems there are lots of posting from t2 but not so many t1.,
"helensaramay said: a couple of reasons come to my mind - 90% of people with diabetes have type 2 - fasting bg, for type 1, signifies how good your insulin dose is; not the same as type 2 click to expand... why not?",
don't t1s want to share fbg and their successes and tips for getting flat?,
@helensaramay therower said: there are a lot fewer of us as already pointed out.,
i also think that we have different priorities in our lives.,
"i've often spoken to t2's away from the forum and it's clear when just having a general chat about "" diabetes "" that as different diabetics we have differing outlooks and priorities in everyday life.",
click to expand... @therower aren't we all interested in low bg?,
"scott-c said: it's because we're special, @suejb !",
"as helen points out, numerically, t1 is about 10% of the total t community and that's probably reflected in the forum membership too.",
"still, got to look on the bright side!",
"when the triffids or aliens invade, or a pandemic breaks out, or david icke's predictions of the royal family unzipping their human skins to release their inner lizards come true, it'll probably turn out t1s are immune from all that stuff because they're only going to go after people with working beta cells....",
i think that many t1s have joined and contributed in good faith but have left after getting overwhelmed with the low carbing messaging.,
"it's not so much the case now, but there's still instances of newly dx'd t1s posting about things totally unrelated to diet, only to be met with a slew of posts from people telling them they are going to die if they don't follow the dictates of bernstein.",

"hi all, my nearly 4 year old granddaughter was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in december last year after going into dka.",
thank goodness after a week in hospital she fully recovered.,
what id like too know is when a diabetic is low or high how does this make you feel?,
"being that my granddaughter is only 3 she cant explain and id just like to try and understand what she goes through, i can see the obvious signs of when shes low i.e tired, drowsy lethargic but thats it.",
thankyou so much for a incite into your daily struggles.,
"my granddaughter has coped extremely well and does all the things any other 3 year old does, she just requires more of a watchful eye!",
its quite incredible how much ignorance surrounds type 1 diabetes and how much you learn in a short space of time.,
i just wanted to try and get a idea how it makes my granddaughter feel and your reply has helped me with that she and my grandson are my world and to get some idea of how she could be feeling when having a high or low will hopefully aid me to help her more,

sometimes if you lose weight the cholesterol level will be temporarily a bit higher.,
"click to expand... zand, thanks for your reply.",
"i don't know where you live or what age you are, but when i was in my 30s 40s and 50s my cholesterol never changed it was always between 3.0 and 4.0, now that i'm in my 60s it has changed, it is 4.1, the only reason i mention this is because the nurse/practitioner at my practice told me it was high - i though rubbish that's what it's been all my life and i know at one point the british heart foundation recommended no higher than 6, so 6 and under was good - the nurse told me it depends on your age, the older you are then 4 is not good - sorry but i just don't buy it, she didn't know me, or test me in my 30s 40s and beyond.",
i'm not taking statins just because my cholesterol is the same numeric as it was 20 years ago.,

"i am contemplating following dr bernstein's diabetic solution, and wondering if there are any other following it.",
"i am already on a lchf, but what really draws me to his diet plan is the necessity to get fasting bg levels and hba1c down to around 4.8, in order to eliminate diabetic complications and to keep my few raining insulin beta cells i have for as long as possible (research has demonstrated that beta cell burnout can be slowed or halted by normalizing blood sugars.)",
hardest thing will be the elimination of all fruit.,
"i have about 12g fruit carbs per day, but to get down to 4.8 levels they will have to go.... on a positive side, dr bernstein says he has not eaten fruit for 40 years, he is now 80, with no complications.",

"sent from the diabetes forum app no, not thinking of stopping lchf, just enhancing it in line with dr bernstein's recommendation.",
which is lchf but with quite a few more no-no's / restrictions eg no fruit.,
lchf is most certainly working for me.,

i was scheduled to have a torn rotator cuff and bone spur in my right shoulder surgically repaired on nov 1.,
my doctor received my a1c results on tues which was 9.2.,
the plan was to double my glipizide to 10mg in morning and 10mg in evening and repeat a1c on oct 27 and if still high would reschedule the surgery.,
i had a cortisone shot aug 23 and the blood test sept 23.,
i believe the shot may have increased my results.,
i also have taken 4-6 advil a day for pain and inflammation.,
"i am breaking out in hives and was told to stop the advil, which i did for 3 days but still getting hives and in too much pain not to take it.",
iwas blindsided by a call from the surgeon's secretary on thurs that he cancelled my surgery after speaking to my doctor about my high a1c.,
it has to be 9.0 or less for surgery.,
does anyone know how i can lower it quickly?,
i am in severe pain and not sleeping.,
i want to have the surgery by the beginning of dec.,
"i have left a message for my doctor to discuss the plan, how many blood tests i have to have to clear me.",
she has not returned my call or email.,
very frustrated that i don't know what to expect or how long i have to wait.,
i could use some advise on how to lower it quickly at least to 8.5.,
i believe the hive are due to stress.,
thank you!,
hello daisy thank you for the information.,
i was diagnosed @5 years ago with type 2 but had been under control until the past few months.,
i have taken my blood sugar readings in the morning before breakfast and they have slowly crept up from 150-285.,
i do think the later number may be due to cortisone injection.,
do you know how long it takes for the cortisone to leave my body?,
i do have to say that i am very bad at watching my carbs.,
"i do love sweets, baked potato, sandwich with bread for lunch, etc.",
but because i now can not have my surgery has been a wake up call.,
i can't go cold turkey and cut all but am going to try.,
"tues my bs was 287, wed 265, thurs 242, fri 229, & sat 233.",
it is coming down slowly but i have to look at your recipes for lunch ideas.,
"i mainly eat chicken, pork chop, ground turkey, and very little beef for dinner.",
i just have to incorporate more veggies.,
i got a protein shake to try and thought that i could have it in the evening if i am looking for a snack.,
i love fruit and saw on your site that i shouldn't eat much.,
i was disappointed since i thought that would keep me from eating sweets.,
i found your explanation of diabetes much easier to understand than what my doctor told me.,
i will print you info and review the sites you mentioned.,
i am so stressed about not having the surgery and i know the stress can increase my sugars but don't know how to relax.,
thank you so much for the info.,
i am glad i found your site.,
can you recommend any good low carb cookbooks that have easy and quick real food recipes?,
pleinster said: hi.,
many of us on this site have managed to get our blood sugar levels down to a manageable level by either dramatically reducing or pretty much just avoiding food with carbohydrates (particularly those foods which have more than 10g carb per 100g of product - see labels).,
"like a number here, i got my levels down pretty quickly (on no meds) purely by avoiding the following foods ; bread, cereal, potatoes, pasta and rice.",
just cutting these foods out as well as the obvious sugary rubbish should make a big difference.,
this is because carbohydrates turn to sugar in the blood...but no-one tells us that !,
pity you don't have a self-testing meter as testing your levels before and a couple of hours after food would let you know exactly how much difference it is making just to avoid toast !,
"hopefully, this would make a noticable difference by the 27th.",
"i am tagging @daisy1 , who will be along with some basic but very important info for you to read through and consider.",
check out the low carb and type 2 threads on this site.,
good luck.,
click to expand... hello and that you very much for your encouragement an support.,
i am glad i found this site.,
i need all the info i can get on lowering my a1c.,
i am super stressed about this whole situation.,
"i have to admit that my biggest fault is carbs, candy and baked goods.",
i did receive some great info from daisy1.,
it was written so i could actually understand what it all means.,
"i do test daily, see my post to daisy1 below along with my recent numbers.",
i am going to give it my all.,
thank you very much for passing my info to daisy1 and your information and support.,
any suggestions for destressing?,
my brother reading this morning was 4.6 we know this way too low he has eaten a banana had a few jelly babies now having toast and marmalade how long will we leave before retesting please help don't want to phone dr just now susan my brother is 64 i joined here for information my brother is the diabtic he is not good on computer stuff he is type 2: and in insulin as well as exenetide and metformin,
hello all i found out i had type 2 last year with bs at 34 have been stable most of the time sticking to low carbs and for the most part its around 6.8 sometimes middle 7s but noticed the other day my left foot is turning very dark purple in places and my toes have had a tingling sensation for a few months is this normal or should i visit the doctor well i do have a assessment with my gp on the 22 about my drugs ect so will mention it to her ty guys ickihun said: roy call 111 for advice.,
i found them very helpful.,
dr called me back.,
i was tested for thrombosis.,
it's a killer.,
please tell me your not on canagliflozin or dapagliflozin?,

"which bit of ""do not wait"" do you not understand?",
if your foot is turning purple there is a very strong probability that it is not getting enough blood.,
this slid usually caused by some form of blockage in an artery.,
there are two risks.,
one is that tissue in your foot dies leading to potential gangrene and amputation.,
the second is that whatever blockage you have is dislodged and leads to thrombosis.,
"neither of these are things you want, so please do not wait till the 22nd.",
as a diabetic it is imperative that you get seen as soon as possible.,
sent from my iphone using tapatalk click to expand... its only purple blotches and is not getting any worse if it was cold to the touch and the foot was turning purple blue then yep id seek medical help right away,
when i was diagnosed 3 weeks ago i got given a sharp box and its not been put on my prescription and theyre not giving me one until it is.,
"does anyone not have a sharp box, where do you put used needles etc",
good evening everyone at first i want to thank everyone who helped me in this forum i have reached good results and this is thanks to god and your virtues.,
so i decided to convey my experience to the women and men of my town.,
"i have already set up a legal association and now every week i gather some sick women and men measure them with blood sugar and blood pressure as i learned from you, i am not a doctor, i give them advice and i leave the other things to the doctors i will definitely record all the data is there any advice for me and thanks guzzler said: you will spread the word about diet and more people will benefit which is an excellent cause to take up.",
my advice would be to concentrate on people like yourself who are looking to avoid medications and/or insulin until you are absolutely confident about your knowledge base on these treatments.,
"as you say, we are not doctors so we can tell of our own experiences but we cannot give medical advice or diagnose someone who fears they may have diabetes.",
always open and close your sessions with the words 'i am not a doctor' so that people are perfectly clear on where to go for further advice on treatment.,
good luck with your sessions and congratulations on being proactive in your community.,

hi can i get some advise please.,
had bloods checked in september and spoke to dr receptionist and was advised no further action.,
however by chance i went to see the dr on friday and was advised that my hba1c was 45.,
i understand that this is classed as pre diabetic even though they don't like to use the term.,
i am already on hb medication and my father had diabetes and i also had gestational nearly 9 years ago and was insulin dependant three times a day.,
the only advice the dr gave me was lifestyle change and nothing else...... where do i start????,
any advice greatly appreciated.,
thank you all for the advice.,
unfortunately i lost my father in the summer due to various medical issues including diabetes.,
"besides that, what i found shocking is that the dr offered no advice on what to do.",
of course losing weight is part of what needs to be done and to increase exercise.,
i was given advice by a family member who is a retired gp is to give up wheat.,
has anyone had success with this?,
when i did have gestational diabetes my consultant told me a few thing we're going against me.,
1 ethic background.,
2 family history,
when is the best time for you to take it with the least side affects.,
"i have been advised to take mine in the middle of my evening meal, so around 6pm and i have just started on 1000mg.",
"i'm only on my second day and im feeling pretty awful, should i split the tablet and go to 500mg or move it to a dif time in the day, or just put up with it ?",
thanks steve carty said: hi hendie you must not split a sr tablet if you are having bad reactions to the 1000g pill try asking your gp if you can have the dose in 2 500g so that you can take 1 with breakfast and 1 with your evening meal.,
carol click to expand...,
"i did wonder about if it was acceptable to split the sr tablet or not as they may not have the same quantity of each ingredient in each half, but they have a split line on them for some reason.",
"i have had enough of a hard time obtaining the sr tablets that im just going to put up with it, whats strange is that the side affects are different of that of the normal metformin.",
i also wonder if there mite be some die off or herx reaction of the yeast if my blood sugars are lowering.,
"thanks steve oky so the side affects are getting easier as each day goes by which is nice, but still have the usual extra gas ect but i get extra extra gas if i eat carbs so for now im going to stick to very low carbs to ease the side affects.",
"i can visibly see some benefits already and i have only been on it for 4 days and this being my 5th, the yeast has started to ease up all over my body which is nice i have been taking mine with my evening meal and it is still lasting till my evening meal the next day so far.",
"steve hpprkm said: i have just a prescription for sr metformin, having asked my gp to switch from regular metformin, though not started new prescription yet, i thought the idea was to ease symptoms that regular metformin can cause, ie gas and stomach problems, having read this post i am a little concerned.",
are there benefits to taking sr then?,
click to expand...,
the difference of sr metformin compared to normal metformin is still 100x more tolerable.,
"i think by the nature of what metformin does that there will be some side affects but hopefully not for long once your body gets used to it on the sr. normal metformin for me i had to stop after 1 week as it was too unbearable, but after 5 days on the sr the side affects are by far alot better than the normal metformin.",
steve,
on my recent visit to the diabetes clinic in october i had some blood tests done.,
"one was my hba1c which at the time was 67, egr (which i understand is kidney function),, triglycerides (at 0.5 mmol/l) and hdl cholesterol: at 2.7mmol/l.",
my question is this - what should hdl cholesterol be?,
"i'm totally confused as to the information on the web (i know there are 2 types of cholesterol - good and bad), and i just wanted to clarity if i needed to be concerned at the level.",
any answers?,
thanks for the responses all.,
phew!,
a bit of good news for a change.,
"the egfr was >90 and my hba1c is now 50, so hopefully doing something right!",
well they never gave me the ldl cholesterol or the total cholesterol level - just the hdl.,
i'm sure my docs will get in touch if they think i should have more tests.,
"prem51 said: @nicksu as you have your hdl and triglycerides figures you can enter them into this calculator to get your ldl figure, and hdl/ldl/triglycerides ratios which are more relevant than the individual or total figures: http://www.hughcalc.org/chol-si.php click to expand...",
thank you for that.,
and the result is: (drum roll!),
"your hdl of 2.7 is optimal your triglyceride level of 0.5 is normal your triglycerides/hdl ratio is: 0.424 - (preferably under 4, ideally under 2) ideal whew!",
well i finally had my cholesterol figures back.,
only from a blood test that was done in the middle of october (and not even a fasting one).,
"it took them until last week to send the letter out (letter dictated on the 14th december, not typed till 17 january) and then not sent out until the 6th february.",
in that they say that my level is 5.6.,
gone through the calculator and it appears i am borderline.,
humbug!,
the diabetic clinic says that they would like me to take statins.,
i'd be inclined to say no and to try something else e.g.,
acv/arthichoke/plant sterols.,
anyone had any success with any of these?,
i'm really reluctant to take statins unless i absolutely have to (since i know one possible side effect is hair loss - and mine has never quite recovered from an underactive thyroid).,
thoughts anyone?,
i know the official line is that they like your levels to be under 4.0 (has anyone actually managed that?),
"i forgot to ask about this - my accu chek compact plus meter has not been checked against a control solution (just ordered one today), but when i recently went to the hospital to give my blood sample, i tested my bg level at home before and after the visit.",
my meter gave readings of 6.7 and 6.3 taken less than one hour apart.,
the hospital sample taken in between these two produced a reading of 5.3!,
1,
can i infer from this that my meter is reading about 1mmol/l too high?,
2,
will the control solution provide a more accurate measure of the machine's error margin?,
thanks.,
thanks!,
"the way i understand it (or don't) is that the control solution is set at an accurate level of, say, 8.5, and the manufacturers are just saying any reading between 6.9 and 9.1 is within their specified level of accuracy .",
"if i am getting that right, then, i would know exactly what the glucose content of the solution is and be able to see from my meter reading exactly how accurate it is.",
is that about right?,
ok - i'll ask the manufacturer then.,
only way.,
i will report back.,
"actually, though, i do think your interpretation (mid-point between stated tolerance limits) must be about right, as the law requires a certain percentage (+/-) accuracy.",
could well be so.,
i just phoned them and the woman seemed to have no idea.,
"i had to explain the question three times, and then she said she's never been asked that before.",
i find this incredible.,
what i also find hard to believe is the wide margin they permit in your test results.,
my strips specify 6.7 - 9.0 mmo0l/l as the limiting readings permitted.,
that means an accuracy of only +/- 15% (assuming midpoint is the actual glucose content).,
"she's ""going to call me back"".",
":roll: yes, they are the legal ones; meters have to give readings less than 15% out more than 90% of the time (or something along those lines).",
"problem for me is that my actual readings appear to be at least 1.0 mmol/l above the correct readings, if the hospital is accurate.",
that's a lot.,
"the thing is that i took two readings around the hospital one, which i understand is super-accurate.",
"if i consistently get such high readings with the control solution (e.g., around 8.5 - 9.0) i think it will be fair to say my meter is about 1 mmol/l over.",
no phone call.,
"yes - as this conversation is developing, so is my opinion - that the only way to do this is by running a sequence of home control solution readings.",
i think we really have to assume that the control solution falls about mid-way between the specified limits.,
"if your meter reads consistently high or low for the control, then adjust your bg readings by that amount.",
"still no phone call, but i too emailed them at the same time.",
"could be entertaining though ... by the way, i'd appreciate an opinion on this: i haven't done a proper gtt test but for now i thought i'd monitor my response to a light tea.",
"it consisted of three small slices of wholemeal bread, one fried egg, butter, a substantial blob of peanut butter, two glasses of white wine.",
"results (probably higher than true readings because of the machine): before the food - 6.5, 1 hr after the food- 6.8.",
"1.5 hr after the food - 7.9, 2hr after the food - 7.4 what do you make of that ??",
?,
i am going to austria in december and was wondering with my type 2 what foods are a no no many thanks for all your help,
"went into my local holland and barrett today have been shopping there for years but was searching for chromium the lady asked me ""are you diabetic?""",
yes i replied to which i got sorry we cant sell you anything as its against the law!,
anyone else heard of this i did say what!,
your kidding she replied its the law so i have asked their head office to clarify kind of julia roberts moment in pretty woman the phrase used was its against the law i could lose my job not am i aware of how to use the product and any potential side effects with diabetes i would have explained to the lady that the cable was not fit for purpose unless she enclosed the socket end in an ip44 enclosure and had a 30ma rcd at the plug end oldvatr said: .,

ta thankyou to all replys i think they may of been out of date.thanks again everyone,
over the past few months i have been suffering from dizzy spells.,
i feel lightheaded and unsteady.,
its happening more and more often and its almost a daily thing.,
could this be caused by diabetes and if so could it go away.,
doctor has been no help.,
i recently had my hba1c tests and it was over 9 .,
the doctor increased my metformin from 1 tablet twice a day to 2 tablets twice a day.,
i was told to start by increasing the morning dose and after 2 weeks increase my evening dose.,
"i have had a lot of stomach discomfort, and terrible indigestion since increasing the does.",
i work up the other morning in extreme pain like i was having a heart attack.,
the pain went after taking antacids.,
"indigestion is something i get every now and then, but it is usually due to eating something i should avoid.",
this day i don't think i had eaten anything that would cause it.,
"but i had increased my evening dose of metformin, so i was and am on 4 tablets a day.",
"i have had more general discomfort than usual, muscle pains and more breathlessness.the difficult is i have other health problems so knowing which one is caused by which is a nightmare.",
i also tend to let myself get dehydrated at night as i have bladder problems which i having investigations for at the moment.,
if i don't stop drinking about at about 7pm i end up waking numerous times to go to the loo.,
the only drink i have after 7pm is a few sips of water to help swallow my medications.,
sorry for being so long winded.,
"my main question is does lactic acidosis come on suddenly, or does it build up over days or weeks?",
paul thanks.,
i've got to see my gp next week about something else so i will talk to him about it.,
"i don't think i have lactic acidosis, i was curious about whether it was sudden or gradual onset.",
i saw something on the tv yesterday that said patients are risking their health because they don't read the information sheets that come with their medication.,
so i had a look at mine.,
"it gave a number of symptoms to watch out for including severe indigestion,muscle spasms etc it said if you have any of these symptoms when taking metformin to go immediately to the nearest hospital a&e because these symptoms can be signs of lactic acidosis.",
i don't think what i'm experiencing is severe enough for a&e.,
"i had muscle spasms, pains and a number of the other symptoms list prior to my diabetes diagnose due to other illnesses, and they can vary in severity.",
"they seem to have got somewhat worse since my metformin was increased, but it could just be coincidence.",
the indigestion and stomach problems are particularly bad.,
my feeling is my body is taking time to adapt to them.,
i will ask my doctor if i can change to a slow release version.,
paul,
"please this is a very important step in your daily regime of taking care of diabetes, don't for a moment think of not changing your sharps evey single use!!!!!!!!",
also remember the importance of site rotation when administrating your insulin to prevent lypohypertrophy.,
i am type 2 since diagnosis in 2000.,
i have just developed a red rash around my ankles and halfway up my legs.,
what's going on...and treatment.,
it's painless and none itchy.,
"hi i am new to this forum and the question i would like to ask is"" overnight is it normal to lose 8 points ?",
i can go to bed with a reading of 14.8 and in the morning get a reading of 6.3.,
i take no medication and am diet controlled.,

thankyou squire fulwood that explanation was very helpful,
hi seen a fair few postings where people have mentioned 'memory loss'.,
"as a diabetic (type 1, 25 years and now using a pump) how many of us think we have some memory loss compared to non diabetics?",
"myself, i have had poor short term memory for 8+ years now, and it does really bug me that i have to write everything down all the time.",
"i would just be interested to know how many others think they have short term memory loss, and what type of diabetes they have, and how long.",
"i know there will be the normal wit, of 'i can't remember!!!!",
"', and i 'm not doing a study of it, just interested to know how us diabetics fare with this subject.....",
"i was put (needlessly) on statins for 10 years, and during that time i had horrendous short term memory loss.",
i still have bad memory despite having come off statins 15 months ago.,
"can remember long term things as clear as anything, but short term, is absolutely dreadful.",
wonder how much of it may have been related to previous hypo's....in which case i have to accept that i am always going to be like it.....,

i have been trying for a child now for a few years.,
my wife and i have recently gone onto the nhs for assisted conception and after several tests including my 48hr sperm survival test - it was concluded that i had a low sperm count with poor motility and morphology.,
to add to this my wife also has some problems so we have been advised to go for icsi.,
"i asked the consultant if my type 1 diabetes could be a problem for the poor sperm count, motility etc but he sort of shrugged his shoulders and said maybe, maybe not - (however i have always had an excellent sugar control).",
im now getting mixed opinions.,
"my gp, and diabetic nurse say no your diabetes does not affect your sperm count/health, but when i google stuff on line there are studies to suggest different.",
"i have never come across any published information during health check-ups or in my diabetic balance magazine, but one would assume that could be a possibility are there any official studies into with type1 diabetic men and their sperm count?",

i have been properly testing for the last 4 days as my diebeties was out of control i suffer with depression and on bad days eat what i shouldn't and it's had an effect so big wake up call so now trying to lose weight and eat healthy to get my diebeties back under control just finding it hard to know what i can and can't have,
"hi, sorry to post but i am having trouble finding information and i thought someone might be able to help.",
i have a nearly 4 year old boy who is well in himself but for the last few weeks his urine has had a very odd sweet smell to it.,
i have done 3 urine tests and all have come back absolutely normal with no sign of glucose or ketones or anything else for that matter.,
this is dip test not lab test.,
the gp as a result thinks i'm mad but i am not happy that things are ok.,
i have got him to wee into a potty and the urine smells very faintly pleasant if that makes sense!,
"the stronger sweet smell is always when i smell his pants as he does tend to leak from time to time, and his nappy also smells of it in the morning as he is not yet dry at night he had balanitis at the beginning of the year and he had antibiotics for this.",
he is no longer complaining that he is in pain but he said to me his penis felt heavy today and it may be slightly swollen.,
in terms of drinking / peeing he has some days when he has lots to drink and goes all the time and other days when he hardly drinks anything and goes very little.,
he is usually on good form if a little whiny.,
does this sound like diabetes?,
do you think that he may have a urine / yeast infection?,
nowhere does it say on the internet that these cause sweet smelling urine - if anything they apparently cause foul smelling urine.,
"there's a rare genetic disease called msud but if he has this it's the intermittent type and anyway his pee does not really smell of maple syrup, more like fruit with a faint whiff of ammonia.",
any advice would be very helpful thanks in advance.,
"over the past year i've increased my intake from 300,mg of ala to 600mg of r-ala a day, all in one morning dose.",
my sense is it's working well on my neuropathy but i realise this is an increase in the active ingredient of four times.,
just wondered how much others find to be effective and if anyone has read of problems from over use?,
i believe there was a short term trial based on 600mg of r-ala and this is what i've based my own dosage decision on.,
i believe in some countries it is now a prescribed remedy for neuropathy but i can't find any reference to prescribed dosage.,
just occurs to me if it is excessive i'm either just excreting expensive material or worse still causing some harm.,
really welcome any experiences or thoughts please?,
bluetit1802 said: i take 600mg of r-ala split in 2 doses.,
"i have read that when it is prescribed in europe it is given by intravenous infusions in large doses, but have no idea how often the infusions are given, or for how long.",

thank you that's helpful.,
just wondering how did you settle on that dosage and have you experimented with others?,
"bluetit1802 said: i am so sorry, i was mistaken.",
i take 200mg of it per day.,
i just checked the bottle.,
each capsule is 100mg.,
it is the swanson ultra double strength r-fraction ala.,
sorry to mislead you.,
the bottle instructions say to take 1 or 2 capsules per day if used as a dietary supplement.,

thank you.,
"i find it confusing sometimes supplements seem to cone in such a range of strengths, and they all seem to say take one or two a day lol.",
"will look at that brand though, i've been importing from usa but just got a bill from customs, oops!",
"juicetin said: i understand that the much mooted german studies of taking ala for peripheral neuropathy involved taking 600mg of the mix variety per day, so 50% r-ala and 50% s-ala.",
"i don't think there are any more definitive studies available, if there are i would be interested to read them.",
"it is not a widely known supplement in the uk, doctors, podiatrists and neurologists have never even heard of it.",
"personally i gave up taking the mix variety ala, even though it is much cheaper, and am now taking pure r-ala because of it's supposed substantially better effectiveness and absorption properties.",
"i have to say, i think this was a wise move as since doing so my neuropathy has improved to the point where it is now noticeable but not particularly bothersome.",
"after research, i am taking 200mg a day of r-ala (i'm not sure i could afford any more!)",
click to expand...,
didn't realise the 600mg in the study was mixed.,
i'm really thinking of dropping the dose i use.,
any pointers to the research material you used please?,
have to agree it is eye watering the price of the r-ala but subjectively it seems more helpful to me anyway.,
great shame the uk nhs doesn't seem to recognise this as it seems way more effective megadosing amiltryptaline kristin251 said: when i had neuropathy i was taking 300 mg swanson r ala for about 6 weeks and the neuropathy was gone.,
now i take 100-200 for maintenance and antinoxidants.,
sometimes i forget the second one as i don't have my tingling feet to remind me!,
click to expand... that's really good to hear.,
can i ask do you stick to a particular brand?,
don't understand why it's so hard to buy r-ala in the uk.,
i buy mine from the usa too but when you do get stung by customs it gets expensive.,
my daughter has been diagnosed with an aggressive breast cancer and has started chemotherapy - there seems to be very little information at her hospital regarding how chemo affects diabetes or any helpful hints so does anyone have any advice for diabetics in her situation or can recommend any publications please.,
"many thanks karen my pack from the penny brohn cancer care center arrived today and just as you have said, they are most helpful.",
you have gone straight to the center of my problem as both my daughter and i find it very difficult to ask for help or lean on anyone.,
however your prompt and helpful response has shown me that i need to get over that hang up and get out there.this whole thing from first scan to chemo has happened at a whirl wind pace so advice that helps us to get help fast is very useful.,
i also want to support my lovely son in law who is devastated by the whole ghastly process but has found strength from somewhere.,
i will follow up your searches and also pass on your kind and positive message best wishes annette worried mum chemo ok .,
"steroids causing diabetic problems and the joys of ""i want a dna test"" hello all an update on lisa's chemo and her diabetes.",
the first bit of good news is that the sea bands have kept the nausea under control hurrah!!!,
and that although her blood levels were low this week she still managed to have her chemo and is now 1/4 of the way through her treatment.,
an oddity is that her bs levels have occasionally gone off the wall for no reason.,
the docs are mystified but have reduced her steroids as that might be the trigger.,
also between the chemo and diabetes her immune system is so poor that they have told her that for the first 6 days after treatment she needs to go into isolation to avoid contamination.,
she's so exhausted she sleeps most of the time then anyway.,
"she says that day time telly is rubbish but i have noticed that she is becoming addicted to the jeremy kyle show and has been known to shout out "" i want a dna test"" at the most inappropriate times.",
ian is turning a spare bedroom into an isolation room so that she doesn't have to go to hospital.,
what do you recommend she has in it????,
we have lots of laughs and keep very positive which is good as one side effect of the chemo that is increased by the type 1 is that she has developed chemo brain ( real condition honest) which results in poor cognitive abilities including poor memory.,
she has to write herself a script for any conversations particularly phone calls and the house is covered in post its.,
i keep telling her at least she has an excuse.,
"i passed on the messages from totsy, hana and chocoholic and lisa really apreciated them, she was bowled over by your messages karen and has taken your excellent advice as have i. many thanks she has put them all in a lovely book a friend made for her.",
lisa has lost her mane of curly hair but now has a blond straight wig and looks fantastic.,
she has a couple of towelling turbans she wears at home and if anyone comes round she just looks like she's washed her hair.,
ian is shaving his head in sympathy and to raise money for force who have been so helpful and are affiliated to macmillan.,
positive thoughts to all annette many thanks jane kind thoughts and useful advice .,
people on this board have been so helpful lisa is indeed ravenous nearly all the time and while she is keeping to her usual diabetic control regime she is testing much more often just in case.,
luckily the sea bands are still working - she now has a huge collection as some very kind people have been scooping them up when they see them.,
the one or two ocasions when she's had to take them off she has been very sick.,
this success with the nausea has meant that the hospital have reduced her steriods to one dose instead of three and she's happy with this.,
the bs levels do go mad but only for a few days - which she can cope with.,
i really sympathise with you and your sister.,
sounds like she has been through a hard time.,
i'm sure your support has been vital to her healing and i know how exhauting it can be for the family.,
i just wonder how people who have no one to help them manage to cope with it all.,
"also while having diabetese is rotten lisa is sure that her 18 years of being a type 1 diabetic have made her stronger, your sister sounds like a fighter as well.",
a trivial but real plus is that she looks fantasic in a wig.,
"lisa has/had very curly dark blond hair so she is now sporting a straight, henna coloured, rock chic wig and is loving it.",
good luck to you both lots of love and positive thoughts annette hello all thanks for the tip jane.,
the diabetic clinic has taken a lead and set up the meetings you describe - all very useful stuff.,
also thanks for your continuing support karen.,
here's an update on lisa's progress and there are some bits of good news.,
we are six weeks into chemo and she had her third treatment this week.,
"it was a worrying time as both she and i were convinced that because she had been feeling so weak for the past 10 days her blood results would be too low, also they had ordered an ecg to monitor her heart problems.",
"however when it came to getting the results on thursday her ecg results were described as ""fantastic!""",
and although her white cell count had halved she was still ok for treatment.,
the second bit of good news was that when the tumour was measured externally it appeared to have shrunk by 17% it's gone from 6 cm to 5 cm after two treatments.,
she has to have a scan next week to see exactly what has happened but it is all positive so far.,
the sea bands have kept the nausea under control hurrah!!!,
and she is keeping the diabetes under control as well.,
while waiting to see the oncologist ( running 2 hours late and completely over stretched.),
we sat in the packed waiting room which was a salutary experience indeed.,
there were people at all different stages of treatment.,
"we realised that in the population at large lisa is one of those unfortunate ones who has cancer and diabetes but in the ""cancer club"" , as she calls it, she's one of the lucky ones .",
between the chemo and diabetes her immune system is so poor this time that she's going to really take it easy before her next treatment.,
both of us heard the same thing last time she had chemo which was that for the first 6 days after treatment she needs to go into isolation to avoid contamination.,
so she did this even though she was feeling reasonable.,
the following week we had a play week when we went christmas shopping .,
"also lisa went out on her own to meet friends in town which was a very anxious time for me, a bit like sending her to her first day at school.",
in spite of a few panic attacks she managed it well and has made it a regular date now.,
however she dropped like a stone and was poorly from then onwards.,
we queried this with another oncologist who told us that it was days 7 to 14 which were her most vulnerable times and that she should keep herself to herself during that period - doh - in addition to her rock chic wig lisa now has a platignum white straight wig and seems to be going down the emo ( or is it chemo) route.,
ian is shaving his head today to raise money for force affiliated to macmillan.,
if you are interested in seeing the results you can look on the just giving web site next week where his page is : http://www.justgiving.com/ianjohnson6 we've had some great advice from people like you who have had experience of cancer and diabetes.,
i appreciate how difficult this must be for you as it must take you back to a bad time in your lives - how generous to do that for my girl.,
hope you are ok and looking forward to christmas - yes only 6 weeks away!!!!,
many thanks and positive thoughts to you all love annette hi there i have some good news.,
thanks for all your kind thoughts.,
"lisa had some great news this week - when she started her treatment just 8 weeks ago she was looking at chemo for 6 months followed by a mastectomy , more cancer cells in the other breast and cancer cells in the passages leading to her lymph glands.",
"she's had three treatments out of the 8 and has now had another scan which showed that the tumour has reduced by a massive 50%, the cancer cells in her other breast have cleared as have the cells in her lymph system.",
it now looks like as long as things progress in the same way there will be no mastectomy at the end of her chemo - what a boost to our spirits.,
"the doctors thought it was remarkable progress and asked what she was doing right , she told them about her diet regime and her rest/relaxation regime plus the sea bands and also that a large number of people were sending out positive thoughts and support for her.",
at last we're looking forward to the future ( cautiously though) and she's even planning for christmas.,
"of course nothing is ever completely plain sailing is it, lisa has started to feel a little queasy on a regular basis which is a little disapionting but she's coping.",
what she does find curious is that she is starving hungry all the time - have any of you come across this as side effect of chemo/diabetes ?,
"i hope all of you and your loved ones are doing well too onwards and upwards love annette really pleased to hear about anna, jane.",
i am sure having your support has been a factor in her progress.,
merry christmas to you both love annette hello everyone thank you so much for your kind messages and interest.,
things are progressing at a slow pace here and im afraid after all these weeks of fighting and staying positive weve hit a brick wall.,
im not sure what it is but a week or so after the euphoria of the good news from the scan lisas resolve dropped and shes feeling pretty low at the moment.,
i think it may be because the reality of the next long months of treatment has hit her and also the time of year can be pretty hard going for many people.,
"so, following karens advice, i will take all the help i can get.",
its lisas birthday on new years day and i want to make her a card with as many positive and uplifting messages in it as possible.,
im running out of things to say but i am sure that there are many of you who are able to pass on to lisa the thoughts that have inspired you at times of trouble.,
i will print them out and add them to her card so that she can take them out and read them when she is feeling low.,
meanwhile a huge hug to the powerful circle of friendship on this forum love from annette,
hi there i'd just like to ask is there anything i can try as my bloods go up as soon as my novorapid wears off.,
i do take lantus which helps my morning wake up bgl as i call them.,
i've been diagnosed type 1.5 for a year and a half now that's what i thought.,
the lantus should be keeping my levelish.,
i take 35 units at night and when i eat my novorapid is 2-3 units mostly.,
i wake at around 8-9s in the morning which is still a bit high but not worrying.,
after the novorapid when i've eaten i then go back up to 11-15s!,
got to ask what's a basal test?,
i get no support from my team they are awful.,
see a specialist every 6 months but nhs so gets cancelled all the time as no staff.,
any help i'd be very grateful daibell said: hi.,
that lantus dose is quite high (and the bolus quite low?).,
do you have excess weight?,
"if so, large levels of insulin may be needed due to insulin resistance which may explain why the lantus isn't working too well.",
if you do have excess weight and not low-carbing then do get the carbs down.,
click to expand...,
i'm at top of my bmi and docs aren't worried about my weight.,
if i use to much bolus i can tell i get low bgl.,
exercise is limited due to having fibromyalgia and hip problems caused from an accident.,
kristin251 said: do you mostly rise in the morning until mid afternoon or is after each meal?,
my basal dose is right but in the morning i have to take at least one more dose and most often even another or i keep rising.,
i can't take the full dose at once or i hypo then pop up.,
"after loads of testing, i take my food dose ( 1/2 unit) 10 minutes before i eat at 8 then 1/2 unit one hour later to stop the rise and then i test around noon and if i'm going up i take 1/2 unit again.",
this keeps me steady until i eat at 3 and then i'm steady until dinner at 6:30 but it took lots of testing to see when my rise started and i am able to catch it before it goes up.,
"that being said, i'm only taking 1/2 units so i don't fear hypos.",
i can't take more lantus or i hypo during the night.,
it's my version of a pump in the mornings.,
"i, just not ready for a pump yet.",
this is where i could see it being very advantageous for some people.,
many of us have trouble with dawn phenomenon and waking phenomenon in the mornings until mid day.,
if i didn't eat at 3 i would stay steady until dinner if i wanted to skip lunch ( but i don't) and not sure how long after as i always eat dinner.,
"click to expand... hey there, yeah mostly if not always after each meal.",
"i eat then take novorapid at 2-3 units and that works for 2.5 hours and straightaway they start rising it's like i need to take another 2 units soon as the other units wear off yeah exactly that, i'm steady till 2.5hours and then bang i test again and i'm at 12+ it's crazy.",
yeah if i took more i'd drop to low as i tried this a few times.,
never thought about the pump to be honest.,
what it is is that i was a heavy drinker for 10 plus years then decided to stop a couple years back and they noticed that i had high bgl so went straight on insulin.,
i sound very much the same as you so think i'll be trying that.,
thanks for your advice,
"hello, recently i have been doing random blood sugar level tests through a little machine that pricks my finger and gives a reading.",
as i understand 4.5 is a normal number to be at.,
"just before dinner today for no apparent reason my blood sugar level was 6.9, it has never been so high and is getting me worried.",
is that acceptable?,
i dont know but it makes me feel light headed.,
i had not eaten anything between lunch and dinner and my simple carb intake has been at the minimum so i have no idea how sugar is getting into my blood stream.,
"at the moment i do not know what is affecting me, maybe all the fruit that i eat in the evenings make me wake up in such a terrible way, i know fruit converts into sugar or something and my mouth is usually so dry in the mornings.",
"right now i feel light headed and my heart is beating kind of fast, this has been a usually occurrence for the past year or so.",
"i usually feel lazy and tired but i do push myself to get on the treadmill now and again, yesterday i managed 1 hour walking at an incline at 4mph.",
i am constantly trying to lose weight through healthy food and exercise but the weight just does not come off.,
i feel depressed and peed off at the moment because my weight is not coming off which im assuming is affecting my blood sugar levels.,
"i guess i just want some kind of confirmation that something is wrong with me, im pretty sure there is as my mother, father and brother are all diabetic.",
"i am thinking to monitor my blood sugar levels for 2 weeks and take the results to the doctor, or should i just book an appointment tomorrow?",
what do you guys think?,
re: should i go to see the doctor?,
or am i worrying for noth this morning my sugar levels were 6.1 after a 12 hour fast.,
i'm not going to go to the doctor for this as i know nothing will come of it.,
"i have decided to try a low gi diet from tesco's website, hopefully it makes me feel better and more active.",

i was just wondering if anyone else suffers this and has found a way/something to stop it happening?,
"i have intermittent claudication, neuropathy in my feet and vascular problems so must not have compression garments.",
should i shoot myself now or is there any hope to prevent future scrapes and all that comes with them.,
many thanks in advance for your advice/comments.,
"hello again thank you ""spender cat & freema"" for commenting, much appreciated your input.",
"however all i need to know is how to protect my legs physically to stop skin being scraped, wonder if there is anything i can wear or put on my legs to stop the scrapes.",
they can happen when putting socks or trousers on or my legs touching furniture without feeling it or anywhere just slightly touched on the legs.,
i have vascular problems therefore cannot have any type of compression to keep things on my legs.,
"my diabetes is well controlled, my endo was extremely pleased with my last results and actually commented i was his star patient (hmm lol).",
"i am tending to the latest scrapes using mepilex ag, mepore and trying to get them healed best i can.",
what i need to do after that is put something on them 24/7 (if possible) to prevent (hopefully) further scrapes.,
thanks in advance to anyone who may have experience of this problem and can advise what i may be able to do for protection.,
"energize said: i wonder if it would help you to cover your legs with doubled tubifast, but making sure it's a bit looser than normally fitted?",
it's much less elasticated than tubigrip and much more breathable fabric.,
"it comes on a roll, of varous lengths, so you can just cut of what you need.",
"depending on your build, there are several sizes to select from.",
"if you measure the circumference of your leg(s) where you would like to have the protection, or the larger circumference ie calf, then select the relevant size.",
"it does stretch, of course, but is very gentle.",
"having said that, if your socks/trousers cause your skin to shear, this may not be a solution.",
"tubifast - http://www.molnlycke.co.uk/wound-care-dressings/fixation-retention/tubifast/ you can buy it at one of the well-named internet shops, of course, and cheaper than town stores.",

any answer much appreciated and thanks in advance.,
thanks i will talk to my dr again today .,
my dr has changed me over to metabet sr once a day but i was on 2 metformin a day now i am worried if i will get any withdrawal symptoms because my routine was eat breakfast and take the metformin and then tea time eat ea and take the 2 nd now what do i do take in morning or tea time and do i still eat at the regular times?,
i started the sr last night this morning i'm feeling very sick don't feel like eating but have forced myself to have a few spoons of porridge and a cup of tea.i have taken 2 buscopan hope this sickly feeling goes soon.,
thanks all for your responses.,
would metformin make me ill like this for a month i feel terrible constantly feeling sick i could't eat ths morning i felt so sick.,

"thanks helse , i have lansozoprazole just wondering why feel like this now i been on the metforming about 6 months and was fine now i been like this a month can it just flare up like this?",
as far as i can remember the only thing i did change was tablets for arthritis because the usual ones stopped working so the dr prescribed different ones.,
hi came across this diet...am sceptical so looked on this forum for feedback and review...to date havent come across any discussion.,
i am sure that there has been some commentary just cant find it.,
if any kind person can point me to it i would be very greatful.,

"once you've done that, you need to start working out the best way of managing it and keeping it under control.",

also past 3 days i have no appetite at all which is unused for me as i usually eat a lot.,
nauseated too and just very tired and thirsty.,
anyone any advise?,
my so wanted to go to hospital but i refused.,
"catladynz said: the loss of appetite, nausea, tiredness and thirst could be a viral infection or hyperglycaemia.",
if you had a home blood glucose meter it would be very useful to know what your bg is.,
the blurred vision is likely to be related to having had high bg for a while and making a sharp drop in bg.,
best thing to do is wait and see what happens over the next few days and weeks.,
are there any medications you have started recently?,
i don't know what the pins and needles and ringing in the ears mean.,
i'm sure your doctor will be able to tell what is going on.,
"try not to worry too much at this stage, but if you feel worse then please do go to the hospital or get some medical help right away.",
"keep eating low carb, as this will help bring your bg down.",
click to expand...,
"i checked my bg and it was 3.4 so i ate a peach, only thing i could stomach, and it's up to 5.4 now.",
no new medications.,
as for lose of appetite it never happened before even when i had pneumonia lol.,
so it is pretty strange to me.,
i just feel so tired.,
defo going to doctor tomorrow just to easy my mind.,
thank you i have seen my gp last week and he said i am not diabetic as my 2h pp glucose was lower than my fasting so my body can handle sugar.,
they were till high tho.,
13.5 fasting and 11.9 2h pp.,
"i will test before going to bed, i tested now and it's down to 4....",
i will check again in hour and if it's falls down again i may take that trip to hospital.,
i am just feeling strange... started getting this weird feeling all over my body like a cold sensation and numbness...,
i definitely be getting a second opinion.,
seeing a reproductive endocrinologist next week due to infertility and an endocrinologist some time in october so i will defo be asking them for opinions.,
my gp said that fertility people will.probably stick me on metformin anyways to help with pco i got new lenses on medical card so didn't have to pay.,
i had to get new ones cos i couldn't see with my old ones at all due to dramatic change.,
in last 3 days i haven't been eating much.,
just no interest in eating.,
"but i have had tomatoes and scrabbled eggs, chicken breast and spinach, sugar free yogurts, meatballs, some cheese and sugar free jelly.",
the jelly is really the only thing that i wanted to eat.,
that's all i had over last 3 days.,
i am off to doctors guys i will update you when i know something.,
bg this morning was 2.5 had some toast and is up to 6 now.,
my eyes got worse today for few mins after i woke up my vision wouldn't focus on anything at all and everything seemed really dark got sent to hospital urgently as my doctor thinks there might be a problem with a clot or circulation he mentioned it could be raise in pressure in my skull again.,
hopefully they will figure something out and finally deal with title rather than leave it be,
"sorry to be a pain but my feet and ankles are very swollen, my feet are solid and feel like they may burst open at any minute.",
should i be worried?,
thank you in advance sent from my 5017x using diabetes.co.uk forum mobile app thank you all for advice sent from my 5017x using diabetes.co.uk forum mobile app,
these were the words used by my doctor yesterday.,
i was diagnosed as type2 in march and had a whole lot of tests.,
since then i have been sent for 2 blood tests but only found out last week that neither of these included hba1c test.,
so i have been asked to change my diet etc radically but they haven't checked my blood sugar since.,
"in shock, i asked for a monitor so i could check my own level.",
that was the response.,
do i ignore this and buy the equipment myself?,
thank you all.,
catladynz my levels were apparently just over the threshold at 50 mmol.,
she gave this as one reason why testing was not needed more than every 6 months.,
"however, as i am diet only i am concerned about what happens at times like christmas where my diet control will not be so strict.",
thanks daisy1.,
that's very helpful.,
i quoted nice to my doctor yesterday but she would not move from her stance that i did not need to test.,
i will buy a monitor as i need to know what affect foods have.,
her testing every 6 months is not enough.,
"if i can control my levels through diet, i can postpone the need for medication as long as possible.",
meter and strips ordered.,
this may seem a silly question but how will i safely dispose of used lancets?,
does anyone have issues with kidney function and still successfully follow the lchf regime?,
"although i am not being treated as such!, i.e.",
"dialysis, i've been told my kidneys do not work at full capacity and have deteriorated significantly over the last couple of years.",
i am a little worried about what i have read about ketosis affecting the kidneys.,
is it just a case of drinking lots of water?,
should i take the issue up with my gp or renal consultant?,
thank you for this advice.,
i have only been on the lchf diet for 2 days so far.,
already my blood sugars have stabilised so that's a good start.,
"so far my diet has consisted of eggs, bacon, burgers, broth, cheese, double cream, nuts and berries.",
i dont feel at all hungry most of the time.,
of course its too early to tell if there is any weight loss.,
"so far i have not had any negative feedback re this diet although i saw my dietician yesterday and she wouldn't endorse it s andbreathe said: if i recall @ferguscrawford experienced an improvement in his ckd, whilst on such an eating regime.",
"@ferguscrawford - looking at your profile, i might have made that bit up, so apologies if that's the case.",
"if i have, do you know who i might have got you confused with?",
click to expand...,
sounds encouraging.,
i'm just a worry wart about everthing thank you.,
that's a weight off my mind ferguscrawford said: guilty as charged on lower carbs lower/med protein higher fat.,
click to expand... could you give me an idea of what types of food you would eat which are high in fat.,
"thanks ol ferguscrawford said: nuts, whole yoghurt, whole milk, don't trim fat from meat, avocado,real mayonnaise butter(not marg) nut oils in dressings.",
"i don't load with fats, i just don't remove them!",
click to expand... ok thanks for that.,
"that's helpful spiker said: lchf should be fine but watch the protein, as others have said.",
"the only evidence that high dietary protein causes kidney problems (a common anti-atkins scare story) is for people with pre-existing kidney problems, as you have.",
but go high fat and you should be fine.,
click to expand... ok i'll watch the meat consumption then.,
i love eggs but better be careful with those too,
"hi to all, i've been reading some research papers that claim type 2 diabetes hypos are tied to aggression.",
i fully appreciate that someone can be irritable and may even lose their temper in a hypo but i find it hard to believe that someone experiencing a hypo can be aggressive.,
after all to be aggressive you'd need at least normal if not high blood sugars.,
what do other people think?,
kyrani hi everyone and thanks for all your information.,
i still have some problems in understanding this.,
in a hypo there is low blood sugar and to become aggressive as to bash someone up it takes a lot of energy which means there has to be glucose there to have enough energy to become physical.,
i can understand if the person has a sudden rage and uses up their blood sugars too rapidly that they would end up with a hypo.,
but i can't see how having a hypo causes aggression and even if adrenalin is involved because it still does not account for the low blood glucose.,
adrenalin alone is not enough to be able to engage is strong physical activity.,
the person has to have energy so they need enough blood glucose.,
the dawn phenomenon has adrenalin involvement but there we see high blood glucose.,
adrenalin stimulates the liver to dump sugar.,
i can understand that high level of insulin may be involved but even then the aggression / rage has to come first not the hypo.,
does anyone know if any continuous glucose monitoring has been done at the time a hypo was experienced?,
kyrani.,
"jaylee said: yes, but unfortunately all the equipment & the data collated was destroyed... click to expand...",
interesting!,
why was that done?,
"yes there is a store -glycogen in the muscles, and it can be used to perform some actions, moving hands and feet around etc., and even that would tax their glucose supplies.",
the papers i read seem to be trying to suggest that diabetes could be a violent menace to the public owing to hypos and that is outrageous.,
"they are trying to say if you go hungry then you get aggro so if the body goes hungry, i.e., a hypo then the body gets aggro.",
it is still not equal aggression.,
the adrenalin/ fight or flight response does not automatically translate to violence.,
"panic attacks, anxiety attacks both, with normal blood glucose don't translate to violence.",
"and furthermore i can't go with the ""man is a machine"" paradigm of the medicos.",
"i strongly suspect that were a humane person commits violence there has to have been a reason, provocation, threat, violation of themselves or their property.",
the idea that it is just a machine malfunction is imo garbage.,
i can understand a hypo in the case of t1 because they have to carefully monitor their insulin levels and if they suffer some stress the insulin would quickly get used up but that doesn't make them violent monsters.,
"in t2 also there has to have been a reason for the depletion, possibly the liver supply low so it is not being replenished in the blood fast enough.",
and some drugs do cause problems.,
i found that both worry and depression also cause insulin resistance and maybe even the production of insulin reduced a bit.,
but low insulin means hyper not hypo.,
hello this is my first post.,
"i have recently be told that my hba1c had come back at 55 and that i was type 2 diabetic, on a random blood check at the doctors my levels were 9 after 2.5 hours of eating.",
since then i have bought a monitor and my levels range from 10.5 up to 25.,
was put on metaformin 1 week later had a fasting blood test and its come back at 5.9 within normal range.,
"so im confused do i have diabetes or not now that test is normal, due to see doctor again monday.",
i am also currently on steroids treating a crohns flair up.,
"i have had symptoms of sweating, shaking intense hunger and peeing a lot in the night, all b with headache when levels are high and just a general feeling of being unwell.",
has anyone got any experience with one test saying diabetes the other being normal?,
thanks in advance,
my gp gave me a print out of my last blood test.,
"i need some help to understand the cholesterol results, this is what it says on the paper.",

how are my ratios and are they good or bad?,
what do i need to do if it is bad?,
"thanks thanks for these responses, i feel much happier about resisting my gps offer of statins now.",
"the numbers are on the way down and the dietary chages i've made will probably improve the figures overall feel free to chip in, witsum.",
"i have learned loads here and, ideally understand enough to ask the questions i need to ask to get things under my control and as far as i can see, more questions lead to more understanding.",
i'm not good at the medical model :?,
"especially as ""normal"" seems to equal male as oh-so-many of teh clinical trials are done on men :?",

"one of my oracles on womens health is the boston womens health book collective, who wrote the classic women's health book ""our bodies ourselves"" - there was a uk version published in the 1980s (updated in 96) which i still dip in to now.",

http://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/book/ ... .asp?id=65 my diabetes was picked up by my gp at the end of january when i had some chest pain and i was referred to the chest pain clinic at my local hospital after taking several fingerfuls of blood for testing.,
i was tested thoroughly by the clinic and i don't have any early signs of heart disease.,
the chest pain was a combination of a panic attack (living on unacceptable levels of stress) and muscle pain.,
"hi all, currently on novomix 30 3 times a day (used to be twice).",
just had my latest hba1c and it has gone up to 8.7% from 8.0% last time - been hovering around 8.5% for the last 12 months or so.,
seeing my diabetes nurse on monday and she has suggested (on the phone) that it might be a good idea to try going on to basal/bolus.,
"not really looking forward to adding in yet another injection but can anyone who has moved from novomix 30 to lantus / novorapid let me know how they found it, how their control was affected and how quickly did they see any change in their hba1c results?",
thanks steven (type 2 - or possibly 1.5!,

did you experience more/less hypos (hypers?),
when you changed?,
at the moment i have around 3 hypos per week but it can be better or worse in phases :?,
"thanks steven totsy said: hya steven, i still have the odd blips, the main thing was finding out what my ratio was as i was told to start at 10g carbs to one unit novorapid, obviously if u exercise are busy then take a bit less but once you get the hang of it its so much better, id say after first few wks you will be spot on click to expand... hi again, are you saying that carb counting is essential for novorapid or were you doing that anyway before you changed to it?",
"i've never done that myself, although i have found that i need to adjust how much novomix i inject depending on what i'm eating - anywhere between 18 and 32 units at tea time for example!",
"it is partly guesswork on my part though and i sometimes over or under estimate, hence the hypos or high readings i get thanks steven chocoholic said: i used to be on novomix30 and am now on lantus/novorapid.i think totsy and i both changed over at a similar time.",
"initially, i found it tricky but i seem to have settled into it okay now.as totsy says, finding your correct ratio is the thing that needs time to adjust to.i still don't seem to havemy novorapid spot on but i'm getting there and am glad i made the change.the extra jabs don't concern me now but it does offer a little more flexibility with your food, so i'm sure you'll find it beneficial.",
"click to expand... hi, thanks for that, i'm almost looking forward to seeing my dsn on monday!",
:lol: can you tell me where i can find out more about the gad test please?,
for example is it like a normal blood test but they just check for different things?,
do you have to have it done at a hospital?,
what does it involve exactly?,
sorry about all the questions - found out a lot in the last few days but want to learn more!,
"cheers steven totsy said: hya, yes with novorapid you have to carb count, but dont worry it is easy once u know how,if u fancy a chat about it let me know click to expand... hi totsy, yeah, it would be good to find out more about how you do the carb counting and adjust your novorapid etc.",
- i'm seeing my dsn on monday but the appointment is only 30 mins long!,
"chocoholic said: the gad test, if i remember correctly, was just done from normal blood test asked for my specialist.i just got a 'positive' result.",

click to expand...,
"thanks, that's useful info the more i read about lada, the more convinced i am that i'm one too.",
i'm definitely going to mention it to my dsn on monday and ask if i can possibly have gad and/or c-peptide tests done.,
i can only ask can't i?,
oh btw i mentioned type 1.5 to my gp on tuesday and he had never heard of it!,
he's supposed to be a diabetes specialist gp but i've always been convinced that i know far more than he does :shock: update: saw my dsn today and i'm changing to basal/bolus!,
had my first injection of novorapid (8 units) at tea time and will be having my lantus (18 units) at supper time (probably about 10:30 p.m.,
i think).,
asked about counting carbs - she didn't exactly say it was compulsory but will be passing my details onto a dietitian to go through it with me i think!,
will start off having 6 units at breakfast and dinner and 8 units with my tea and see how it goes - will check bs more often and speak to her later in the week once things have settled down asked about the gad test - she said they're sent to oxford(?),
"to be done and cost money (the practice maybe, not sure?)",
and advised me to speak to my gp about having one done.,
not sure whether to bother just yet or not :?,
cheers steven,

i wish i could get him on my side with going to the doctors and stuff but i know i'm 20 years old i should be able to handle this on my own... head is fucking pounding now :'( sent from the diabetes forum app thanks andy.,
i hate the idea of upsetting my parents because they pull the whole 'we've put up with you and your issues for 20 years and you live under our roof' guilt trip.,
and shout.,
and get physical.,
then they argue with eachother about whose fault it is that i came out screwed up i will make a nuisance of myself at the surgery tomorrow.,
the first dr i emailed about my numbers asked me to check for ketones (as protocol) and i didn't have them at the time.,
now that i do he might listen.,
"though it makes no sense as my bg is not sky high, my hba1c is normal i'm told.",
"haven't got much of a leg to stand on beside my recordings and photos of dipstick tests/bg meter readings, but of course they are asking why the hell i am testing my own blood and urine anyway.",
i will try...thanks everyone...,
sent from the diabetes forum app hi guys an update.,
i have mixed feelings about today's appointment.,
"an ogtt has been ordered, but like i said i cope better with lucozade than food for some odd reason.",
maybe because of rate of absorption vs the rate my body can catch up with insulin.,
the gp had to actually go look up the diagnostic criteria for diabetes on the internet and sat there reading going 'oh isn't this interesting' for 20 minutes.,
"he was perplexed, i had to answer his questions for him.",
he phoned another doctor and said 'if you could tell me the difference between ifg and igt and all this nonsense you'd be an angel'.,
i could tell him that.,
he also struggled to spell my email address which is a very common latin word.,
"ok so i did 3 years of latin, but shouldn't a doctor be able to recognise the name of a common species when he must come across latin in his medical training?",
it's a nice compliment but it makes me worry when i tell him things and he goes 'you're so clever!',
when he's the one with the qualifications @_@ as far as he's concerned anything under 11.1 after the ogtt is absolutely fine and he wont look at my case any further.,
he said my high blood sugar spikes were intriguing and seemed to think it was really cool and started wondering about how many *perfectly normal* people spike to nearly 20.,
after half a bag of crisps.,
"what the **** he was going to refer me to a specialist because he had no idea how an ogtt is performed, but after looking it up on the internet and asking another doctor he decided to do it at the surgery.",
if he sends me home and cannot explain my crazy bg swings and spikes i give up.,
"i officially will stop caring, stop testing and what happens to me happens to me...",
"sent from the diabetes forum app the gp also repeatedly misquoted my numbers as lower than stated when consulting another doctor, so think i will email him this.",
someone please tell me i am not paranoid or crazy or a hypochondriac...,
this isn't normal or healthy is it?,
"i am seeing these sorts of numbers more and more frequently yet he says, smirking, 'i think there isn't a problem at all' he said its because 'artistic types' are probably too analytical.",
all in my head not sure what else to do.,
i can't go to a and e unless it's an emergency.,
unless i call them and explain the situation and find out if there is a way of referring myself to an endo.,
"or use my diagnosis of polysyctic ovarian syndrome as that is an endocrine disorder i have received no advice, treatment or support for.",
"sent from the diabetes forum app janeecee said: no, don't give up!",
keep your diet under control as best you can.,
if you are 7.8-11.0 you will at least be tested annually and the long term goal is to stop progression regardless of doctors etc.,
sent from the diabetes forum app click to expand...,
i won't.,
they have not heard of any such thing as prediabetes or a prediabetes range.,
he had not heard of igt or ifg and could not understand the difference when looking them up on the internet.,

"i have just traipsed down to the surgery and got told yes, that will cost 30.",
"i am astounded, i asked to speak to the practice manager who said it is classed as a 'private' letter.",
"ok, i suppose i can understand that but 30 quid?",
what a con.,
"i won't be paying that so my question is, has anyone got any suggestions what else to take with me just in case i need to prove anything?",
"thanks to you all, some good advice and very much appreciated,",
"hi all, not been on for a while, no excuse really just been busy.... my levels are a little higher than usual the last few days, i have put it down too eating a little more than i usually do, still good though, but today having a great food day my levels are above 8, i hate this.",

"saturday night we were out in garden chatting with friends and neighbours till late and i got bit a few times on my leg, now red patches and very itchy.",
i have been using savlon on them.,
"i read somewhere that bug bites could cause higher blood glucose levels, what do you think?",
or is it savlon?,
should i see doc or will it go and be ok?,
thanks they are not so much itchy today but they are big red blotches about 1/2 inch wide.,
i think maybe horseflies as we took a walk next to the canal on saturday.,
now that the biteshavibf stopped itching so much my levels have gone down back towards my normal levels.,
"i definatley think it's the bites causing it, got a couple being itchy today and my levels are up again and i have been super low carbing so food is not the cause.",
it's making me a little moody too.,
*sigh* sid bonkers said: no idea about the raised bg level but a couple of things that might help generally.,
"first take some antihistamine the next time you are bitten as you seem to be getting a bad reaction to the bites, i get a similar reaction and take a piriton tablet and it helps a lot, seems to work for me.",
"secondly buy some avon skin so soft moisturising cream, biting insects hate it and will leave you alone, i'm not kidding it works really well its an old fishing tip :thumbup: alternatively buy some insect repellent that contains deet, a product called jungle formula used to work for me.",
both these work but the avon cream is kinder on the environment and your skin.,

"thanks, missis has some piriton or something for her hay fever, might look at that.",
as far as i know i don't have diabetes.,
all my blood tests are always good etc.,
"i usually eat low glycemic index foods, i don't eat processed foods and i don't add sugar or sweeteners to anything.",
i don't eat lots of fruits either.,
"i just started a liver cleanse protocol, that involves a diet with no fats at all and 1 liter of apple juice a day (yes, insane).",
"anyway, after drinking the apple juice i feel dizzy and light headed.",
"could it be because i am not ""used"" to sugars or does it mean i am pre-diabetic or diabetic?",
rather than carry jelly babies and lucozade i'm thinking about dextro energy tablets.,
nice and small and easily carried.,
"has anyone tried them, and if so how many should i take in the (unlikely) event of a hypo.",
dave many thanks to everyone for your replies.,
i'll try to get old of some glucotabs.,
"andbreathe said: miahara, how close do you feel you have been to a hypo?",
are you taking any hypo inducing meds?,
"although i have experienced very low numbers, and do quite regularly, i have never knowingly had a hypo.",
i don't carry anything with me.,
"the odd time i've felt very hungry and quite, quite empty, it has usually been in the run up to a meal (i don't snack).",
"if my meal is imminent, i wait it out.",
"if my meal is a bit further off, i'll have a cup of tea, with some milk in, which just gives my system something to be working on until my food arrives.",
"as a healthy, unmedicated t2, i believe my liver will look after me, by releasing some of it's stores.",

"i'm on gliclazide, a sulphonylurea that can cause hypos.",
so far i've only experienced one and that was in exceptional circumstances and largely due to eating very little all day and what i did finally eat was very low carb followed by a couple of glasses of wine.,
this was last summer after flying out to greece.,
"my normal bg lows are in the 5+ to upper 6 range, though yesterday after a rather chaotic day with no 'normal' meals i felt unusually knackered by evening and when i tested was 4.6.",
i'm not unduly worried about hypos and just want something that's handier than a bottle of lucozade or bag of jelly babies to carry around.,
having said that i am steadily reducing my bg and have been told i could be classed as 'in remission' if it continues so will need to watch that the meds and diet don't drive it too low.,
dave,
"good morning i have my first meter and want to do my firat test could you help please,i have my first 3 month assestment on thursday but would like to begin testing to day,i am very nervouse and suffer from chronic anxiety,what has prevented me from doing this before is that i am worried that my original blood test hasn't changed with my low carb diet and exercise,it is the sd codefree neter full of bits and pieces ,thank you sorry about the questions but is this worth buying.",
thank you my friends but all i keep getting is e-!,
"error showing just took my first meter test i am a little dissapointed as it read 10.1 morning and thank you for all your kind and friendly support,i forgot that as every morning i had porridge and bluberries about 2 hours before that,and i have already used 7 strips(6 messed up) and only have 3 left what a plonker i am.",
"gooafternoon all my friends i have just taken another test and the reading is 5.1, but only one test strip left",
has anyone heard of this reversal program by david andrews??,
any opinions on it?,
i have high insulin resistance and i am currently on no medications.,
how many carbs should i eat a day to lose weight weekly.,
my diet is mostly protein and low carb right now.,
also does fat cause trouble with insulin?,
"i wanted to try keto because i heard from one source that eating fat helps you burn fat quicker, but from another source they said that fat is a problem for insulin resistance people.",
anyone with experience in this that has lost weight?,
hi i'm type 2 and recently i have been suffering from a tight foreskin which will not pull back over the head.,
does anyone else suffer from this and if so how did u treat it,
i am interested to know how long it takes to become diabetic.,
i was diagnosed dec 2011 and my hba1c was 9%.,
is it likely i was diabetic a few years prior to that or can it happen over a period of months?,
can any one shed more light on the recent new findings on metformin.,
it seems that a new study has found that metformin causes the heart metabolism in men to move in an undesirable direction.,
the heart burns less sugar and more fats.,
"the chronic burning of fat by the heart leads to detrimental changes in the heart muscle,which can lead to heart failure.",
"instead of making the heart metabolism more normal in men, metformin alone made it worse, looking even more like a diabetic heart.",
"in women the it has the desired effect,lowering fat metabolism and increasing glucose uptake by the heart.",
but they have also found that taking viagra every few months halves the risk of men who have type 2 diabetes dying from heart problems.,
i am prediabetic though my last ha1c test was down to 37.,
i am not going to be complacent though because i still see myself as potentially diabetic.,
"i never did eat a lot of chocolate or sugary foods, though i was a pasta and pie fan.",
i maybe ate a pudding once a month and it would be something and custard.,
i did like cheesecake but even then only an occasional slice every few weeks.,
"all that said, it wasn't until i was told i was prediabetic and altered my diet that i realised how many things i was missing.",
i still do because i am trying to stick to low carb higher fat.,
"for some strange reason i long for a bar of chocolate; not the 70% and above cocoa solids kind, but a common old bar of something.",
i would love a crumble and custard.,
so far i haven't succumbed to these yearnings but i can't see me going much longer without something very sweet....something ordinary and 'normal'.,
what i wanted to ask is: who has a guilty secret?,
"( not any more if you reply to this) if you crack once in a while, what is it that you go for?",
sweet stuff?,
pastry?,
other white carbs like baked potatoes?,
cath99 said: chips .... lol x but havnt since diagnosed i do squash ones now if i have the craving x click to expand... must try those!,

it's a bit like having your rights taken away from you.,
"popsy said: awww i know but honestly hon, is it worth the ill health?",
or all the appalling side effects that diabetes can inflict on you?,
i can see that you are taking your diagnosis as being prediabetic seriously from the amount of msgs you have posted.,
you want to know about your condition and if you are careful you may be able to avoid being full blown diabetic for ages.,
"now that is a gift i never had, i had overeaten all my life, my diabetes is a direct result of that and it was due really to ignorance.",
"the reasons for my overeating addiction aren't important any more and to be honest, i have never felt better in my life since being diagnosed as diabetic how crazy is that?",
i honestly know where you are coming from though but it may be useful to look at this from another angle.,
"if you are low carbing then a whole huge new world of food experimentation is open to you, but i know it takes a lot of adjustment brainwise to change habits but i can see that aren't pretending that this isn't happening to you, you have confronted it and you will conquer this.",
my only useful strategies for avoiding stuff i am better off not having are to walk away.,
"literally that, just walk away.",
"divert yourself, find something else to do.",
you gotta retrain your brain!,
"doesn't really help though does it when that overwhelming craving hits....never mind, it's just another bump in the road and you will get over this one too.",
good luck sjc click to expand...,
thanks i know it will be worth it.,
i just wondered who does crack occasionally and what with particularly.,
i think it's a bit of angry rebellion sometimes to defy the diagnosis.,
"those of you on low carb diet, can i ask roughly how many carbs a day you have.",
what foods do you eat that contain them?,
"can i also ask , what is a spike?",
obviously it's not a good thing and it's when the bs leaps high but by how much and for how long?,
"if i have a small bowl of porridge, semi skimmed milk and nothing else, 2 hours later my bs goes up two eg 6.2 upto 8.2.",
must admit i haven't got round to seeing what it is 3 hours later.,
is this ok or not?,
i use porridge as an example.,
slowly getting to grips with it all but still have gaps in my learning.,
hi sue thanks for that .,
i might try testing an hour after some foods as well as two hours.,
see what shows up.,
sue what is a good level to be 2 hours after eating compared to just before?,
"or put another way, when should i be concerned with a bs level after food?",
hope that made sense.,
"ps can i ask in the nicest way, do you sit there all day waiting to pounce on the next question that appears so you can help solve it for us?",
"you do a fantastically, amazingly, stupendous job.",
thank you.,
thanks sue.,
"hi, i am 19 and i wear removable braces.",

"hi group, i was wondering if anybody knows or has any experience in regard to t3 (thyroid hormone replacement) and its affects on blood glucose/insulin.",
"the reason i ask if i have alot of problems going on, thyroid/adrenals/diabates and they are all linked in some way or another.",
but it seems recently when i have been increasing my t3 to quite a high dose i think its having some affect on either my blood glucose or insulin or both ?,

"i also posted on a thyroid forum and we kind of came to the conclusion that it didnt, but it may do indirectly if you happen to be on adrenal support aswell (hydrcortisone) hi fallenstar, im on t3 only (cytomel) were as armor is t4/t3 combo and thyroxine being t4 only.",
but like you i felt soooo much better on my thyroid tablets but now the steroids are taking a bad affect on me with my blood glucose levels.,
"i still need to be on steroids but im starting to wean down off them now as they are causing my diabetes symptoms to worsen, ive still not gottan an official diagnosis but my appoint with doc is next tuesday but its looking like im heading down thwe type 2 route, will probably use metformin + diet and see how i go from there fallenstar said: hi hendie could i ask are you on armour ?",
and have you found your insulin needs going up since treating your thyroid problems.,
"i know the steroids really level out my blood sugars and stop the bad lows, i also feel great on them but they are supposed to cause high blood sugars .",
how do you feel on the steroids?,
i'm on thyroxine and have found my blood sugars a bit all over since i have taken this.....but i feel sooooo much better on it click to expand... jen&khaleb said: khaleb is on thyroxin for his lack of thyroid function (auto immune attack).,
i am always seriously warned if the dose goes up that he could be prone to hypo.,
when he first started on the thyroxin he had some low levels and i didn't give him any fast acting insulin with a few meals.,
after a week or so everything settled down and insulin levels went back to normal.,
click to expand... are you saying that khaleb's blood glucose levels lowered when he first started t4 (thyroxin) do you think it may be due to the extra insulin prodcuded by the body ?,
"hi again fallenstar for me i had conversion problems, i could not convert t4 to the active hormone of t3... either due to low adrenal reserves or low iron at the time or most probably both.",
"i have tried t4 only, then t4/t3 and then i went onto t3 only (which i have to order myself as a private doctor suggested it) very few endos are open to t3/t4 and especially not t3 only.",
"if t4 works for you great then stick with it, if it stops working you need to try and find out why whats stopping the conversion and its usually adrenals or iron.",
"i have been on steroids for over a year now (hydrocortisone) and yes i have thought similar to yourself, but the diet/exercise just isnt enough at the moment, so maybe metformin until i can wean off the steroids and then fingers crossed my diabates comes alot more under control.",
"if you are interested i can give you a link to a yahoo group im a member of, its for people with underactive thyroids and who are having trouble with their doctors/endo's when t4 only is not working for them.",
hendie fallenstar said: hi hendie thanks for the info that is very helpful to me.,
"now, on the thyroxine my tsh is still a bit on the boarderline high, for my liking anyway!",
"my t4 is on the high side but my free t3 is still on the low side , so i'm still kicking out the tsh to get more t3 but it is raising my t4 a bit too much.....a common problem i read with the thyroxine.",
"that is why i'm very interested in the armour because i would like my t3 in better range, even though i'm pretty much asymptomatic now (i was very poorly) i still think i could benefit from the important thyroxine (t'3) at cell level ....that is the one that gives us the energy.",
i have mentioned the armour to my endo but he say's it is complicated having to use it at intervals throughout the day and will just monitor me and to him he is happy with my numbers.,
"i'm cool with interval's, :wink: that's what we do with insulin....so i won't let it lie, if i start to feel bad again i'm onto it..no matter what my labs say :evil: i will ask about cytomel that sound like it could be the fella for me!",
could i ask hendie what your lab figures were ?,
if you know them for the thyroid function test's.,
were you just lacking in t'3?,
did that cause your tsh to be high?,
"as to answer your question on my blood sugar control since being on the thyroxine , i would honestly say yes it has changed and probably overall i would say it has become more erratic, unstable than anything.",
but i feel a thousand time's better than i did so again it is a trade off.,
"if anything it has made me more insulin sensitive , as i don't produce any and am very sensitive to insulin at cell level then it has been more difficult to control overall on the thyroxine.",
"i would think you would hopefully find this also that maybe you get better control ie, need less/or no medication to keep your bg in a good range.",
fingers crossed.,
the steroids are a whole different ball game :wink: i think they do higher bg but for me when i have been on them i'm as stable as anything because they dull the insulin sensitivity i have...probably because they give me the cortisol i'm lacking which is a hormone that raises blood sugar naturally ..it's one of the fight or flight one's and stress ones.,
so it will raise your bg hendie and i'm sure when you are off them you will find a huge difference.,
i hope so then you may not need to treat the diabetes beyond diet and exercise.,
how long have you been on the steroids?,
"hey jen yes thyroxine speeds up the metabolism , so overall you are supposed to need less insulin, but i'm glad things have settled down.",
all meds seem to effect bg even if it's for a short period of time and it does not state they do.,
click to expand...,
"i dont mind replying on here if thats oky with you and the forum mods, maybe down the line it could help someone using the search funtion with some information ect ect yes all my thyroid labs were in range so my gp was like i dont care about your symptoms they must be in your head as your labs are fine.... how wrong he could of been!",
"so i went down the private route to see dr peatfield (he has had his licence removed for treating people with t4/t3 and also hc, very long story but probably the best thyroid doctor in the uk) i do so much reading also to learn about my illness and find out information!",
"the reason im taking steroids was due to low adrenal resverves, which i did a 24 hour saliva test and i was under range for all of them, so started off on 25mg of hc the improvement was immense at first, but now im on a higher dose and its affecting my blood sugar.",
if your not converting t4 > t3 very well as you say your ft3 is bottom of the range then it could be converted into rt3 which blocks the cells from recieveing the t3.,
thre best thing to do if you have not already is get your adrenals checked out (24 saliva cortisol test from genova) and ask your gp for a full iron panel and make sure they are all within the acceptable range.,
its crazy but thyroid/adrenals/diabates are all linked and it a can be a bit scary when they all go out of wack!,
"here is the link to the thyroid website http://www.tpa-uk.org.uk/ and you can join the forum from the left hand side link ""discussion forum"" hendie fallenstar said: hendie yes the dr's are reluctant to treat hypothyroid full stop over here in my experience.",
the levels they want people to be at in the us is a lot lower than our levels.,
"what they consider to be an acceptable tsh level over here, even if a patient is chronically symptomatic is not treated over here if the labs are boarder line.",
"our boarder line figure's of tsh is classed as severely under active in the us, as i'm sure you already know, it's a nightmare :evil: ....so i know all about trying to get treated for thyroid problems over here and it sounds like you had the same problem...so you ended up going the private route?",
i would still like to get my thyroid labs in better ranges but like you i also have adrenal problems so that would explain why i have trouble with my t'3 level.,
"could i ask why you have been on the steroids, if you don't want to say on the public forum you could pm me.",
it sounds like we have some similar problems.,
i have been on and off the steroids and can see in the future probably being on them permanently which to be honest i think will stable my diabetes and improve my thyroid function....time will tell :wink: yes hendie pass on the link that would be good.,
"i did do a lot of reading during my poorly days with the thyroid as i was so desperate to get better, i may have seen the forum but if you would pass it on that would be a help as i really feel that if i get no joy as time goes on in getting my levels to how i'm sure will make me feel on a more even keel, then i will probably have to go the same route as yourself and seek a private consultation.",
"pm me if you want click to expand... hi again fallenstar, im afraid the short synathen test is a load of rubbish for diagnosis on low adrenal reserves as it only tells the extreameties (addisons were you have pretty much 0 cortisol, and then cushings were your producing too much cortisol.)",
"i think a saliva or possibly urine as the best to emasure adrenal reserves but quite a few endos say they are not but they also say that if ur labs are in range its not thyroid lol yeh i think the blood sugars are my problem at the moment, the thyroid and adrenal side of things i feel quite well, but the blood sugars its mainly spikes that are making me feel rubbish and feeding the yeast also 10+ from eating a few carbs.",
"my adrenal problems probably was quite weak most of my life, i always struggled to get out of bed in the mornings and was quiet tried throyghout life.",
"but then when i started to party around the age of 16/17 and i also had alot of mercury fillings (which slow down the conversion of t4>t3, ive now got all white ones) that my adrenals just started to pack up which then caused my thryoid to not be able to enter the cells.",

am i allowed to drink wine?,
2,
what is considered excessive?,

"thank you all so much, i'm not an alcoholic but after giving up everything else i enjoy, it's nice to know i can indulge every so often.",
x haven't had any problems with red wine since taking 2 x 500 metformin/day.,
"i always make sure i eat whilst drinking, maybe that helps!",
i would say keep practising,
i've been no carb pretty much 5 days now and on meds....my blood sugars have been a lot better in the last 2 days i had blurred vision when looking at my phone and reading labels....like i can't focus.,
is this normal as blood sugars change?,
is it normal to have trouble focusing?,
like double vision when reading this site?,
thanks.,
i notice it more at night....when i took my bs a few times it was around 95.,
"hi i have recently been diagnosed as being diabetic, and am finding the information that i am receiving from various different sources very confusing and was hoping that somebody may be able to help me clarify this particular point that is my latest confusion, i saw a dietician at my local doctors soon after i was diagnosed around 3 months ago that told me to take note of the labels on food in particular the amount of sugar that is released from the carbohydrates per 100g ,they gave me a chart that shows what is considered to be low sugar ( below 5g per 100g / medium ( between 5 - 15g per 100g ) and high (15g and over) so i have been focusing on trying to consume foods that fall into the low category and not paying much attention to the actual count of carbohydrates per 100g thinking that if they don't sugar then i don't need to worry about them, however i have now started a 6 week awareness course at a specialist clinic run by the local health authority and have been led to believe that all carbohydrates will turn to sugar making my previous system and advice redundant , this means that i would be better of eating doritos with 55g or carbs per 100g than ryvita with 66g per 100g .so in summary my question becomes ,is it the total carbs per 100g or just the (of which sugars) that is important ?",
or is it both,
"as i have become better at managing my diet, my bg has steadily fallen.",
as of this evening my pre dinner reading was 4.5 and has been reducing almost every day.,
i'm concerned it might continue to fall.,
i'm on 3 x 500 mg metformin per day.,
so my question is do i need to do something to stop my bg from falling too low.,
is it a simple matter of eating more?,
thanks for all the replies.,
for the avoidance of doubt i was diagnosed with type 2 last month.,
this followed an hba1c of over 100.,
i was put on metformin of 500 mg 3 times a day.,
starting at one tab a day and building up to 3 a day.,
"i don't feel bad, in fact i feel better than i have done for some time.",
i'm just curious about what happens if you go too low and what i should do to avoid that happening.,
i'm very pleased that my bg has come down to normal levels.,
my pre dinner reading this evening of 4.5 was followed by a reading 2 hours after dinner of 6.3.,
at the moment i am keeping my carb intake to less than 100 g. i'll keep a close eye on my levels and go to my doctor if it gets too low.,
george.,
i know someone with t1 low blood sugar who don't make insulin so they have to have insulin given to them to survive.what i don't understand is why do they usually lose about 15-20 years off their life span if they are getting their insulin and that's supposed to keep them alive...so why should life span be shorter?,
"hi, im a type 2 diabetic, ive been diagnosed for 16 months.",
"still juggling meds, although i think we have my sugar readings fairly stable now.",
"i often suffer from really cold, painful toes.",
my gp's comment...'its all part of the diabetes!',
not overly helpful :?,
......so does anyone else suffer from this and do you have any suggestions how to deal with it.,
"ha ha ha that cheered me up :lol: have had feet checked a couple of times in the last year, do try to keep them warm.",
sometimes they just ache (like now) even though they dont feel cold.,
"they can get quite painful, will mention it again at the surgery.",
thanks for your help.,
"thanks for all the advice, will book an appointment with the diabetic nurse and take it from there.",
going off to read up on low carb diets now,
"hi please could you advise me, my daughter was a type 1 diabetic ,i have been feeling a little unwell and used her blood machine over the last few days my first reading 2 hours after an evening meal was 9 ,i then did two fasting tests on two differant days first one was 6.9 and this morning was 7.0 during today i have done two further test at 2pm it was 4.6 and at 5pm its now 7.0 .i have a thirst mainly during the evening and bad headaches ,and tired please advise me am i worring over nothing or should i see my gp ?",
"i am 63 , thank you for any help ,sue dear ed, thanks for your reply i have just taken a test 2 hours after my evening meal and it reads 9.2 is that ok ?",
"thanks, sue.",
"dear denise,thank you for getting back i will book an appointment with my gp.",
"xx thanks smidge i will take note of what you said and make an appointment for next week if they can fit me in ,should i continue to take my blood tests untill then or should i just stop worrying ?",
sue.,

"when it's december, it's close to christmas, and it's been snowing outside all day ... is it okay for a diabetic to eat mince pies with impunity?",
i'm not a medical expert...,
but ... it seems reasonable to me that this should be allowed.,
"and after reading study after study, nobody has specifically advised against it.",
so that's the same as saying that it's fine.,
isn't it?,

is it possible it goes low?,

"since my sister in law did 2 fasting glucose meter readings for me, both a bit high,8.8mmol and the other a bit lower, i bought a meter to test my own.i have felt unwell for a long time, going from a highly energetic person to someone who feels like they are on their last legs!",
"i am 37 years old and have been a runner since i was 15, and still throw myself out of the door to run 2 -3 miles 5 nights a week.",
"since i have had my meter i have had readings from 3.3mmol to 13.8 mmol ( 1/2 and hour after eating) what has scared me to death is that at 3.8mmol and 3.3 mmol i felt so ill, shaking, shivering and out of it, it has happened while driving which is scary.i drank 2 mouthfuls of lucozade on the 3.3mmol and went to 7.8 in 15 minutes.also any reading under 4.5 leaves me feeling very shaky (although i believe this is a normal reading) when my blood sugar is high i feel fine.my moods are unbelievable, like a yo-yo, my daughter says i am bi-polar but i know i am not.also i have noticed, if i go running it will go up 5mmol or so, i though exercise should bring bg down.this is all so strange, but i do not want to go to the doctor, although my sugar can go low so quickly, i will be fine one minute, then bang!",
"i have read a lot about hypoglycemia, and the only difference i have is that mine also goes high.the lows are scary when you are driving with your 5 year old in the car.please help, i am so sick of feeling sick,thankyou, daisy3174 posts: 4 joined: october 4th, 2011, 11:18 am thankyou for your reply.i have not been to a doctor ( i hate going).i have only been testing on the advice of my sister in law ( who is type 1) because she had done a few tests for on her meter for me because of my symptoms and she said the results were not normal and to go to the doctor, but i bought my own meter instead.i have definately been having these ""hypo"" things for a while but just didnt know what they were until i had my meter to measure.i just always used to reach for something to eat as i was starving with these symptoms so it used to work, daisy thankyou anna, yes i really must go, i just hate making a fuss at the doctors, i always feel as if i am putting them out x thanks hobs, yes i agree, i have been taking a bottle of lucozade everywhere i go because, it happens so suddenly,i just wonder if a doctor will take me seriously though, although i have the evidence of my meter showing my low readings.i have read on some sites on the internet that 3.3 and 3.8 are normal readings.however i know it isnt for me, if it was i would not have these terrible symptoms.also i read that only a dabetic who is using insulin can get hypo,s, thanks daisy3174 x thanks for that, does anyone know, if hypoglycemia can cause these high sugar levels too, as well as the low ones?",
"thankyou fallenstar, that is extremely helpful, and makes a lot of sense and you have all encouraged me to make a doctors appointment which i shall do tomorrow, will follow up after my visit, thankyou all x thanks, i have read that hypoglycemia causes either a flat line curve with all low values or cause a spike then a quick drop.but i dont see values in hypoglycemics going as high as 12s and 13s.plus mine will always spike at 1/2 and hour, so i will have 6.0mmol, starting bg, then 1/2 hour after a meal, 12 - 13.8mmol, then 1 hour, 10mmol and usually 7-8 mmol at 2 hours, the big drop will come a few hours later.these values are not really diabetic range are they?",
"only the 1/2 hour reading, which they would not get on a gtt, as they measure at 1 hour and 2 hour intervals, thanks daisy ok thanks.am i right in saying that normal values for a gtt are these-: fasting - 5.5mmol - 7mmol 1 hour - less than 11.1mmol 2 hours - less than 7.7mmol hi,i decided to try and do my own home gtt, before i go to a doc to make sure i am not making a fuss about nothing.i took readings every half hour, to see if there was a pattern, i drank a 368ml (small bottle) of original lucozade and washed hand thouroughly in between.results were -: 9.05 - fasting - 6.5mmol 9.20 - 10.9mmol ( did this after 15 mins to see how quick it was getting into my system) 9.35 - 10.1mmol 10.05 - 8.7mmol 10.35 - 4.2mmol (felt v shaky at this point even though it is normal) 11.05 - 5.5mmol had 1/2 a can of lemonade as i was really thirsty) 11.35 - 9.3mmol 12.05 - 8.2mmol went running this evening and reading was 4.8mmol only to rise to 8.7mmol.i really dont want to go to docs if these are okay and you guys on here probably know more than a lot of doctors, thanks in advance for any info x",
hi i was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 4 years ago and was put on glucophage (metformin powder sachets) as i am unable to swallow tablets.,
they have ceased to be made now and i have been given 850mg tablets which say i should not crush.,
my chemist says i can but the instructions say not to.,
i have crushed some and they are very bitter and make me gag.my gp says it is too expensive to prescribe me it in liquid form.,
i have now stopped taking any and do not feel too good.,
any suggestions and are they safe to crush?,
catherinecherub said: the fact that they are slow release means that they work over a period of time so crushing them is not a good idea.,
"this article tells you, glucophage sr tablets are usually taken once or twice a day.",
these tablets should be swallowed whole with a drink either during or just after a meal.,
"they must not be broken, crushed or chewed.",
read more: http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/diabetes/medicines/glucophage.html#ixzz3ofhw74s3 have you tried having a drink of water through a straw at hand and use this to help them go down?,
click to expand...,
i got the mg wrong they are metformin 500mg tablets but do not say slow release on them.,
i had read that some are slow release and some immediate release.,
if mine are immediate i would assume i could crush but as i say the instructions inside state do not crush.,
i have a bit of a phobia of swallowing all tablets so a straw and drink would not help unfortunately.,
i have been a type 2 diabetic for several years now and is managed by medication.,
i watch what i eat and i rarely touch alchohol.,
i also suffer from fibromyalgia which makes exercise difficult but i still manage to take gentle exercise.,
i have been taking my blood sugar levels and today my reading has come back at 9.9.,
will the fact that i am sleeping quite poorly affect my sugar levels?,
what else can you suggest i can do to get this down before my next diabetic clinic as i do not want to go down the insulin route?,
"how was the post-op treatment you had in the hospital/community, what dressings were used, did you have npwt, or granulox, did you have a quick recovery with little or no hic-up's or did it turn into a long haul...",
"i've a story to tell, one that appears to be the same as many i have spoken with in my time in nhs care, but i'd like to hear from others first before relating mine, would that be acceptable?",
many thanks stu.,
"thanks for the replies, i'm busy typing up what's been happening, hopefully it might give people yet to have this come about, some insight as to how i've been treated and what they feel they would do if it happens to them.",
stu.,
"that's good you do, one thing i think was very helpful was going on the dafne course ( http://www.dafne.uk.com/ ) in 2013...",
"thanks for the replies, and no, it's not a good story, but i think it should be brought out to show how things have gone since it started in late december 2012.",
"i've had type 1 diabetes since i was 2, so that's coming up to 53 years now.",
"i had fright when my right foot went cold in the summer of 2003, which was quickly diagnosed as pad, and after scans was shown i had a severe narrowing in my femoral artery, with more problems in both anterior & posterior tibial arteries and the peroneal.",
"it also showed the arteries in the foot to be very restricted, in that it was like having a 3 core cable, turning into a single just below the ankle, ouch!",
"as a consequence i had an angioplasty on the femoral aertery which gave me a breathing space of another 5 years, before it had a major shut down in 2008, which after a discussion with my vascular consultant, we decided it best to go for a bypass with the ptfe one, as it would be less invasive and allowed me to get back to work quicker than if i had a blood vessel taken from the left leg, that sorted it and is still working fine & dandy to this day!",
"between these two events i saw the same consultant at least twice a year and then was changed to one yearly visit to check all was fine, i also had doppler checks at the diabetic clinic at my gp surgery.",
"all this was duly put down in my medical notes, for all to see.",
"and started looking after my feet a lot more than i had before any whoo, back to december 2012... one day, i noticed that the right fifth toe seemed drier underneath than normal and put some aqueous cream on it as i usually did each day after showering, and making a mental note to keep an eye on it.",
"after a couple of days i hadn't notice it getting any better and as i was going into the surgery to have a blood sample taken for the diabetic nurse in two weeks i thought i would ask the nurse there who was also going to take a doppler and check my feet, what it might be, that was the monday.",
"it turned out it was athletes foot, and she said to get a cream from the chemist, which i did that day and started to look more closely at it day by day, by the end of that week it looked exactly the same, flaky.",
"the second week, all seemed as before, flaky.",
"but on the wednesday night, i noticed there was a hair line crack in the skin, which looked a little red and decided to give the doctor a bell the next morning to see what i should do.",
got through at 8.30am and was told the doctor would ring me around 12.00 - he rang and i asked him if i should be on antibiotics as i was worried about it leading to problems if nothing more was done with the bad circulation in my leg and foot.,
"i was surprised by his answer, which basically was a lecture on why he wouldn't give me antibiotics for it could worsen things more than it would cure, he didn't need to see it as i was seeing the diabetic nurse the following monday and keep an eye on it over the weekend.",
"that was thursday... friday night i checked it again and the crack looked about the same, but there appeared to be a very slight darkening space about 2x3mm on the top of the toe, right side, low, which after a closer inspection and a rub with the towel, seemed to be nothing more than dye from the new socks i had been wearing that day... saturday, had to go to work again, came home and got ready to shower, that little dark area was now back again, but more pronounced and defined, like a black spot trying to form, ****, was not happy & decided to visit the local a&e next morning, opening at 11.00am, didn't sleep a wink!",
"sorry its so long, i'm a bit of a waffler when i write, will try to condense it... stu... ali h said: my dad currently has foot and leg issues, we have regular district nurse visits to dress them.",
"he has neuropathy and cannot feel any injuries, his legs are constantly leaking fluid now and range from bright red and infected to scabby and under control.",
"they put inadine dressings on, the orange coloured ones, along with various other bits and bobs.",
what has happened to you dare i ask?,
"click to expand... hi... you'll have to wait for what's happened to me, but i can relate to your fathers problems well.",
"inadine seems to be one of the nhs's cure all, i've had it many a time and it's something that made little difference to my problem, ever.",
"that's not saying it's not worth trying it, but there must be some dressing changes made after a certain time period, especially if there's no visible positive change to the condition.",
"in my time over the past 28 months there seems to be a marked reluctance of trying something else, at a cost to the patient's condition.",
ali.,
"yes, you are lucky to have both a gp and practice nurse's that know what their doing, i've had some that can't put a vac dressing on, without wrapping 300 foot of drape on your foot, trying to stop a air leak and still failing, or cleaning a diabetic chronic wound with tap water, and then saying that's what we always do... as a consequence i had an infection that put me back in hospital on a antibiotic drip for a week.",
my best wishes to your dad and your family.,
stu.,
hi ali.,
"funnily enough, it was staring her right in the face, i had my 5th right toe of the right foot removed on the 19th november 2014 and was having my dressing changed daily in the week at another surgery as i had to move from my home to my sisters as i wasn't allowed to drive and had to offload it as much as possible.",
"the weekends were covered at the local hospital by community district nurses, and this is where i found a vast disparity in experience and knowledge of community nurses, not good.",
"things like not having sterile scissors, or tweezers with them, and not being able to get them from the hospital.",
"on the occasion with the tap water, i brought all the dressings and an aerosol of saline solution put out for her to use, but because she didn't know how to alter the bed, while i was dealing with that i didn't notice where she got the water from to clean the wound.",
"i only found that out after she had finished dressing the wound and while she was clearing up, i noticed there were no empty plastic tubes that are used to contain the saline solution, so asked what she had used as she didn't use the aerosol one i brought.",
"she had used tap water, and didn't know the aerosol contained sterile saline, even though it was written all over it!",
"i also had a ribbon packing dressing that had to be changed every day, as the little toe had been taken off back to the metatarsal, it left a hole nearly 25mm deep, that usually took a length of 100mm ribbon to fill it, and left around 80mm to remove the next day.",
"on this occasion the nurse had washed the wound and then started to dry it, so i queried why she hadn't removed the ribbon, she said she had washed it all out, which patently she had not and i could still see it in there - she wouldn't have it and argued with me that it had all dissolved, in the end i relented as she said i was being aggressive, but then she started to try and pull it out, and then squeezed it, by then i had had enough and said to her to leave it alone and finish dressing it, i was amazed when she then opened the ribbon dressing and started to push it in on top of the old one!",
"i let her finish, thanked her and left, when i got back to my sisters, i sterilized a pair of stainless steel tweezers, removed the outer dressing, removed the ribbon she had packed over the old one, removed that as well, cleaned the wound, repacked it with the remaining part that was left and redressed my foot.",
"luckily the next day was monday, and could then have it done by the practice nurse at the surgery, who couldn't imagine how a supposedly proffessional nurse could make such a hashup of something that is basic ali... haven't been on metronizadole, but flucloxacillin and i are close friends!",
"i would have thought a drip would get to your dads infections quicker that oral antibiotics, but what do i know.",
"i tried to get the vascular team to use ""granulox"" but to no avail, basically was told that they don't change medication when it's having good effect and then said the nhs podiatrist that had been using this in trials was probably getting a back hander from the manufacturer to promote it.",
condescending consultant!!!,
"i actually contacted mike green and asked if there was any chance of him contacting my podiatrist and seeing if there was a way i could have a trial, he said he would welcome a call from my diabetic podiatrist and gave me his email - i passed it on to him, but never got any confirmation he actually spoke with him!",
"see here... https://woundcare-today.co.uk/support/uploads/1415203991case report document.pdf ali... you should ask about using a vac, either the kci activac unit which costs 140 for three days rental or the pico vac, that goes for 120 and works for 7 days.",

"the problem is instead of following through until closure, they stop using npwt after a week and because of the bad circulation the wound stalls under a carpet of slough that the two dressing above can't shift!",
your dad if he was allowed to use a vac would have to get the infection under control and then get them to debride the affected area's before using a vac.,
"your dad could go home with either models, but if there is a lot of exudation they would use the kci unit as it can collect the fluid in a canister, where the smith & nephew pico hold's any exudation in the dressing.",
"just google about the use of npwt and see the results, then ask your self why its not used more, especially in regard to diabetic ulcers, and then bloody push to get them to change what their using now as from what i've seen of all the people i've spoken to over the last 28 months of sitting in nhs waiting rooms they have little hope of healing their conditions and end up losing a limb...",
"hi all, i have always been using nph (humulin i) overnight and shots of regular humulin for each meal.",
"i recently broke my radius by falling downstairs in the middle of the night - my blood was a little low, so i have been off work which has given me time to look into things.",
"so, i am now for the first time ever in 31 years, questioning whether i should change my insulin.",
"my nph is unpredictable and i have never questioned that before, just accepted it.",
i think i would benefit from having a basal dose during the day as this mimics the way the body works naturally and i have been advised that tresiba is a new long lasting and dependable insulin.,
others it didn't work with have said that toujeo is very good.,
i experience the dawn phenomenon so i think having a daytime basal dose would help as currently i have to test multiple times and make changes around my workouts.,
has anyone tried these 2 insulins and can you share your experiences?,
i am seeing a diabetic nurse this evening.,
"many thanks, ali",
"morning everyone, i hope you are all well or doing ok?",
i am currently awaiting a freestyle libre system.,
"please can you advise, if you use this system how do you dispose of the :- the sensor insert the sensor i'm personally thinking the sensor will need to be disposed of into a sharp safe box?",
is there any official guidelines for for disposing of the insert?,
thanks in advance.,
"freestyle libre - disposal well i emailed the freestyle libre website the same question, so i will copy and paste there reply.",
for your information:- thank you for your e-mail.,
"this product should be disposed of in accordance with all applicable local regulations related to the disposal of electronic equipment, batteries, sharps, and materials potentially exposed to body fluids.",
the old batteries should be discarded in compliance with local government regulations.,
the libre sensors should be disposed in an eco friendly environment.,
"please visit your local pharmacy, and they will have a special bin for the disposal of medical equipment.",
"if you require any further assistance, please feel free to contact our dedicated customer careline team on 0500 467 466 * or again by email on adchelpuk@abbott.com .",
"customer care team abbott diabetes care uk hi admin, if this needs to be removed, feel free to remove it.",
thank you june_c said: i think there was a thread about this a while ago.,
i agreed to try and dismantle an old sensor applicator to see if there was anything 'dangerous' inside.,
"i couldn't get into it, hooligan that i was !!!!",
"when taking off the first expired sensor, i saw the small filament that had been residing in my arm.",
"it was very flimsy and quite 'bendy', so i decided it was extremely unlikely anyone would get stabbed by it and so i dispose of both sensors and applicators in the household rubbish.",
"used needles, of course should always go in a sharps bin.",
i think abbott are being ultra cautious and this is only my personal take on the situation.,
it's entirely up to you to decide what you want to do.,
"click to expand... hi june, thanks for your reply.",
i think your right about abbott.,
"that said, they have to be seen to be covering themselves and providing the correct guildlines.",
i am currently undecided about how i will dispose of it.,
i'm waiting for the system to arrive.,
the main descision i had already made was i would get a sharps bin for the sensors.,
made that descision on my gut instinct.,
i'm feeling pretty ott regarding the diabetes.,
"was newly diagnosed on the 11th march, type 2.",
"have been using a traditional blood glucose monitoring kit, and have bought a travel size sharp bin for the strips to be disposed of into.",
"doctor said no need to monitor but being as grandmother,mum and sister all have diabetes.",
i've felt i need to monitor.,
"i've been glad i have been as well, as levels are fluating currently.",

in my view there is nothing riskier then very common bathroom waste - by which i mean disposable razors or the like.,
"the sensor's filament appears to be a teflon coated nylon ""bristle"" if you stood on it, i can't think of anyone whose skin would be punctured - not even a child.",
obviously those are my personal views.,
click to expand...,
"morning, all views and opinions are welcome, being as i'm new to all things diabetes.",
maybe i'm just over reacting though.,
i plan on having the libre and a traditional blood glucose monitor for back up.,
the members of my family all just have the traditional kits.,
"nan is type 1, mum, sister and me are type 2.",
brunneria said: i drop the sensor back into its wee screw pot and bin it.,
"the 'needle' is very soft and bendy, and the screw pot is secure.",
always keep the sensor packaging until you have finished with the sensor.,
"that way you have all the paperwork, id code numbers etc.",
if you need to contact abbott about it - failing sensors get replaced free.,
click to expand...,
"thanks for your reply, i'm a newbie.",
so all hints and tips are greatly appreciated.,
for me it's very interesting reading each persons take on how they disposed of the kits.,
i think it will help me make an informed descision ready for when i get the kit.,
"june_c said: you definitely need a blood glucose monitor as well, otherwise you'll have no idea how good/bad the sensor is.",
"most of mine have been good, registering about 0.5mmol/l different to the bg reading.",
an odd one or two have given results showing i was either hypo or hyper when i wasn't !!,
"as @brunneria has said, keep all the packaging until the sensor has expired in case you have to send one back.",
click to expand...,
"does that tend to be the norm, anyone with a libre has a tradional bg monitor as well?",
up until now i never realised there was so much out there diabetes related.,
i guess thats because up untill now i've never needed to be aware.,
"just checked the libre page, got a tracking number now.",
"i'm so excited it's quite sad, in my personal opinion.",
"expected arrival date is the 29th march, hope it either comes before that date.",
"or early on that date, as i have plans.",
andbreathe said: i don't know of anyone who has no other method of tracking their bloods.,
"the libre reader has an inbuilt traditional meter, so you can test from the handset quite happily, although the strips aren't the cheapest on the market.",
"it does make sense to have some strips at least for the libre reader as sometimes the support analyst will ask for readings taken either on the libre or another abbott meter, if things appear to be going awry with the sensor.",
"if you are to be prescribed test strips by your gp (the libre isn't available on prescription at all at the moment), it could be useful to ask for strips that will work with your libre, although most t2s don't generally manage that bit!",
"are you intending full-time utilisation of the libre, or a burst to begin with then intermittent use?",
click to expand...,
"i intend to fully utilise the libre, as i like the freedom it gives you unlike the traditional kits.",
"once, i've got the kit i'm going to buy strips that go with the libre.",
"the tradition kit that i'm hoping to have hopefully will have less expensive strips, and ones that i could potentially get on prescription from my gp.",
"intend on buying everything to begin, for my own piece of mind.",
"to be honest, i thought i'd get the starter pack.",
try it for the month and go from there.,
"i'm probably getting ahead of myself a bit, at this point i really don't know if it will work for me or not.",
hence by having the traditional kit as well i'll be able to make an informed descision.,
"i love gadgets, that's what initially appealed.",
plus the amount of information it gives you.,
"normally, as a rule my life is extremely busy.",
"currently off work sick, so life is slower.",
i wonder if i'm just adding pressure to myself when there's no need.,
making big descision like this without the full bigger picture if you get my drift.,
"probably, part of my reaction to the diagnosis.",
thanks so much to everyone who has posted.,
all the information and advice has been really helpful.,
"i'll be glad now when i have the libre, and my traditional bg monitor.",
at least then i'll see what my levels are doing.,

"i am 19 and i have insulin resistance blood sugar 84, and i want to stay non diabetic as long as possible, i still have 20 kgs to lose and mi bmi is 29.",
my doctor gives me metformin to help me lose weight.,
"has anybody here had a very long term insulin resistance(or reversed it) and stayed fit, healthy, and with a good diet they stayed non diabetic?",
i really want any glimmer of hope that i wont be diabetic until my 55-60s.,
high fat diet is proved to increase insulin resistance in non diabetic people from what i know sally and james said: perhaps you could provide a reputable source for this information.,

i've been taking omeprazole for the past 5 years for stomach acid reflux issues and am concerned that the delay in digestion is causing my blood sugars to increase a few hours after eating and after my fast acting insulin has been most effective.,
has anyone else noticed this?,
the reason i ask is that i find my blood sugars quickly go down (sometimes to hypo) after food but then can start shooting up after about 33hrs.,
i don't remember having this issue when i was first diabetic 30 years ago but have noticed it in the last few years.,
if anyone else has had a similar experience then i'd love to know.,
obviously meant 3hrs!,
from what i understand proton pump inhibitors delay the effect if digestion?,
"if that is the case this would certainly help with type 2 diabetics as their bodies typically produce insulin , but at a reduced or less effective rate.",
"therefore slowing the digestion would support type 2 control as that sugar rush doesn't occur as quickly and is more evenly spread, as i am a type 1 diabetic im concerned i get the fast acting insulin hit but as my digestion is slowed then i don't get the sugar rush to match the insulin rush within the first hour or so after eating, i've moved my injection sights to completely virgin sites to eliminate those.",
is anyone aware of an medical studies on the zonked and their impact on type 1 diabetes or even the time delay in food absorption?,
hi... can anyone point me in the right direction to find a chart that shows the equivalent levels in mmols and mg please?,
thanks in advance.,
thanks very much!,
hi i am a type 1 diabetic with a cluster of verrucas on the bottom of my left foot.,
"my gp, community podiatrist, hospital nurse specialist and hospital podiatrist have all informed me that nothing can be done with them due to my diabetes.",
my gp has prescribed me salycic(?),
"acid in the past to apply to them, but it affected the skin around the verruca and didn't actually do anything to them.",
due to the acid affecting the healthy skin i stopped using it.,
the cluster seems to be growing and although they don't hurt im at my wits end with them!,
is there anything else i can do or try?!,
thanks!,
thanks to you both!!,
!,
the question i would like to ask is if there are more than 38000 members of this site why have less than 4000 of them signed the epetition http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/20537 so really there is just the eight of us listed at the bottom of the page.,
ok maybe there are more that will be on later but i think it's a bit misleading to claim 38000 when that number probably represents how many members there have ever been but most of whom do not participate.,
borofergie.,
i don't suppose we could entice you to vote could we?,
think of us who might have to pay 15 for 50 strips.,
"desidiabulum said: of course one way to get signatures on the e-petition up to 40,000 would be if every current signatory would persuade ten friends/family to sign it.",
worth a try?,
click to expand...,
it is worth a try.,
also i was looking up the terms and conditions regarding who could create or sign a petition and it said the following.,
"to create or sign an e-petition, you must be either: a british citizen a resident in the uk (you normally live in the uk) it doesn't say that you have to be both, just either one or the other.",
can oz claim to be british still?,
"borofergie said: you need also to remember that the popular media also paints t2 diabetics as ""fatties that did it to themselves"".",
"our cause is not always a popular one, even in the wider diabetic community, and we are often unfairly labelled as a drain on nhs resources.",
click to expand...,
there are many issues in your comments to which i don't have answers.,
i wonder why people would join a site like this and not vote for adequate treatment.,
mod edit (pneu): type i and type ii are both serious conditions to suggest that one community is more or less important.. or that one doesn't support the other (which on this forum we all support each other).. is not justified.,
i only asked a simple question but it is getting more complicated by the minute.,
"littlegreycat said: getting a bit bitter and twisted, are we squire?",
the epetition is voluntary and a matter of individual decision.,
pushing people and bad mouthing t1s isn't going to help.,
click to expand... not bitter and twisted at all.,
also not bad mouthing anyone since i didn't appreciate there was bad feeling until this thread.,
however i think i will take the answers i already have and skulk off into the background before the mods accuse me of inciting a riot.,

kathy jayney1966 said: i've been taking metformin for 7 years.,
"the first 2 years were hell with sickness, stomach disturbances and the runs.",
after that they changed it to the slow release version and i've been much better.,
started off ever so slow with the dose.,
"eventually asked to see a consultant who sorted me out in one month with other drugs and asked if i could manage to take even a half of a metformin tablet, it would help.",
did this and slowly upped it to 2 a day.,
now inject victoza but still managing to tolerate the met formin.,
try and keep going with it as it helps protects your heart and kidneys etc.,

"hello - this is the first time i have used this forum and i am not too sure of the insulin that my fiance uses but he injects morning (48mls) and evening (22mls) with a pen, i thinks it is novomix.",
my brother however injects before each meal and feels this way he has more control and isn't always having to eat to keep up with the insulin.,
my brother is quite slim and very strict with his diet but my fiance loves his food and whilst he wants and needs to loose weight he is not too good at sticking to a healthy diet - in my opinion he allows his bs to fall too low by not eating at regular intervalls and then wants chocolate/ice cream and all the things that put weight on.,
"because of this, would he be better on my brother's regime (is it novo rapid) - and in that case he would have to understand the carb content of everything he was eating to know how much to inject?",
thank you thank you for your reply nigel - i've only just seen it as i'm not used to using this site.,
i will take your advice but will my fiance have to really count and understand his carbs better to be able to go on the different regime?,
he's not too good at being strict with himself and i wonder if he wil just inject and eat what he feels like!!!,
he's a big kid!!,

"i've been storing both my novorapid & lantus solostar open injection pens in the coolest place i could find in my house (in a drawer in the kitchen, inside a tupperware box), i have been removing the needles straight away after use and putting the pen lids back on yet they are still getting air bubbles (the unused ones are stored in the fridge of course).",
is there something i'm doing wrong here or do i need a special cooler box due to the weather because i've read that once they have air bubbles inside the dose can be quite inaccurate?,
i was diagnosed with t2 about 6 months ago with an a1c test result of 7.1 blood pressure 148/80.,
threed months on and 3 stone lighter my a1c has dropped to 5.9 and blood pressure to 113/63.,
the dr has said i will be tested on a yearly basis.,

doespecially this sound correct or should i buy a blood sugar meter,
"hello my name is peter i am a diabetic type1 and have been since i was 11 i'm 25 now and just wondered if there was any other diabetics that are happy to have diabetes as i am i actually like the routeine i like the free medical card i like the free nutritionist i like that i can manipulate insulin and use it to my advantage i like explaining to people that i have diabetes and how it all works i used it as a chat up line on many occasions and it gets a rely good conversation going i like how it makes you disciplined and keeps you head i focus with reality i also enjoyed it during party years whenever i felt sick or bad but as long as my sugars are right i'm ok just like in the gym if i feel low in energy ill test my sugar but if its not my sugar and its just me feeling tired then i know it's ok to push even harder its like a little man saying well your ok here man but stop arsing about and get back into it just wondering if anybody else was happy with diabetes because diabetics give diabetes such a hard time sometimes if you want to live strong and healthy you must except you diabetes and be friend him , i prob sound like a nut case to some people here but sure how and ever :-d re: is there anybody out there that is happy to have diabete hay ya sarah 69 why can't u eat chocolate you must b type 2then yeah ?",

"is it with every test, daily or longer?",
"hi all, first post on here and i'd really appreciate your advice.",
i work in day services foe adults with learning difficulties.,
a man that i work with and have done so for 4 years has wildly fluctuating blood sugar levels.,
he is tested at home at 8.00 am and averages 20.0 and comes into service by 10.00 am.,
we are able to test him and again his levels vary greatly from 4.0 to 15.0 at this time.,
he is tested throughout the day (at lunchtime and 2 hours after lunch) and there is no pattern.,
"for example, a few days ago, at lunchtime his reading was 13.4, then when tested after lunch (of pie and potatoes), his levels dropped to 4.5.",
"he used to see his diabetic clinic regularly but doesn't seem to go any more but when i used to take him, his hba1c readings were considered ok (at 8) even though to me, his blood sugar levels are all over the place.",
he has even been known to be 19.0 at 9.00 am then found collapsed with readings of 1.1 two hours later.,
"when admitted to hospital after this, he was discharged a few hours later without, in my eyes, proper investigation.",
i thought it would have been an ideal time to complete a baseline check.,
"please could i be given some advice to pass back to the team and care manager, as i feel that this young man will suffer serious health consequences at a later date if he is not regulated and looked after proprley soon.",
thank you in advance and i really hope your greater knowledge will help me help this individual.,
thanks for your reply.,
insulin is administered by the family at 8.00 am and again at 4.00 pm.,
"if levels drop below a certain level, dextrose x 3 is given, conversely if levels increase over a certain level, we were told to exercise and give water.",
i completely agree in terms of the concern about the long term effect that this current situation gives.,
"would you recommend recording the blood sugar levels over a period of time, say a month, then visit the diabetic clinic to pass the information on.",
i have done this before but to no effect.,
"why are blood sugar levels so erratic, in terms of increasing one day after food intake yet dropping alarmingly the next after food?",
i'm really confused and frustrated by the lack of obvious pattern.,
"hello everyone, what kind of basal/bolus ratios do you have and how do they work for you?",
"i'm on an insulin pump and i started a low carb diet a few years ago because i was struggling with binge eating disorders and high carb foods seemed to trigger it, and it really improved things for me.",
"i had no more mood swings, stopped binge eating, felt generally healthier and my blood sugars stabilised significantly.",
"but when i saw my consultant, he said that my basal/bolus ratio was ""wrong"" (it was around 65% basal, 35% bolus) and told me to up my bolus ratio, and drop my basal rate (despite the fact that my control had improved).",
"as a result i started having hypos after meals, and then rebounding highs, and with the ups and downs in my blood glucose the mood swings came back and i started binge eating again.",
"anyway fast forward a few years of bad control (and having to come off the pump due to infections) and i've started on the pump again 3 weeks ago, my binge eating worse than ever so somehow found the willpower to give up sugary or high carb food again a few days ago.",
"since then my basal/bolus ratio has settled around the 65% basal 35% bolus mark again and i know my dsn is going to tell me to sort that out next time (because last time i saw her she'd commented that it was perfect at 50%:50%), but i just don't understand what the problem is if it means my blood sugars are more stable?",
i tried to tell my consultant the first time that i wasn't eating many carbs and surely to have a 50:50 ration i'd have to start eating more but he still wanted me to change it.,
anybody else on a low carb diet have any idea what their ratio is?,
"thanks, sarah i find it interesting that the doctors seem to think a 50:50 ratio is the best because surely when we all have different lifestyles with different levels of activity, different amounts of food we eat, different metabolisms and different insulin sensitivities etc, i would've thought a basal/bolus ratio couldn't possibly be a textbook number?",
"anyway, no shame to be had in repeating the dafne course, some people understand exactly what to do but still can't get it right (like myself), but did they give you the book with all of the information in it?",
i'm guessing it didn't help you anyway so have you tried reading the diabetes.co.uk advice?,
"http://www.diabetes.co.uk/insulin/adjusting-insulin-doses.html x thanks for all of your responses, i'm glad to see i'm not the only one on more basal than bolus!",
i believe it's quite common to be the other way around (and apparently the doctors don't mind that as much which again i don't understand!),
but hadn't managed to find people with similar ratios to me.,
"it's also good to know i'm not crazy for questioning what the doctors want me to do, i'm beginning to think i need to have more faith in my own judgement!",
"i feel so much better on the low carb diet and if they do tell me to change the ratios again next time i'm in i'm definitely going to challenge them on it because as i think i said earlier, my control is so much more stable and my average blood glucose is the best it's ever been, so i have clear evidence that 65%:35% is working for me now, and i have a 14 year history of the 50%:50% ratio fuelling my binge eating habits, depression and consequential hba1cs of over 14%.",
and if they disagree with me this time i'm just going to have to stand my ground!,
"lizdeluz said: thank you, lilyfleur, i was given lots of hand-outs and a 'diabetes type 1 workbook'.",
"i've kept all these in a file, but they don't tell me enough.",
"there is nothing about calculating basal, though there are exercises in calculating bolus requirements.",
nothing about bolus/basal ratio.,
"from what you say, it sounds as though the book didn't exist when i did the course(s!)",
"- which, admittedly, was in 2005, and i think dafne had only just started, and was called dafydd where i live!",
(dose adjustment for your daily diet) thank you very much for the link - i will get studying and try to better understand where i'm at.,
what you said about a textbook ratio seems to make sense to me.,
"all those variables - diet, metabolism, exercise - must make it very difficult for doctors to arrive at dosing decisions, especially if the patient (me, for example!)",
hasn't kept adequate records.,
click to expand... oh and re: lizdeluz....,
"yes i think it is possible the workbook is a more recent thing, although having had a flick through last night it was more useful for mdis than basal/bolus but i'll have to get back to you on this because i'm currently low so can't concentrate well enough to understand even what my point is let alone anything else haha, i'll come back to this when my treatment kicks in!",
i continue to look for ways to improve my diet whilst maintaining enjoyment of food.,
one area we hear a lot about is reducing salt intake.,
"as i make most of my food from scratch with limited prepackaged foods, i have been considering replacing my salt with low sodium alternatives such as low salt and so low.",
my understanding is that these products replace some of the sodium chloride with potassium chloride.,
this is not recommended for people on some heart and respiratory drugs.,
i also notice the packets say they are not recommended if you have diabetes but cannot find any reason for this.,
is this laziness from the manufacturers assuming if you have diabetes you are more likely to have heart problems so more likely to be on the drugs which do not work well with potassium?,
or is there a sinister reaction between potassium chloride and analogue insulin or metformin or ...?,
does anyone know?,
"in the meantime, i am cutting back on the amount of normal salt i have in my food: i do not add it to boiled/steamed vegetables and half the amount when i bake bread.",
"hi folks, this may seem an odd question, but here goes anyway.",
do people with diabetes experience an altered sense of smell?,
i'm finding that the scent of my usual laundry liquid & fabric softener is unpleasant & makes me feel nauseous.,
i can't tolerate my favourite fragrances anymore either.,
"i've noticed many aromas, that never used to bother me, now make me cringe.",
my sense of taste has changed too.,
all very weird.,
"i haven't got a throat, sinus or respiratory infection/problem, so i'm wondering if my ""symptoms"" are related to my diabetes.",
can anyone offer their experience or advice please?,
ali.,
"x hi @maria111979 , @daibell , @noblehead , thanks for taking the time to reply to my post.",
"yes, i am taking metformin, but haven't experienced a metallic taste.",
perhaps my altered sense of smell isn't related to my diabetes after all.,
it's puzzling!,
guess i'll just have to put up with it.,
best wishes.,

i will be finally repatriatng to uk next month from thailand and would like to know the legal position for diabetic drivers regarding what the police view as too low or too high blood sugar levels if stopped by the police or in an accident?,
i believe they view a hypo under 5 as too low and could prosecute you.,
is this the lowest level?,
"and if a hyper was felt, what is too high for them?",
"i know one has to check before driving and then every 2 hours or so, despite doctors now being reluctant to prescribe too mant test sticks.",
"incidentally, i can buy test sticks and insulin over the counter here in thailand at many chemists without prescription.",
await your responses with thanks.,
"regards, john arran.",
has anyone else had a sensor come away about 1 week into using it.,
i used freestyle libre last year for some running events and it never fell off - in fact i had to try and rench it off.,
i have started events again but the last few sensors i have purchased haven't lasted more than a week!,
now that works out about 50 quid a week!,
they don't stick on as well.,
i will be complaining but i won't have any hope of getting a sensor for about a month from abott.,
am i being a grump or does anyone else feel abbott has them over a barrel because what other option do you have but to pay for a sensor and now wait for the product as well!,
thank you for your help everyone.,
i will ask at a pharmacy.,
i'm not asking for the libre on prescription -which may sound crazy i know but it doesn't suit me for my everyday needs and i do not want to go down the road of it replacing test strips.,
last year abbot were really happy to help as they needed my cash.,
"now they have a golden ticket with the nhs they sent a pretty snotty email reply when i asked (politely) about estimated delivery - quoting i ""knew the situation when i purchased the product"".",
i know how much of an advantage the sensor is but personally i don't think abbots product is actually that good - i use it for longer runs when i can because there isn't anything else (unless there is any other sensors on the market?,
??).,
sorry to sound so cynical so early on a bank holiday monday i will google this - sounds interesting thanks therower said: @bon83 .,
definitely research dexcom.,
running costs are slightly higher but information and quality are probably far superior.,
the modification that scott can advise on is also a much better option and source of information.,

some good advice here!,
i do feel i am being a little defeatist with the libre - it has helped me an was useful (once i learned more about how it works).,
there are things about it i don't like.,
.,
but that's a personal thing.,
i find the arrows and messages annoying sometimes.,
however i just really lost my temper with it when it came off - really easily this time.,
it frustrates me that abbott may replace this one but i will have to wait ages.,
i paid a lot of money for it - if it was a kettle or toaster from a shop i would be in there and getting another right away!,

"hello, is anyone using their toes for blood sugar checking?",
how accurate is it?,
how about a diabetic infant?,
should parents use their child's fingers all the time?,
thank you @indy51 phoenix said: there are lot's of 'leaflets'on the net from reputable sources that suggest using toes for infants and toddlers is fine and normal practice https://www.childrensmn.org/manuals/pfs/homecare/018321.pdf the great ormond street guidelines for professionals also includes using toes as well as fingers for children over a year ; but warns to avoid thumb and forefinger .,
(because needed for fine dexterity) http://www.gosh.nhs.uk/health-professionals/clinical-guidelines/blood-glucose-monitoring most say not to test toes in adults.,
i'm sure that's for the reason indy suggests but it could also be because the level might not be the same in the fingers and toes .,
i don't know whether that;s true but certainly in adults alternate site testing produces results with a time lag ie the level in an arm or a calf is twenty to thirty minutes behind that of the finger tip.,
that's ok for normal testing but not good in the case of fast falling glucose.,

i have lost almost 1.5 stone since i found out.,
i am currently taking 2 metformin a day (also 2.5 ramipril and 40 statin) but my goal is to come off the medication and control my bloods via diet alone.,
i'm currently following the gi way of eating.,

i complained about the heat to my boss who said that there is no law in the uk regarding maximum working temperatures.,

i'd appreciate any info on above.,
thanks greg.,
the circulatory system is affected by diabetes type 2 and described as causing 'poor venous return' but most of all with the term neuropathy.,
because i suffer from congestive heart failure and kidney disease - it is sometimes difficult to know what illness is responsible for what ailment.,
"some while ago on this forum i saw mention of pain in fingers, hands, wrists and forearms and the term neuropathy (i think) was used in this respect.",
"if only i had known that, in a very few months, i would be at the mercy of this condition which is affecting my life more than i could have imagined.",
it started with cramping of the hands caused when holding the handlebars of my motorcycle for too long or too tightly.,
i would have to get off and walk around swinging my arms to improve the circulation and i would be ok after that - or so i thought.,
second symptom manifested itself when holding a book or android for too long again resulting all fingers clasping together as one.,
"got used to dealing with that but then realised that i was dropping objects from my hands - not heavy such as a kettle, etc., but insignificant items - just paper on occasions - my hands were not using the autonomic system anymore.",
no - not a brain problem but the best way i can describe this.,
but all of this has quickly progressed to sharp and sometimes very severe pain some two or three inches above the wrists and now in the centre of the forearms.,
these symptoms appear to have become permanent.,
my greatest sadness is that is has stopped my proficiency with the piano which i so much enjoyed.,
"i would very much like to hear from members who can identify with these symptoms but, more importantly, what remedial treatment do they receive, if any, and how successful it has been.",
i am deeply indebted to the following members:- @ debzz carpal tunnel syndrome - recommends keeping hands warm @ greybags trapped nerve (?),
in elbow @ ninab73 finger triggering @ alaskaron neuropathy taking gabapentin & celecoxib @ bluetit1802 neuropathy treated successfully with alpha lipoic acid tablets from nature's best @ jennib pains in her hands and dropping things - relieved by using leather gloves and keeping hands warm there is more than enough to keep in mind if my condition worsens.,
"in two cases - keeping hands warm is a new idea i think, and may help many others trying this.",
the trapped nerve seems to be a candidate for a 100% cure.,
"now, how funny, i also suffered for a year or so with finger triggering which disappeared without me noticing - i had completely forgotten i had had it hahaha.",
i do not want to have to use alaskaron's tablets because i rattle enough already and there is bound to be a contra-indication but nevertheless more arrows in my quill if i become totally disabled by neuropathy.,
the suggestion i like the best though (because i may be able to afford them) is bluetit1802's very helpful suggestions to try alpha lipoic acid tablets from nature's best.,
part and parcel of the whole ailments described in this thread - are nocturnal leg cramps - i have virtually conquered this debilitating condition without quinine and would be happy to help by pm any member who cannot find the copious entries from me on the subject - i can promise to alleviate their pain.,
sorry to be late with my response but not too well in the stifling heat of bali at the moment - thank you all.,

over past few years i've had 3 steroid in injections in different fingers to treat triggering.,
all were successful in stopping the triggering.,
for last 6 months or so both middle fingers on each hand have been progressively more contracted.,
my hands are in constant pain right up each middle finger and on my palm at the base of middle fingers.,
"in the morning the pain isn't too bad and my fingers, whilst never straight anymore, are not too contracted.",
however as day goes on both pain and contracting get worse.,
i'm on naproxen for this and am waiting for an appointment at the pain clinic to come through.,
"have been to occupational therapy who've given me pressure gloves and therapeutic putty, this does help but very fleetingly, sometimes when i take gloves off the pain is worse, but they definitely help when driving.",
"i don't like the idea of staying on naproxen forever, which is basically what they're saying i may need.",
"they kill my stomach, so i also have to take lansoprazol.",

after checking the review of said meter ( http://www.diabetes.co.uk/blood-glucose ... meter.html ) i became very worried to read some of the comments posted now bottom line i have only recently been changed to the lantus insulin & am having some issues getting my blood lvls correct so for the moment it's a challenging time for me.,
the last thing i need right now is a inferior blood meter to test my blood :twisted: do i have any say is this matter?,
is there anything i can do so i can continue to use my old blood meter ?,
"the other strange thing is from this link below, i was looking for staffordshire nhs guidelines & found this :- http://www.stokeccg.nhs.uk/news/diabete ... trent-758/ right at the bottom of the page it states the meter that has been picked is the wavesense jazz ????",
"many thanks to anybody taking the time to reply...... :thumbup: @ mo1905 i glad that your happy with the meter, but some of those comments posted on the review are v v concerning.",
"btw, obviously times have changed but i thought type1 diabetics couldn't drive lorries ??",
@ mr happy i agree with your point but it looks like different nhs authorities are using different blood meters ?,
@hobs could i pls ask which nhs authority you come under ?,
thank you all for your replies :thumbup: thanks hanadr i will google it :thumbup: i was thinking of giving my gp i letter saying what you stated as a last resort.,
"last year i spent xmas in hospital with ketonitis, i'd picked up a bug & in the end couldn't hold any food down, which in turn meant my blood lvls went haywire when i got out i was ok for month but then suffered from extreme hypos in the night, rolling on the floor with slurred speech & unable to move properly :crazy: :crazy: :crazy: the worst thing was i wasn't getting any signs that a hypo was on it's way, no double vision or pins n needles in my head for example.",
since then i've been on lantus n have had no hypos but my blood has been (at times) 1.8 - 2.8 n still no hypo signs.,
so the last thing i need right now is using a blood meter that may well be inferior to my present one.,
"@ mo1905 so times have indeed changed :shock: good for you, hope the reading stay good & you keep that job !!!",
anybody now if type1's are still banned from driving trains or flying planes ??,
@mo1905 well that was the whole idea of this thread.,
"in a ideal world i can hopefully run both meters for a while n see how much difference there is, of course there maybe none.",
"i'm not the greatest fan of my practice, as normal most (but not) of the reception staff think they are way way more important than they are.",
i rarely get to see a doctor set in the practice it's normally a locum and i always get the impression i'm a number not a name.,
"saying that the nurse who helps me with my condition is excellent 8) if i do test both meters for a time and there is a big difference, but they still won't help me then things will change a bit :twisted: i went to school with a guy who writes with the local paper, & they are having a couple of ""drop-in"" sessions to show people how to use the new machine.",
maybe i will give anybody going to the sessions a copy of my findings :wink: hopefully none of that will be necessary :thumbup: apples-mum said: @ henry-sugar my daughters dsn told her she can now fly a commercial plane but still not join the raf.,
don't know about trains tho'!,
"click to expand... thxs for the answer, that trucker question had just got me thinking is all... :crazy: hope it all works out well for your daughter 8) well i picked up the new meter today!!!!",
i will run them together for a couple of weeks n see what's what :wink: i will post my results here on the off chance somebody is interested 8) as stated above i have ran both meters side by side for a while.,
the glucorx is a brick of a size meter and on many occasions i had to re-test because the strip wasn't able to calculate from the blood sample.,
"results were fairly equal, apart from one occasion.",
my blood had tested high about 15.0 so i thought why on earth is that ?,
"so i re-tested from the same prick point, next reading?",
17.4 :shock: so i did it again 20.3 :shock: :shock: :shock: why on earth that was i have no idea since then my dn has started me carb counting & i'm using the accu-chek aviva expert which quite simple is brilliant 8),
my diabetic nurse has just put me on 100mg sitagliptin daily.,
my nurse is only in surgery 1 day per week and what was not made clear was whether the siitagliptin should be taken in addition to the 320mg of gliclizide & 3g of metformin i already take each day.,
does antone have any ideas?,
chris re: sitagliptin & glicazide thanks for the quick replies fellow diabetics.,
my average bs are 12 and i also need help to control my appetite & must lose weight.,
apparently sitagliptin fits the bill.,
"cheers, chris",
"hey, i'm new here - well not really, i've been browsing for months but never registered.",
"a little bit about me; i'm 25, female and 13.5 stones.",
(might be relevant).,
"i was diagnosed last january'ish as a type 2 diabetic - i was experiencing severe abdominal pain and the doc thought i had gall stones, however they couldn't find any and the pain went away.",
"during these investigations they noticed my blood sugar was 10 mmol, and so sent me for a ogtt test and it came back on the line at 11.1 mmol, suggesting a diagnosis of diabetes.",
i was sent home as a diet and exercise only diabetic.,
"the next day i bought myself a blood glucose monitor, and adopted a healthy diet, lowered the amount of carbs and sugar i ate, joined a gym and felt awesome.",
my readings were all in the 4 mmol - 5.6 mmol.,
i thought they made a mistake and my ogtt result of 11.1 mmol was on an off day.,
anyway i continued to spend a lot of money on test strips and test 5 or 6 times a day.,
i felt in control and comfortable with this.,
"now... on diagnosis i became a bit fed up and down in the dumps, didn't tell anyone and became very anxious of any medical appointments.",
"everyday i was receiving mail in the post from the hospital, opticians and doctors surgery, one day i got so angry and wrote a letter opting out of these medical appointments for a year.",
after all i was in control.,
i've lost 6.5 stones in 5 months (on a sensible diet and gym) and i felt amazing.,
however i noticed that my blood sugars were going up.,
"i got concerned when my very normal results were beginning to hit 6.5 mmol, then 7 mmol, followed by 8 mmol.",
then 10 mmol and suddenly hitting 14 mmol and today i have had readings in the 17 and 18 mmol's.,
"all these readings taken on waking, before meals and after.",
these readings are an average for that particular day or week.,
my blood sugars have gone up over a matter of say a month or 2.,
i have began to feel weak on many days and lazy.,
my diet has not changed and my exercise has not altered.,
"at first i put it down to maybe coming down with something, but i didn't.",
"today i took a urine test after reading some information on the internet, and my ketostix is showing a dark purple, which i guess means i have ketones in my urine.",
"i thought if i stuck to my excercise and diet, and lost the weight i've managed to lose, i would have improved a little, but instead i feel like i've taken a nose dive.",
i have an appointment with my doctor tomorrow.,
"i'm becoming a bit anxious now so was hoping maybe someone here may have an idea to what is happening with me, or if it has happened to anyone else here and what their doctor did.",
many thanks for reading.,
"i missed out in my post that when i started seeing these numbers rise, i had just come out of an overnight stay in hospital for a small head injury.",
whilst i was in hospital i had severe upper abdominal pain again and low blood pressure and sickness whilst i was experiencing the pain.,
"they didn't look into it, just sent me home in the morning with a head injury leaflet.",
it's been since then that the blood sugars numbers have been 8 mmol + .,
that was about a month ago.,
"my friend pointed out that perhaps it was pancreaitis, and at that point i had no idea the pancreas had anything to do with blood sugars hehe.",
but reading about this lada has made me think that maybe the two are associated.,
"if i had pancreaitis and my pancreas just.. died... and as a result i'm seeing these high numbers now, would i still be a type 2, or a type 1?",
"this is all so confusing - yet when i was diagnosed, i thought i had it in the bag!",
"thanks for the quick responses, it has been frustrating snodger and i remember how worried i was when it first hit 6 mmol, if only i knew back then... insulin is what i've been concerned about, but if it allows me to get myself under control again, it's worth it - however i work with a type 1 diabetic and have seen first hand what happens with too much insulin.",
"thanks for the link catherine, i've had a read, didn't even know there was such thing as lada.",
"it does fit with me i think, will have to see what the doctor thinks.",
"though i have zero hope in doctors, at least the ones i've had in the past.",
"hi ambrennan, they only gave me a oral glucose tollerance test and another random finger prick and then told me i had type 2 - i was overweight.",
"i tested again 10 mins ago and my glucose was 28 mmol, for dinner 3 hoursish ago i had a boiled egg, 2 strips of bacon and 2 low carb sausages.",
tested my urine again and the stick is still very purpleish.,
"feel pretty dreadful now though, the only way to describe it is as if i move my head left and it takes 4 seconds for my eyes to catch up.",
"am i right by thinking if i do have type 1 however, my blood sugar will not drop from 28 mmol now, but will rise?",
this is awful..,
"if i still have ketones in urine when i go to the docs in the morning, will he admit me to hospital?",
":s thought i'd let you know what happened at the docs, he didn't appear concerned to my relief, but also to my annoyance - i was hoping we could hurry things up and sort things out quickly and before my holiday, however it looks like i'll be feeling rubbish on my holiday too as i haven't even been able to book the blood tests for 2 weeks.",
he sent me home prescribing me 1x 500g tablet metformin tablet twice a day.,
"i have a question about this, i know i'm to take it as i'm eating or just after, but like tonight i'm feeling a bit ill and not hungry so don't want to have to force myself to eat something, do i have to eat to take it?",
can i have it on an empty stomach?,
"i don't know how long it takes to kick in but i had a readings of 22 mmol, 3.5 hours after eating a ham and cheese salad for lunch, plus taking my first metformin tablet.",
"anyway the doc is sending me for these tests, i don't really know what they are for, but can anyone tell me if they will be able to tell if i'm producing insulin at all, or if indeed i am lada?",
they are: full blood count - fbc urea and electrolytes blood glucose result serum lipids haemoglobin a1c level serum amylase (pancreatic) urine sample for organism also managed to win a 'fight' for him to prescribe me some avivo test strips - he said he will try and 'ween' me off those.,
i want to feel in control.,
he eventually prescribed me 50x avivo strips which i was happy about as i had used my last strip this morning and fed up of spending so much damn money on them things.,
thanks for all the advice.,
i'm being sent to a consultant and having more tests but ended up in the hospital today and being re-diagnosed as type 1.,
"had my first lantus insulin shot today, isn't painful at all, but no sign still of my blood sugar dropped i know she said it was slow acting insuling or somthing, but i had it at about 3:45pm and at 21:30 i was at 21.9 mmol after a small cup of lowish carb soup - i can't stomach anything atm, feel extremely sick and very tired.",
"going back on friday to see the nurse and she said if i still have this ammount of ketones, she will have to admit me into hospital she made me a bit uncomfortable and said she could smell ketones on me :s used way to much perfume on my exit from her office.",
feeling blah.,
thanks for all your info smidge.,
and everyone else too.,
"went bck to see the nurse tody, she is keeping me on 10 units of lantus and has started me on 4 units of humalog before meals.",
"started this this morning, it hasnt touch my sugar levels :s ?",
i gues 4 units is far too low?,
i was kind of hoping she would admit me so they can sort it out as i feel so poorly still and still have ketons.,
it is the most deep purple it can go.,
she said the humalog will hopefully get rid of the ketones.,
"i have to ring in on monday if i still have ketones she said, but my next apointment with her is middle next week.",
why isnt any insulin making my sugar levels drop??,
"what if for some unknown reason i dont react to insulin... gee ive been feeling unwell but pretty positive all week, but im beginingto lose my rag.",
"smidge she didnt tell me to count any carbs, should i be?",
"she just said take 4. thank you oh and just to add, i had my highest reading ever today after taking my humalog, 2 hours after a half a tin of mushroom shoup and a handful of blueberries, or are they blackberries... my bs was 26.4.. after taking my bs 2 hours after that again it was at 17mmol hi snodger, i have been told about hypos yes, if it goes below 4mmol then i need so much lucozade or something sweet, i have it written down.",
"snodger, i have been wondering, when and if i ever manage to get my levels down to normal, i will start feeling normal again?",
or is this the general type 1 feeling?,
"i dont think i feel like i should change my lantus, id be panicing all evening .",
"also, is it my imagination, but i have been having my lantus at 4pm only for the last 2 or 3 days when i started it, but at about 3:45 i get bad pain in my tummy, but as soon as i shoot the lantus, the quite severe pain disapears... maybe my body is expecting it already at 4pm ... or maybe im just going a bit crazy hehe i woke up this morning, and planned to up my lantus like was mentioned, but when i took my blood sugar, it was 14.4 - so much lower than the past 2 days.",
"i was so happy to see a lower number (still not low enough, but much better).",
"but so now i'm wondering, if i'm taking the same amount of insulin, and one day i wake up with like 18 mmol, the next 17, and the next 14 for example - if i changed my lantus - what if i hypo - why would i be high teens one day on lantus, and lower teens few days later... same food during day, (however i did add humalog yesterday - but thats only short acting so wouldnt effect my fasting blood sugar, right?)",
will be interesting to see what my blood sugar is in a while 2 hours after breakfast - suspect i'll be disapointed.,
still have ketones.,
going to ask about carb counting on wednesday.,
hi phoenix.,
thanks for your information.,
joining this forum has been a god send!,
i been feeling better today .,
"lower numbers, not low enough but going the right way.",
i don't think i am on too much insulin at the moment am i?,
10 units of lanuts a day and 4 units of humalog at meal times three times a day.,
"i know everyone is different, but that seems low to me .",
not a happy bunny :evil: after quite a good blood sugar day (for me) yesterday.,
i've woken up back in the 19.8 mmol.,
"evening, as a type 2 diabetic who smokes, i have been working hard to not only control sugars but also cut down/out smoking.",
recently i have been having some good success by using an electronic cigarette.,
"the manufacture suggests all flavours ranging from traditional tobacco (not real but simulated) through to cinammon, mint and cherry flavours are basically all the same constituent ingredients (but taste different).",
here is a list of the ingredients of the 'vape' as they call it:- - 1.6% is nicotine - 0.9% is lactic acid - 91.2% is medial/food grade propylene glycol - 4.5% is food alcohol - 1.8 % food perfume i assume the food perfume add the cinammon or mint or cherry or tobacco flavour?,
; not sure.,
i am hoping that the above isnt going to up my sugar levels when inhaled as a vapour.,
is there any advice.,
the suggestion of cinammon and or cherry would be nice (rather than the basic tobacco flavour they do) but i really dont know if theres a downside for a diabetic.,
has anyone researched electronic cigarettes and diabetes?.,
would love to keep of the smelly weeds and of course hopefully the electronic cigarettes over time.,
thoughts?,
hello everyone just a quick question.,

can diabetes make your hair fall out?,
for the past few weeks my hair has been falling out in handfuls whenever i wash or brush my hair.,
i have to pull my hair out of my brush everyday.,
i've got thick hair but can feel its starting to thin out in places.,
"i was diagnosed t2 back in june and am on 4 x 500mg metformin a day, low carbing and the weight is steadily falling off.",
"this is starting to get me down now, especially as i haven't felt this well in a long time, so any advice would be appreciated.",
sent from the diabetes forum app many thanks for all your help.,
i do have an underactive thyroid and have been on medication for the past 4 years for it and haven't had any significant hair loss in that time.,
i definately will be making a drs appointment as i can now see a definate bald patch on the crown of my head and it doesn't help it's red from getting sunburnt when i was on holiday last week and still sore.,
"thanks again for your replies sent from the diabetes forum app i've got a drs appt tomorrow so fingers crossed x sent from the diabetes forum app gymqueen well done on all your weight loss, that is fantastic.",
"i also have a lot of weight to lose but as i'm disabled with mobility and balance problems i find any exercise hard to do, so mainly stick to using my pedal exercise.",
the weight (as well as hair!),
is coming off so i must be doing something right!,

anonymous question submitted: i have been reading through your website and others regarding the reversing type 2 diabetes.,
i understand a 700 calorie diet can achieve the reversing of the disease.,
i am not over weight (10st 11lb and 5ft 11in tall).,
what advice could you give me regarding this diet i have read.,
"to submit a question, please go to http://www.diabetes.co.uk/ask-an-anonymous-question.html",
i've begged and begged for help for the past 2 years of being diagnosed.,
"and in those 2 years, my diabetes is way out of my control, i don't inject, i don't test, my teeth have all gone and i have to get all my teeth extracted at the age of 21 and have to get dentures, i shouldn't have to get dentures at my age.",
"i asked countless times in person and by email for some help with testing and injecting, i'm scared of needles (ironic, huh?)",
"i don't like the pain it causes me (also tattooed and pierced, still ironic).",
i feel i've been let down multiple times by my diabetes team.,
"they were suppose to get me 2-3 monthly appointments again to help me, haven't heard anything.",
not since 16th august.,
has anyone else had problems?,
"i feel this is becoming personal now, as i see so many other diabetics in the clinic getting help, looking healthy.",
i sometimes end up crying when i leave the clinic as i feel they don't like me because i'm not a good diabetic!,
"ok so i'm off to the indian this weekend for a regular curry with mates, however this will be my first visit since starting the low carb diet.",
"normally a visit to the curry house would involve plenty of poppadums, rice and naan, but i guess i'll be kicking those into touch.",
"a bit of reading suggests a kebab of some sort would be good to start, maybe tandoori chicken with a salad for main, but basically i'm after anybody's advice on what to eat and what not to eat in the curry house, form a low carb perspective cheers nick thanks for all the advice guys.",
"in the end i had a rashmi kebab (a minced lamb pattie with an omelette on top plus salad and yoghurt) then sashlick chicken (chicken tikka pieces with onions, peppers and tomatoes, but no sauce - salad and yoghurt also) plus a side of veggie curry - had to leave the spuds.",
all very nice and i left feeling far less bloated than i normally do after and indian.,
"oh yeah and a couple of kingfishers.......apart from them, still keeping the carbs at bay, and found i'd lost half a stone last week, so that's encouraging",
ok so i'm trying not to unload all my problems on you guys but i would appreciate some serious help.,
as i said i am new to diabetes and have just been diagnosed.,
my name is matt and i'm 21.,
"i have been having really bad problems with confusion, low concentration and depression and was prescribed metformin a while back and for the first two days of taking them my mind became really clear and i had never felt better.",
i was having meaningful conversations with people instead of feeling empty and fuzzy.,
a few days after i went back to the way i was and have not seen that part of me since.,
i'm not sure if this in fact down to my diabetes but if it is some light shed on the situation would be amazing.,
i've been in tears lately over it and would like to get the problem gone i do have a meter but i'm really confused in working it.,
sometime i put the blood on and i get an error so it gets frustrating ok so i just gave it another go and i got 5.5mmol.,
"it seems it does suck the blood on but not enough was gathering when i put it on the strip well i've been feeling like this for quite a while, it was worse when i took that reading because a few hours before i had eaten some roast potatoes with tomato sauce and it made me feel horribly depressed (and by this my head felt abysmal).",
i have been taking antidepressants so i'm wondering if this is contributing to the fuzzy head feeling but as i said it was worse after the pots and sauce.,
"i'm so glad the community here is here gathering around me and helping, i've felt a bit lost and alone ever since i got diabetes.",
most people seem to shy away from the subject if i seek help from friends or family.,
its had me in tears a good few times as well,
i love my pasta and am going to miss it greatly.,
i have been eating seeded wholemeal bread for years as i don't like white bread.,
"as i am losing weight and can't afford to lose any more, i aim to up my fats as some people have suggested on this wonderful site but i am drawing a blank at substituting bread and pasta.",
i see shirataki noodles are okay but i don't know where to get them from.,
i can't find almond flour either!,
asda doesn't seem to cater for diabetes.,
i am going to get some atkins bars in...are they okay?,
i was having porridge for breakfast every morning but see all-bran is better so will get some of that and some peanut butter.,
"i know we are all different and i will learn more when my meter arrives, but who eats bread and pasta on here and of so how much of a portion?",
i am having wholewheat noodles tonight with a bit of bolognese.,
is one or two slices of wholemeal bread considered bad?,
would i be better getting ryvitas in?,
i am sure i will learn more with time and checking myself on the meter but would value your opinion.,
thanks.,
hope you are all having a great sunday!,
"noblehead said: there's a bread called livelife that some low-carbers eat, as an alternative to pasta sheets on a lasagne you could try replacing it with leeks, the hairy bikers did this in their tv series avocado sevenfold said: as noblehead says, veg is a good pasta substitute.",
i use courgette in place of pasta now - either cut julienne or into ribbons.,
for stir fry - bean sprouts in place of noodles.,
peanut butter is good and can be used to make satay sauce or a dip for celery.,
maybe wait for your meter before trying all bran as it is high carb as us the milk you might add to it.,

many thanks.,
will have a go some time this week.,
carty said: celeriac is very useful i use it in lasagne just layer it as you would the pasta you can par boil it for a quicker cooking time i also use caulii but i just cook it until barely cooked and put my bolegnase on top of a few florets with lots of grated cheese instead of a pasta bake cook a variety of veg that you like and then mix with whatever pasta sauce that you use(take care with bought sauces they can be quite carby) cover with grated cheese and oven bake until the top is bubbly and brown you can adapt lots of meals it is just a case of thinking outside of the box!!,

how do people here dispose of their test strips and lancets.,
i have only been testing for just over two days so far but am not sure what i should do with the used test strips and lancets so have them still in the empty strip container.i am using a new lancet every day although they say you should change it every time you test i understand if you get your strips etc on prescription you get a disposal container but as a prediabetic i do not get prescription strips so i have to buy my own thank you everyone,

"im a 21 year old guy who is been training and going to gym for over 3 years and for the past two years i have been eating a lot less than my tdee but i also ate a lot carbs but i never went below 18% body fat and this is really frustrating me but i actually know a lot of people that went to gym and in 6/12 months dropped their body fat percentage to about 10/12% so i went to get my blood tests done and my doctor said that i dont have pre diabetes or diabetes but thank to dr. google and dr. youtube, im 100% sure i have insulin resistance because both my parents only have fat around the midsection and very skinny arms, legs and necks, with no fat at all in those places and exactly the same happened with me and i also found out that a normal diabetes test doesnt say if you are insulin resistant or not.",
"even if i lose weight overall, the midsection doesnt decrease unless i eat very low carbs but with the same calorie deficit, which i did for about 3 weeks and the fat from the midsection started melting away but i had to give it up because it made me feel very weak and depressed plus i do a very physical job and i need to be strong which is something that a diet high in carbs and sugar gives me but having high body fat percentages is giving major depression because i really hate the way i look.",
"people, please help me, is there a medication i can take to decrease the insulin resistance?",
"im willing to start a low carb diet again and take medication that lowers insulin resistance at the same time and slowly increase the amount of carbs i eat, until i hit the point where i dont get into the fat gaining mode so that i can still lose fat around the midsection, reach low body fat percentages, have some carbs and be able to go to work.",

fast heart beat at night also.,

"my doctors and nurse both said to me, that diabetics have weakened immune systems and cant fight infections: e.g.",
where they will catch the common cold and any viral infections faster (just get ill quicker) than non-diabetics and they will heal more slowly etc.,
"my question is once we diabetics get out blood sugar (bs) under tight control, say an hba1c under 5.9%, does this then mean our immune systems are better at fighting of infections and heal better.",
"is there any way that we diabetics can strengthen our immune system, so that it can get back to the normal, e.g say the same as a non-diabetic?",
etc.,
cheers simply.,
i have type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure (controlled by tablets).,
i'm going to take up regular exercise in the gym now and i am thinking of getting myself some injectable anabolic steroids so i wont have any problem packing on the muscle.,
what i want to know is will i been 100% bulletproof safe when i take the steroids?,

so now i'm a bit stuck wondering what's going on.,

i was wondering whether anyone else has suffered these side effects with metformin?,
"would really appreciate any advice x thank you very much for your replies, i think that i just needed some reassurance my hba1c's are usually about 7.5, but it is higher at the moment as i'm breastfeeding and struggling to stick to the diet.",
i went to see a different consultant after i had my baby who put me on metformin as it is now deemed safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding.,
"i am taking 2 x 500mg, one after breakfast and then one after dinner, i haven't really noticed any difference in blood sugars yet, did you notice immediate results?",
"the side effects have been nasty, but i will keep going for another week or so then go back to the docs, he just said that he would see me in 6 months, so don't think he is planning on raising the metformin dose just yet.",
i will also go back to him if my fingers keep fizzing!,

my twelve year old daughter has recently been diagnosed with type 1.,
can anyone tell me if she should be taking certain supplements which may help her condition?,
i have been told by friends who work in complementary medicine that a vitamin d oral spray and digestive enzymes could be given.,
my gp and no one in the medical profession currently dealing with my daughter's condition have mentioned the fact that it is the entire pancreas that has been compromised by the condition and subsequently digestive enzymes would be advisable.,
is this true?,
thank you all for your replies.,
dillinger - i've read the article you linked here and have bookmarked many of its original sources.,
thank you.,

"anybody got any suggestions to help the situation, please?",
"following routine blood tests, glucose was 7 or 7.5 mmol.",
was told needed hba1c doing.,
results of this was 48 mmol/mol of which i was told by gp's receptionist that this was fine and nothing else needs to be done.,
"i am 51, hypertension (medicated), depression (medicated), sleep apnoea (cpap machine) and a few other bits and bobs wrong with me.",
no diabetes in family.,
"however, from what i have read a hba1c of 48 is not where it should be for a non-diabetic.",
have i missed something or is my gp correct?,
i have an appointment to see a different on friday as it does not seem correct to me.,
should i be correct to go back?,
"andy totto said: yes, it is probably correct.",
are you over weight?,
"then reducing weight can reduce blood glucose as well, along with high blood pressure.",
"an easy way to reduce weight is to take away carbohydrates from your diet, including beer, and add good quality fat instead.",
it might work wonders with bg as well.,
it will probably lower your blood pressure and may lift your depression.,
"click to expand... a little over weight around mid-ships, last time did bmi, i think it was 29.",
"i appreciate your comments, and know i need to shed a few pounds.",
i remain a little puzzled over gp's comments though.,

"i have a fasting blood test in the morning, prior to my 6 monthly review next week.",
"i can not stand drinking plain water, is it ok to drink flavoured water?",
"in this heat, i can't not drink anything, as i keep feeling woozy if i get dehydrated.",
"a whole 500ml bottle, contains 6 calories, although i know i won't drink the whole bottle before morning.",
will that affect the results or am i better to go without?,
many thanks.,
"plain water, either from a bottle or a tap, makes me retch.",

i was diagnosed last september with a hba1c of 51.,
"they were not completely sure what type i have, thinking it is genetic, possibly affected by previous strong medications and that i have several other autoimmune issues, but they are treating it as type 2.",
i am on metformin which has been increased to four 500mg pills a day.,
i have also made a lot of dietary changes and have lost 4 stone since diagnosis and got my hba1c down to 37.,
i don't self test.,
my confusion is around carbs and sugar.,
"some things i read say carbs are better because they are slow release energy compared to particularly sugary foods which cause more of a high then crash, but i see so much focus on 'low carb' diets, which make me feel like i'm doing something wrong.",
sorry this has probably been answered many times before but i'm having trouble finding direct answers to my questions and feel like i need someone to answer in a more personal way with my hba1c now being in normal range etc..,
i've read the 'normal' recommended sugar intake allowance per day is around 25g for women but wondered if there is a 'norm' for diabetics?,
obviously cutting out as much bad sugar as possible is ideal.. is there a 'don't eat if over x amount per 100g' for example?,
thank you in advance!,
"i just wanted to say thank you to everyone who has replied to this, it's been interesting and informative to read (also thank you for the encouragement and kind words ) @rokaab and @daisy1 you both mention testing.",
is this something i should be doing as its not been offered by my diabetic nurse or doctor?,
if i can keep my hba1c in the non diabetic range is it necessary to self test?,
"currently my hba1c is now only being tested every 6 months thank you again to those who have replied, it's been very informative and encouraging",
only since i started this metformin ( week 2) and only in the evening..starts at 5pm and goes on and off all evening.,

or i was not on the right track are several questions what about you dear?,
do you feel what i feel?,
i'm losing weight is the worst thing for me i had to change my clothes i agree with you that i have become more interested in my health i think age is a key factor in this someone who eats and drinks what he wants in his life may have lived a lot i think not the same!,

i did bgl testing on our partners back in class and we all did it free hand with lancets that looked exactly like this.,
but what i was curious is that when u do it free hand does the entire needle go in?,
or is it just the tip prick i don't quite remember also can the accu check twist off be used without a device as well p.s - when did the spring activated ones start coming out?,
was it just in the past 2-3 years?,
when i use to donate blood they use to free hand and now a days they use the spring ones of course a new lancet everytime ..!,

its really hard to resist when everyone else is enjoying such things around me.,
"i appreciate her feeding me, its lovely and i don't want to stop others enjoying her delicious food.",
but how do i get through to her that i can't eat such things without causing offence or potentially loosing one of my few friends i have?,

bluetit1802 said: you have no choice but to take the bull by the horns and talk to her.,
explain your condition is carb intolerance and that when you eat carbs your bs levels go sky high and this is very bad for your health.,
( if by chance she watched that panorama programme the other week she may have some idea of what you are facing if you don't control matters.),
if she has no idea you shouldn't eat carbs then she needs to know.,

"brunneria said: only you know your friend and the situation, but i am a bloody minded old bird, and i value my health enough to get my point across - though i would have to think long and hard about how to do it.",
"depending on the friend, i might - take my own large salad and eat it out of the tupperware, while stabbing the chunks of meat out of the stew with my fork - leaving the dumplings, the gravy and the root veg behind - invite her over instead of going there, and serve my food, explaining why.",
"- stop going - explain, openly and clearly, that carbs are bad for me (for all you know, she has been busily looking up carb-stuffed diabetic recipes online and thinks she is giving you superbly diabetic foods.",
there are a lot of recipes like that on the diabetes uk charity website - because they think carbs are good. ),
- simply stay 'i can't eat that.,
can i just have a ham salad?',
"- give her some recipes or the web address of some diet doctor recipes - eat before i go, so that i don't even want her stew... we have an interesting situation going on with my in laws.",
none of them know that i am t2.,
i'm not hiding it.,
"i just don't want the aggro, confusion and fuss that will accompany the revelation, and strangely i have never raised the subject .",
and i can't face the sympathy.,
i don't feel i need any sympathy - but they would offer it - in spades.,
so we gently manipulate things (it isn't hard!),
to always take them out to places i know i can find something.,
luckily pops loves carveries.,

so i guess my friend is getting mixed messages.,
"i guess i'm going to have to be tough, sit them all down together, print off all the information necessary for all of them, produce their own individual packs, try and explain things again with stronger emphasis and hope it finally sinks in.",
"i think i'm going to have similar problems when it comes to my family, they know but thats as far as it gets, like you their find things out as and when needed, i've already had my sister expecting me not to ask for a diabetic/lchf diet at her sons wedding as she dosn't want that putting the bill up, caring ahh?",

"hi folks just got back from a weekend to a very sunny blackpool, had a fantastic time,but, didn't realise that it was sunny as was cloudy and didn't feel at all hot.",
"any to cut a long story short, i got sunburnt, shoulders across back of neck and down arms to elbow, jeeze its sooooo sore.",
"but would gettin sunburn effect my blood sugars, have just managed to get them under better control, and an now averaging in the 6's, but since yesterday my sugars have gone up greatly, in the 10's at mostly every reading and wondered if the sunburn could be to blame as not eating any different, yes i did relax my diet a bit over the weekend, but would have thought my bloods would fluxuate, and not contatantly be high thanks in advance juliexx p.s.",
"next time am goin abroad, never got sunburnt in my life before and i will admit today i have cried like a baby due to the pain!!!!.",
but the old remedy of strong cold tea really works!!!,
"hi nigel blackpool was great, better than i expected, i havn't been there since i was about 10yrs old some erm.....30 odd yrs ago was a spare of the moment thing and britanina hotel had a late deal on so we went for it.",
"the weather was ok so i thought, hot enough to walk round comfortably, yeah right burnt to a crisp lol the hotel we stayed at was ok it look fantastic from the outside but on the inside was like fawlty towers lol, we had a jacuzzi bath and in a mad drunken moment i decided to have a bath at silly oclock in the morning and put bubble bath in it, omg, bubbles everywhere we were invaded as they seeped all over the bathroom floor my hubby was livid and used a whole can of deodrient to get rid of the bubble so then we spent the next few hours not being able to breathe due to the spray as the bathroom had no window!!!",
"the entertainment/cabaret show was so awful it was good if that makes sense, havn't laughed so much in years so all in all a very good weekend apart from the sunburn!!",
"would i go again, you bet i would juliex hi nigel it was the norbreck castle hotel which is part of the britania group of hotels it looks fantastic, like a castle from the outside but the inside omg well ppl need to see it for themselves lol cant complain though had a great time!!",
juliex p.s.,
"my hubby was mortified wen we got to our room, he like to be pampered with at least 4* luxury, but u get wat u pay for, as long as it has a bed, bath/shower and loo then am happy lol @anniep yes our room was clean, although some of the reviews on the tinternet say an awful lot about the hotel, but we found it clean/tidy but very dated and i wouldn't stay longer than a couple of days.",
"obviously if u want 5* treatment then u dont go to stay in this hotel, but it was a last minute decision, booked thursday night arrived 3pm on the friday and left sunday am, 70 quid for both of us for dinner bed and breakfast and 1hr free bar each night, plus the shocking entertainment which was hilarious after a couple of vodka's havn't laughed so much in ages!!",
"we did upgrade to eat in the more classy restaurant on the saturday, my hubby is a chef and he refused point blank to use the self service one again, an no where not on commission or anything to do with the hotel, my original post was about sunburn, but thought i'd share the experience we had oh yes nigel luv programmes like that but now am looking at putting my hubby on the naughy step indefinately, well he has been most helpful the last couple of days due to my dreadful sunburn (the pain so bad today went to gp who sent me to hospital who gave me some cream, dressed my back and shoulders and i now have to attend the burns clinic on thursday) but back to the hubby, he has taken the week off work and is helpin out more, or looking after me as he puts it!!!!",
"gonna strangle him, not only has he broke the hoover, he never sorted out the washing and now we have pink oven clothes, pink knickers, pink bra's, pink tea towells, pink tee shirts and blue and pink jeans oh the joys so we didn't save any money on the cheapo holiday as we've now got to replace the hoover and all the clothes, hes now been banned from any applicance at home till he returns to work on monday!!!",
juliex,
hello again everyone can someone please help with this; my hubby has been complaining lately of feeling wobbly and tripping when walking.,
he loses concentration too and is quite irritable.,
his blood sugar is alright-bw 6.5-6.7 before meals.,
what could be the cause?,
"he is on metfomin three times daily, glicazide once a day and simvastin at night only.",
merry christmas everyone and thank you very much for the response.,
i have advised him to make an appointment with doc to check statin dosage because even he has been complaining about it.,
thanks.,
i've just read http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/222766.php and thought i'd ask you guys what you think.,
is type 2 also an autoimmune disease too?,
nocarbs4me said: maybe sometimes.,
click to expand... as well as insulin resistant or rather than being insulin resistant?,
nocrbs4me said: who knows?,
some people can reverse their type 2 with a change in diet while others can't.,
maybe the ones that can't have a autoimmune disease.,
click to expand... you may be right.,
"i have had bell's palsy, underactive thyroid and pcos.",
now type2 which seems to be progressive no matter what my diet.,
"meat and fat only, veg and fish, gi carbs and veg or everything and anything.",
"i envy diabetics who lose weight, mine moves a few pounds then bounces back to highest weight again.",
i tried meal replacements early last year with no affect.,
anorexia (as in loss of appetite) will help me lose weight but i'll still be diabetic!,
thanks @sud5nala .,
are autoantibodies influenced by stress or inflammation?,
or any variable?,
looking around the net.,
a few sufferers are blood group a- (negative).,
i'm a-.,
are you?,
i'd like to think if all negative that that would have been the conclusion from the start.,
"hence, only hereditary.",
i'm negative but i've produced positive babies.,
"neither of which are showing any signs of diabetes, to date.",
if they meet a negative partner their children could be negative or positive.,
genetic!,
is diabetes a flaw in negative blood groups.,
a blood disorder?,
"hi all, i am not a big drinker.",
"weddings, special events and the odd weekend (once every few months at most) are really the only times.",
"been diagnosed t1 for 8 months now, and since ive been on insulin, ive experienced something odd.",
"ive had 4 drinking sessions this year, 3 big events, and 1 weekend session (yesterday).",
"i have been blackout drunk each time, not remembering the night before at all.",
"i thought the first few times it was down to the volume of drink (which is a reasonable assumption, knowing the volume i did drink).",
"yesterday, however, i had around 16 units over a 5 hour period (too much, probably, but not ridiculous based on what i drank pre t1)!",
"i do not remember getting home (i was with the mrs, so was safe), or injecting when i came home, but checked my meter and i did check my blood.",
"has anyone experienced this, and of course other than drinking less, does insulin have an effect with alcohol to cause these blackouts?",
p.s.,
i am so embarrassed about being 'that guy'.,
hi i am new to the forums i have type1 diabetes i have had it for 8 years nearly just wanted to ask if anybody has any advice on high blood sugars and ketones and when the best time is to go to hospital if i can't get it under control i had an infection last week but seems like my bloods and ketones don't want to settle down any1 able to help out i would appreciate it thanks.,
:-/ thank you i have it before but always been able to manage it before it got really bad this time round it just seems like it doest want to play ball just had some more insulin as bg is 29.0 and ketones in blood are currently at 1.5 dashing.,
said: what are yours on at the moment?,
usually i'd ring mine if i had 1.5 or above =.= click to expand... ketones are currently running at 1.2 i think and bg is running at 29.0 just don't no what to do for the best at the min dashing.,
"said: drink plenty of water, and make sure to keep an eye every hour on your sugar x good luck click to expand... dazza1984 said: careful with just injecting more insulin.",
too much and you can force a temp hypo; then ur liver reacts by dumping sugars into ur blood.,
advice and monitoring ~each hour will help.,
click to expand...,
thank you for that advice as silly as it sounds i never really thought of it that way i always got toldif you have high bg and ketones to get more insulin in dashing.,
said: just ring 111 for advice they will most likly tell you to come in so they can get your sugars down should be in there for 5 hours max good luck x click to expand... just hoping to get them down and as long as i don't start being sick all should be fine if that makes sense i will give it another hour see what they are likethen just have the thought of having to go to hospital thank you for your help x dazza1984 said: well more insulin is kinda right but not too much.,
also there is a delayed reaction to the insulin.,
not like taking an inhaler etc.,
so you could inject 10iu and within the hour be en route to normal; but then an hr later have a hypo etc click to expand... that is good advice this is the worst it's been in a while last time i had to go to hospital was nearly 5 years ago been off work for nearly 2 week which is killing me i feel perfectly fine,
anyone else's blood sugar levels rise in the cold weather ?,
just noticed recently mine have been creeping up when i'm really cold,
"doing the weekly shop this morning and trawling through the aisles i came across ""diabetic"" jams and spreads upon inspecting them closer i found they actually contain a hell of a lot of the things we're told to avoid or minimise... even having it at its rda would of been ridiculous.",
has anyone else found this peculiar?,
i couldn't quite believe what i was seeing!,
i might as well of just sat and poured a 2lb bag of sugar down my throat it was that ridiculous.,
bulkbiker said: i've been having a big row with waitrose (sorry) about franks diabetic ice cream which they still have on their shelves even though by december in theory it should not be permitted to sell it.,
i'm really miffed because they have that rubbish but stopped having oppo at my local.,
click to expand...,
there was an article about this so called war with suppliers of diabetic foodstuffs in the local rag last week you might find it interesting.,
i'll find it you.,
brunneria said: i think one of the first things most of us t2s are told by our health care staff is to steer well clear of anything labelled 'diabetic'.,
"they are usually low sugar, with lots of other carbs many of which are laxative, low fat, and full of rubbish and additives.",
diabetic chocolate is an abomination.,
and the icecream isn't even worth the name.,
one of the things i like most about www.dietdoctor.com is the emphasis on natural and unprocessed foods.,
these threads kind of sum it up : http://www.diabetes.co.uk/forum/thr...etics-labelling-outlawed.104928/#post-1210679 http://www.diabetes.co.uk/forum/threads/boots-diabetic-food-range.86222/#post-975076 http://www.diabetes.co.uk/forum/thr...do-you-differentiate.85303/page-2#post-962206 click to expand... my diabetic nurse must of been absent the day they were told to say that because i've always been encouraged!,
!,
i've amassed quite a ridiculous number of blood glucose meters (fully working) over the years and was wondering if someone has recent knowledge of charities that might be interested in such?,
"same with lancet devices, boxes of pen needles...?",
thank you.,
so...,
"if anyone else is wondering what to do with a surplus of d paraphernalia: iddt is happy to get unused meters & lancets, unfortunately they cannot take used ones.",
bit of a shame as this rules out quite a few of mine (why do i have 4 contours...?,
"), but no can do.",
"pen needles they can use as well, a fine new home for my pre-pump stash.",
hah!,
"i kinda did that for a ba project (film, photography, & digital media) a long time ago and got a really **** score.",
"admittedly, it was a last minute divine inspiration (desperation) sort of thing but damien hirst has nothing on me... ah ok anna29 (ugh.",
forgotten how to link name properly) - would be great if they can use all of it.,
you think the note about the used vs unused is sort of 'cosmetic'?,
"to my email about meters etc (lancets, in/out of date pen needles) i got this reply: ""thank you for getting in touch.",
"i am afraid that we can only use the unused meters to send to africa but they would be much appreciated if you could send them to the address below.""",
"and next, after prodding further about (unused) lancets and (in date) pen needles: ""we can certainly use the lancets and pen needles to send to tanzania.""",
guess i can just post it all to them.,
just didn't want to merely pass the trouble of disposing unwanted stuff.,
what's the point with expiry dates on pen needles anyway?!,
"enclave - dead wildlife eh, interesting .",
"the marvellous piece (ok, debatable) i did was shot with medium format camera, might have the negs somewhere back home (in finland)... will check next time i'm there .",
and if i get inspired with current mountain of pump **** i'll post the results!,
"i posted sometime ago about my friend who is type 2, at the time she had stopped taking her metformin, due to severe gastro-intestinal side effects, she was getting spikes into the high teens and probably averaging about 9.5/10; her appetite has always been very poor which doesn't help.",
"recently things have improved significantly, the advice i received here being very helpful, her overall levels tend to be in high single figures with the occassional spike into low-mid teens, she recently saw her consultant and he prescribed sitagliptin as monotherapy and told her that if that didn't work she would have to commence insulin.",
"she commenced the sitagliptin on monday, unfortunately she on wednesday she developed extreme side effects-swollen face, to the extent of blinding her, and breathing difficulties, particularly worrying as she is a chronic asthmatic, obviously the sitagliptin has been stopped but is to re-commence next wednesday; what i would like to ask is, has any experienced these side effects and subsequently re-commenced the drug and was it successful the second time around.",
"her previous experience of using insulin, whilst pregnant was horrendous for her and can only be described as neglect, i discovered by chance that although she was vaguely aware of a hypo she wasn't sure what it was, how to recognise it,or how to deal with it, i've dealt with that, she was left to inject alone, after a brief demonstration, for 8 weeks whilst waiting to give birth in a maternity ward, she still finds the memory traumatic.",
"given her understandable fear of injecting again, which we will overcome if we have to, and her very poor appetite, there is a lot riding on the sitagliptin so any experiences would be very valuble,thanks everyone for taking the time to read this.",
"(unfortunately she doesn't want to join the forum so i'm the proxy) paul angiodema, exfoliating skin conditions, upper respiratory tract infections and nasopharyngitis are all recognised side effects of sitagliptin therapy.",
"i had the opportunity to discuss this with a pharmacist i know and she could find no reference to anyone developing tolerance to the drug subsequent to side effects appearing, in fact she felt that once sensitised the chances were that these would reccur.",
"given my friends medical history i am ofthe opion that the drug should not be recommenced unless she is admitted to hospital for monitoring, otherwise she will alone at home with a 4 year child.",
i thought i'd give everybody an update on this.,
"the doctor who told my friend to recommence the sitagliptin was the gp at her local surgery, he takes a special interest in diabetes, eventually i was able to persuade to contact her consultant before taking the drug again, she was reluctant as she didn't want to offend her gp but i prevailed.",
"her consultant told her that under no circumstances was she to recommence sitagliptin and to do so could be extremely dangerous in her case, especially given the breathing difficulties she experienced within the context of chronic asthma, she was also informed that she was the second person to present with this side effect profile, at this particular hospital, this year.",
"she has an appointment to see her consultant at the beginning of august, he's on holiday until then, and she will probably start on insulin; she's dreading this but i'm hopeful that we can overcome her fears and get her stabilised at last.",
thanks for all your support and advise.,
paul,
i'm curious.,
i have spent an hour or two browsing this and other related websites today in the hope i would find some useful information about low carb plans for type 1's.,
"i did okay i guess but i think it blatantly obvious for anyone thinking of going this route then regular testing is an absolute must, in my opinion.",
"then i got onto these new, to me, monitoring systems as i thought they would help - until i discovered the price.",
"'chuff my buffers' said thomas, i thought the freestyle was dear enough at almost 60 per (dubious) sensor until i called dexcom about their g6 system.",
the very pleasant girl on the phone told me 160 per month - every month!!,
almost 2000 a year!!,
"and in response to 'why so expensive' she assured me that this was cheaper than the previous model, politely delivered in a tone that hinted i should be grateful.",
"is it just me (and it could easily be) or are some large, probably american, companies taking the urine because they know we'd like to manage our condition better or because they know the nhs may well adopt their systems?",
having read many of the comments about these on this site i do wonder how so many people can afford them.,
i'm jealous as i can't!,
thanks for the reply - sounds like you've had both types then.,
i apologise as i should have stated that i thought the freestyle meter was quite a reasonable price but i still have to wonder why their sensors are as expensive as a new meter though.,
it's the first time in 30 years as a diabetic i actually feel that some unscrupulous company is actually trying to take advantage or profit from my inherited 'condition'.,
"bless them, one can only wish them well!",
"hello, so got my blood ketone meter and tested my ketones and it kept flashing lo blood is 7.6 though is that anything to worry about??",
sent from the diabetes forum app it didnt really say anything just that if it hi to seek medical attention but i know that anyway!,
"jackois said: 'lo' is, as engineer88 says, 0.3 or better.... so no worries there.",
click to expand...,
okay then phewww great!,
i'm well aware of what to do when it is high haha had it 3 times before lol!,
just not used to it being 0 lol!!,
"all is good haha and yes glucomen lx i think it was because it was flashing and making the noise haha noblehead said: if your ketone meter is showing low and your bg level is 7.6 then you have nothing to worry about, if it's the meter is the glucomen lx plus it just means your levels are outside the range that the meter can read which is below 0.1mmol, on the opposite end of the scale if your ketone levels were above 8.0mmol then the meter would flash hi.",
getting a lo reading is good btw click to expand... phewww worry over than haha!,
hello .,
.,

a specific question to those freestyle libre early-adopters: is it possible to configure the libre to show measurements in mg/dl ?,
or are models sold in uk fixed to show only in mmol/l ?,
the background is that i am in germany where the libre seems to be currently unavailable**.,
"i would very much like to try out this machine for myself, and can easily get it delivered to uk family address before getting it shipped out here.",
but having been out here for so long i am thinking only in mg/dl and would like for the measurements to be displayed as such.,
"i know that on most machines you can configure it how you want - but i notice that the libre has only 1 button, so i wondered if it was possible?",
can anyone advise?,
"thanks & regards, antony ** if anyone knows different, please tell me logindetails said: i think the libre is available in germany, it's listed at 169,90 on http://www.freestylelibre.de/de-kit-product-mg.html click to expand... a-ha!",
"thank you, mr details!",
my mistake was to start from the abbott .co.uk page .,
.,
.,
when i clicked on the freestyle libre product it linked to a page saying that this is not available in my location .,
.,
.,
hmm .,
.,
.,
i guess this is telling me that the mmol/l configured machine is not available in germany?,
not sure .,
.,
.,
"anyway, if i start from the .de homepage then i can link to the freestyle libre mg/dl machine no problem, and pop it in my basket if i wish .",
.,
.,
thanks!,
"regards, antony",
i am not exactly sure how to start this ...,
i was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about one year ago ...,
i am having severe brain fog and mental breakdowns weekly ...,
i am embarrassed to say this ... but i just don't know where else to turn ... my blood sugar has ranged from 438 to 180 ...,
i am exercising hard and trying to keep a low carb diet ... but i just cannot not eat carbs ...,
i hurt too bad emotionally when i don't eat them ...,
i am constantly miserable trying to not eat them ...,
i feel terrible ... then i eat carbs and feel horrible as my blood sugar rises ... about 2x per week now i am having literally mental breakdowns and crying uncontrollably to the point of vomitting ...,
"i am a mess ... my work is suffering, my relationships with my kids is suffering ...",
i used to be smart ... now i am just flat dumb ...,
i just cannot think ...,
i don't even know how someone is supposed to respond to this ... this is a desperate attempt ...,
i can't even come up with an articulate way to describe this other than ...,
i just cannot think ...,
i appreciate your help very much.,
thanks for the reply.,
i had a discussion with my doctor a few days ago and i still feel like crying about it.,
"i asked for the amounts of insulin and needles to be increased so i didn't have to visit the pharmacist so often, they insisted they couldn't, launched into a review of what i was using and ended up reducing the amounts i receive.",
yet another example of how out of touch they are with what i actually need.,
i feel like it's all about meeting their targets with them and my needs and wishes don't matter.,
i haven't seen a specialist in years for this reason and only see the doctor when i absolutely have to.,
"i know you're meant to have the doctors keep an eye on your condition but i feel beaten up and hopeless when i deal with them, i just avoid them as much as i can.",
does anyone else feel this way?,
"hi, thanks for your reply.",
i just posted another thread with the details of the quantities of medication they will provide and how it affects me.,
sorry i don't know how to link to it here else i would.,
"i'm asking two things at once here, which is why i just made the other thread for the practical side of it.",
i was also wondering if anyone else has these kinds of disempowering and degrading experiences with their doctors and how you cope with that.,
"i keep leaving feeling that my needs are irrelevant in the face of their targets, agendas and whatever else they want to do.",
it doesn't seem like the nhs services are really there for me.,
"hello guys, i have been diabetic since the age of 14.",
managed it properly for the first year then did not bother putting an effort.,
"i am now 21, with the thoughts of neuropathy, complications and quite frankly death hunting me and making me second guess a career in medicine.",
do you think that a proper control can reverse any possible damage or does it only prevent further damage?,
well the thing is no dr will give me a conclusive answer.,
they will simply tell me to start taking care of myself without answering the question.,
"and no, no signs yet, just lathargy.",
"yes you are probably right, and mentality plays a key role...why not boxing sounds interesting.",
i'll give it a try.,
thank you,
"i have seen this bread in my local supermaket ""burgen soya / linseed bread"" says low gi do anybody know the gl load.",
ok just found a gi reading is 36 so 36 x 11.9 / 100 = 1 slice 4.284 gl's that's pretty low 8) great link many thanks :wink: at the moment in my local shop it 1.33 a loaf but must say worth every penny taste great!!!!!!,
!,
"ok i'm not sure i understand this yet, so can someone please define or correct me?",
blood ketones is a sign of too high bg and a warning you may be heading (or already in) dka?,
"urine ketones is a sign that your body is burning fat to use as an energy source and therefore your in ketosis - this is not necessarily a reflection of where your bg are at, but that you are not eating ""enough"" carbohydrates to cover your bodies energy needs - common in low carb diets.",
is that right or have i got completely the wrong end of the stick?,
re: blood ketones vs urine ketones vs ketosis vs ketoacidosi thank you so much for clearing that up for me.,
hi i read on a thread yesterday and also in the blurb with my metformin that you shouldn't have xrays if you are taking metformin.,
i had an xray last thursday and wasn't aware of this - does anyone know if this will cause a problem?,
they didn't ask if i was on any medication before having it.,
thanks for your help chris hi sue can't find the thread now it was either in expert or discussion bit and someone listed the side effects to metformin and it said about xray.,
i had mammogram so should be ok by the sounds of it.,
unfortunately even in the blurb with tabs it just says xray doesn't mention the type which is a bit misleading.,
thanks for the response.,
chris,
hi this is not particularly diabetes related (although i am diabetic) does anyone take clopidogrel for reduce risk of stroke/ heart disease?,
i was just wondering if anyone had any side effects especially women.,
my particular problem is my periods have become so heavy since being on it.,
i can't find any information on this as it all seems to be aimed at post menopause women.,
thanks didie.,
yes the bruises are epic arn't they!,
i had a tia in august so it is good for peace of mind.,
both my parents died of heart/stroke so was scared when i had the tia.,
i will have to go to the doctor although i don't really want to take another tablet i am on quite a lot already for diabetes etc.,
i only 35 so got quite a few years of periods to go so will have to get it sorted!,
hello everyone my hb1ac levels are 6.2.,
i was on metformin 500 mg er for 6 months and it did not do what it claimed.,
- i did not lose any weight - it did not suppress my appetite - my morning fasting levels remained high ( between 6.8- 8.0) i am going to the gp this week to ask for an alternative that may help me.,
my biggest concern is weight.,
i eat healthy and exercise every day and cant lose any weight.,
"while my hb1ac is only in pre diabetes range that may not require medical attention, my fasting sugar levels in the morning are high and can be classified as within diabetes range.",
"i spoke to another gp for a second opinion and she told me i could do without any medication because everything is fine in terms of thyroid, cholesterol and blood pressure.",
my body is not processing food correctly because no matter what i eat im not full even really low carb foods and when i get full i get sleepy.,
should i ask for janumet?,
a combination of metformin and sitagliptin?,
i need something to lose weight and supress hunger and also lower my sugar levels.,
just upsetting metformin didnt help.,
has anyone tried anything when metformin was not working for them?,
thankyou for replying!,
i mix and match with the following.,
please tell me whether this is appropriate food for a pre diabetic/ diabetic with insulin resistance.,
"i mix and match with the following foods for breakfast lunch and dinner, so each meal for breakfast, or lunch or dinner obviously not all in one day!!",
"hahah quinoa bean salad baked egg in roasted capsicum shakshuka ( 2 baked eggs with tomato simmer sauce and mixed beans, avocado) roasted egg plant ( 2 long slices) with tomatos, mozzarella cheese and basil leaves.",
"spinach and mushroom quiche roasted zucchini tomatos, mozzarella cheese and basil leaves.",
1 slice of toast with peanut butter and protein shake for breakfast ( this is never really filling) this is what i will eat over the course of one week mixing and match what do you think?,
i am still hungry?,
while hb1ac is 6.2 my fasting sugar levels every morning at 6.8-8.0 and 1 hour after a meal they sky rocket to 11.0 !!!!,
what could this mean?,
metformin did not help over the 6 months should i ask for janumet?,
any other oral drug you can think of?,
i dont want to try injections yeh i certainly think some form of treatment is required as diet and exercise alone is not enough at the moment.,
so will continuing the diet and increasing metformin with januvia so janument help with the appetite?,
does metformin stop working when you eat lots of carbs?,
i remember there was a time where i would have over 250 g of carbs everyday not realising how bad it was for me.,
i use to sometimes have 3 bananas esspecially before going to bed and i did not lose any weight rather i gained despite being on the medication.,
is this all to do with the high carb intake?,
"i have recently been told i am border line diabetic, and need to follow a low carb diet.",
i have been reading articles until i'm blue in the face!,
"information on the rear of foods shows total carbs, carbs from fibre and sugars from carbs.",
sugars from carbs i understand are the ones i need to watch.,
but if you add these up they do not total the 'total carbs.,
"i have tried adding the protein, fat and salt to sugars and fibre but this still does not add up.",
i just feel i need to grasp the whole picture.,
if anyone can help i would appreciate it.,
"thanks ok thanks, i did see the diabetic nurse, but she just showed me some charts with foods not to eat.",
how many total carbs a day should i aim for?,
and i presume i can have a slice of bread once a week?,
i have recently been finding sweet potatoe fries give me ok readings 2 hours after meals.,
i now have them when eating out a lot.,
i have quite good portion sizes as well.,
i just cant accept that these tasty fries and a decent amount of them can be good!,
i am testing 2 hours after and get between 5.5-7.3 blood readings.,
i have been told anything under 7.8 2 hours after is what to aim for.,
could my sugars still be rising after 2 hours?,
i havent tested after 2 hours but do still feel full and satisfied.,
is it bad to get a really high one hour spike but then goes to normal range after 2 hours?,
i havent tested after an hour either.,
can these tasty treats really be ok?,
or are they to good to be true,
"hello everyone, i am from australia and currently performing some enquiries about the management of diabetes and how oral health is advocated towards patients.",

"currently, only podiatrists, dieticians, occupational therapists and diabetes educators are the only health allies who are utilized by most doctors.",
"i can see this is going to be a long and ongoing push in terms of changing the medical perceptions to make not only oral health, but other health facets available to patients.",
i am glad hear that you are all at least aware of the dental implications with diabetes and use support sites like this one for your own guidance.,
"our plans are inclined to helping our general practitioners with better information packages to give to newly diagnosed diabetics, as well as a referral timeline.",
"as there are so many new life changes and health assessments involved once a patient has been diagnosed, perhaps a structured plan would benefit both the patient and medical practitioner.",
"you have all given me some very good food for thought, once again thank-you.",
these are very interesting thoughts.,
"it seems like many of you find it hard to find a ""nhs"" dentist.",
i gather that these types of dentists provide cheaper or free services as they are subsidised by the government?,
"we have a similar system here, however dental care is not covered, so for most diabetics, they have to pay for their own dental expenses.",
this just opens a whole new can of worms in regards to the affordability of regular dental care and how much governments can contribute to cover the costs.,

fingers crossed that someone out there will like our proposal and potentially form some action on our recommendations.,

i live of pasta potato rice etc.,
i wasn't particularly active when it came to exercise although that has changed now.,
this has been going on for years now tho.,
"i recently asked gp for certain blood tests to be carried out and got back results which showed there were problems which could explain why my insulin levels were so low at one time but i think, maybe not diabetes.",
i am waiting to see a specialist but was just wondering if anyone else had found them in such a position (where type 1 diagnosis is reversed) or know anyone else who has experienced it.,
:grin: many thanks sent from the diabetes forum app hi laura and thanks for the reply.,
i have pushed for certain tests that did come back as i expected and have been referred to a specialist in hormones and how they affect each other.,
depending on the amount and types of food i have consumed during the day i adjust the amount of insulin i take at night.,
i am still suffering from hypos though now more than ever so i have started a better diet and exercise so i can take little if any insulin at night.,
when i was first diagnosed my bg was through the roof!,
and i have relied on insulin initially.,
however if more investigations were carried out at the time i believe that they would have found that other things were causing my insulin production and high bg levels for example the tests they are carrying out now.,
my gp also seemed shocked when he found out that these investigations were not carried out at the time either.,
especially as i got the diagnosis at a relatively unusual age and at a time when i was extremely fit and healthy.,
if i am honest i have never believed i had type 1 diabetes so never learned much about it.,
i thought i was type 2 at worst.,
however i put that down to myself being in denial.,
i did the research myself and looked at how i could find out.,
my gp has been very supportive and informative.,
i am waiting to see the specialist now but just looking to see if anyone had experience of his situation thank you once again :grin: sent from the diabetes forum app will do.,
thanks again x it makes interesting reading thank you.,
there are also contact details of specialists in the field as it seems very rare.,
i have taken contact details and will give them a call.,
if it's not mody then they may have some insight as to what it maybe.,
thank you once again :smile: x sent from the diabetes forum app i am sorry i really don't know what most of what you said meant :-( i have recently found out i have problems with other hormones in my body either over or under production.,
this is what the recent tests are for.,
i am and have always questioned my type 1 diagnosis due to the lack of insulin i've had to take over the yrs.,
as hormones tend to have a knock on effect to each other i have raised the question of type 1 with my gp.,
he has said it needs to be spoken about with the specialist when i see him / her.,
as for everything you just mentioned.,
"because diabetes has had such a minimal impact on my life during the 15yrs of diagnosis i ve really not educated myself in it, just going for tests etc when requested!",
never chased up results and as they've never come looking for me i am assuming things were ok. poor attitude i know but i hate diabetes as it had such a massive effect on my prospects once i was initially diagnosed.,
for example i was out of the raf on 6mths compassionate leave / discharge and got diagnosed 1 month before re entering which prevented me re enlisting!,
gutted.,
also any other jobs that interested me back then we're all impossible to do with a type 1 diagnosis.,
so although it's had no long term effect on my life it damaged the bigger initial part of me and my future massively.,
"so i am totally un educated in tests, results, types of insulin and jargon.",
sorry but thanks for attempting to help answer my question sent from the diabetes forum app many thanks.,

how accurate are home blood pressure monitors vs the gp's monitor?,
a mate of mine just found out his home meter was out by 15 points compared to that of his gp.,
this is about 10% or so.,
but which is in error?,
maybe both are?,
i know i can calibrate my glucose meter but am not aware of a simple accurate way to check the bp.,
he wants to know because of the acceptance threshold for the services.,
all comments gratefully received.,
thanks for that.,
i wonder who checks the mercury one then?,
no measurement equipment can be deemed accurate in absolute terms unless it is measured against a standard.,
this should be regularly checked.,
"i think he experienced something like this today, will report back.",
thanks for all the comments and very sorry to hear that claire.,
hope they can do something for you asap.,
dunno why but i get so rattled when in the gp's.,
"maybe having to sit in the waiting room for ages with all the usual types, the vacuous muzak on local radio, ****** mags, screaming kids, etc has something to do with it.",
my mate does not seem to exhibit white coat syndrome nor do my kids thankfully.,
i like to think i am not scared of anyone but my bp says otherwise.,
"mind you, when you are in there discussing dm and the nhs policies on it one's blood can start to simmer...8) emphasis on the 'or' in fight or flight then.",
also i often feel myself wanting to 'do well'.,
an odd notion that i hate.,
whatever the case it is a stress factor that heisenberg would no doubt find amusing.,
8) oh dear.,
another assumption wrong - re glucose meter calibration.,
such a range is indeed worrying.,
i have always had this suspicion about the error in these gadgets.,
i used to do a lot of lab measurements - in physics not bio - and 'drift' we called it was a major concern.,
one of instruments had to be cal checked twice a day.,
i suspected that these little meters built for a price would not be accurate for long and yet we build our lives around them.,
it is almost not worth thinking about.... maybe some are more reliable than others.,
maybe none are.,
maybe some are ok when you buy them but i have had mine for over a year.,
should i get a new one?,
it also worries me that i will not be able to find anyone in the nhs with a clue.,

ketones and high blood sugar could mean that you're urinating frequently and it smells bad.,

"tettenhall boy said: for a start off, re: stinky wee, try boiling the water first to leach out the chemicals or use mineral water.",
alcohol also contributes to a pungent smell.,

munchers said: silly question but you don't say if you are confirmed diabetic?,
if you are why can't you test your blood?,
sent from the diabetes forum app click to expand... daibell said: hi.,
i think you need to get your blood sugar tested fairly urgently; try a chemist or a gp etc.,
"ref ketones, buy some ketostix or similar product from a chemist.",
if you have high blood sugar and your body is not producing enough insulin your body may be burning fats rather than carbs.,
this combined with the ketones that burning fats produces can be dangerous if extreme.,
you may just be having the wrong diet currently i.e.,
too many carbs but there is always the background possibility that your diagnosis is late onset type 1 (lada) so it's wise to check yourself out just in case.,
have plenty of fluids and if you start to feel unwell get to a&e.,

i have just checked with what remaining test strips i have left and my blood sugars are at 19.3 and is surprisingly high for me.,
my doctor refused me a prescription for test strips last week saying i won't be needing to test.,
would i need to buy anything else with the ketostix as i am currently on a budget.,
"lucypieee said: if you are a type 2 diabetic, it may be an idea to revisit your gp, as you may need an adjustment to your medication or even be type 1.5 now... definitely get the ketostix, your gp will also be able to test for ketones if you make an appointment.",

i don't think that i am type 1.5 and in the past week i have been drinking quite alot of alcohol from being dragged to parties for the past 4 nights.,

"i'm 50 now , been type 1 diabetic for over 40 years now.",
the last 2 1/2 years of which i've been on a pump !,
"i recently suffered a serious vomiting episode which with the bug that brought it on, caused dka- something i'd not had the displeasure of until then .",
i was put onto a drug called omeprazol 2 in the morning and 2 in the evening.,
these are 20mg tablets so i was on 80mg a day.,
my sister who is a nurse practitioner queried why i was on such a massive dose ?,
i asked my gp who told me to continue taking them until told differently.,
this was in mid november.,
i was admitted to hospital twice in a 2 week period once for 6 days and the second time only for 2 days.,
i was still taking the drugs as instructed and then after about 4 to 6 weeks i started suffering the most awful hypo's!,
this was even shortly after eating which i was somewhat concerned about.,
about 3 hours later my bloods ( which i check religiously ) would go through the roof -- high !,
i eventually said to my sister that all these things that had happened for last three weeks or so had only happened after i'd been put on the omeprazol for my reflux.,
we looked at the paperwork and halfway through approximately 6 of the things ( that only happen to 1/10000 people ) were happening to me on a daily basis .,
dry throat & mouth.,
ends of fingers cracking up.,
blood sugars dropping dramatically after eating then raising massively approx 3 hrs later.,
being confused and hallucinating.,
( not nice at all ! ),
"sweating and being generally ""off colour"".",
i attempted to contact my diabetes nurse to discuss this and she said.,
loads of people are on this drug who are diabetic.,
"i replied "" christ that's marvellous "".",
i must be a special one !,
not heard anymore since.,
really just wondered if anyone else out there had suffered anything like myself ?,
since discovering about the drugs .,
i stopped taking them and these things all seemed to cease very rapidly !,
regards ian campbell leong said: hi is the pump use for belly issue and if so can it give you high blood sugar readings thanks click to expand... no the pump is purely for my diabetes control - very good too !,

"as a long term diabetic, i always remember the dire warnings given at diagnosis about wearing the wrong shoes, the damage it could do to your feet, taking care of your feet, etc.",

i recently rediscovered dr martens after 20 years and had forgotten how good the soles are.,

"all i meant was i just didn't know that this reading was classed as prediabetic, and wanted to know what other people think.",
joely,
i have searched the title but found no information on this doctor's seemingly promising methods for reducing blood sugar levels which concentrates on insulin growth factor (igf) or hormone development of the liver.,
.,
he states that the liver is encouraged through dietary methods to produce an alternative to insulin - a growth hormone thus reducing the load on the pancreas especially in the case of type 2.,
"he goes on to say that this hormone is fostered to such an extent that, if i understand him correctly, markedly assists type 1 which has astonished patients' doctors, etc., etc.",
"@indy51 yes, that is why i am asking the question here.",
the present attempt to scam us (if it is indeed a scam) has been carried by the daily mail newspaper (london) in the form of a video for quite a long while now - surely that medium would have received some complaints by now?,
no reference to a book is made nor to long monthly commitments or ongoing payments.,
it uses the english language perfectly and majors on the consumption of mixtures of various foods which are revealed upon a refundable payment of $37.,
i obviously realize that this may be a scam and only ask members if they know anything to the detriment of this dr. pearson and his treatise.,

i think that's why it felt weird throwing it in the bin.,
"they keep telling everyone not to throw medicines with household waste, and since insulin is a medicine i somehow made that connection... paul-1976 said: not what i was told!",
i was told that when my pen was either getting too low/or it had been kept at room temprature for more than the recommended amount of time that we should always attach a needle and keep dialling the pen and extruding the pens contents down the sink or toilet until you could no longer dial the pen and all the insulin had been spent and then and only then should we put it in the household waste-minus the needle of course.,

hi peripheral neuropathy in my feet.,
mainly underneath toes which feel numb but very tender/sore.,
have collected some suitable shoes and some protectit socks on order.,
looking for some suggestions on gel insoles that will help cushion under the feet and specifically the toes.,
toes are ridiculously tender i am hoping gel insoles will help but unsure which ones are best.,
appreciate any advice thanks,
"evening, hope everyone's well with another storm firing it's way up over here..",
"but i wanted to ask, see if anyone knows, about sugar in tea and how it can affect bs levels.",
"i've gone from 2 sugars in tea 3-4 years ago down to just less than 1/4 of a teaspoon, i have around 5-8 small sized cups per day, it's only tea and sparkling water that i drink, no coffee or alcohol etc.",
"i used to have a scone with butter and jam with each cup that's gone too, it's just tea with less than 1/4 teaspoon of sugar and a digestive biscuit.",
"i've cut down on all sugars, all pasties, dropped down to a small cup and less than 1/4 spoon of sugar in my tea.",
i see this as a reward.,
"what i'd like to know, if anyone could help please, is; will a drink prepared this way with a biscuit be a wrong assumption that it's ok to have.",
"i have told myself if i've made the trip down from 2 to 1/4 teaspoon i could drop down to no sugar, i've tried it and all that happens is i drink less tea.",
"not into green, camomile teas etc just a good quality english breakfast tea with a drop of milk.",

what do you do with your drink of tea?,

"sent from the diabetes forum app rden66 said: hi q007, when i was diagnosed back in september 13 i too loved my sweet things.",

it seems that many many people are found to be prediabetic or actually have diabetes when they go to their doctors for something else.,
were you diagnosed this way and it came as a total shock because you had no idea you had it.,
do you think diabetes should have more publicity to make people more aware of it it is very worrying to think of the number of people who perhaps have not seen a doctor for a very long time but may have diabetes and the health profession think there are hundreds.,
tv run health warnings about the symptoms of cancer so should they also do the same for diabetes mo1905 said: diabetes charities are very poor relations to cancer and heart disease etc.,
public awareness is very poor because if this.,
"most media have us down as fat, lazy people which also doesn't help.",

sent from the diabetes forum app click to expand... you are right diabetes has this poor and totally wrong image as only affecting those who eat junk food don't excercise and so become obese.,
"people do not seem to be aware that it can affect anyone whatever their lifestyle so should never dismiss it as not ever happening to them i was diagnosed 20 years ago in my 30s when i had a blister on my foot which wouldn't heal, i had some suspicions about diabetes and asked to be tested but was told they wouldn't / couldn't while i had an infection - a few weeks later i had the gp sat on the end of my bed saying ""i've messed up"" because he'd eventually tested my bm which was 28 h i was admitted to hospital with blood sugars in the 30s and put straight onto an insulin pump.",
i nearly lost my leg because it was so infected and spent the next 5 months in hospital recovering from surgery to my foot and a myriad of hospital acquired infections- unsurprisingly i'm not with the same gp practice i had been tested numerous times from the age of about 7 but only by urine tests that came back negative.,
i was deventually dagnosed as t2 but they treckoned i'd been diabetic for at least 15 - 20 years pre dianosis,

hello :wave: i am having a great deal of trouble trying to get my blood glucose to stabilise.,
gliclazide seems to make me feel very ill but my doctor wants me to take it.,
she's recently given me a bg monitoring thingy which i've found very useful.,
with 2 metformin twice a day my readings over two days are like this: 8 - 6.7 - 9.1 - 8.5 - 7.1 - 7.7.,
7.8 - 9.2 with gliclazide - 1/2 tablet taken twice a day over two days i get this: 11.3 - 10.8 - 4.7 - 11.6 - 15.2 - 6.3 -5.9 -6.8 - 9.1 - 13.7 - 10.6 - 7.1 with gliclazide my bg seems all over the place and one minute i feel very cold then i feel warm and shaky then cold and achey and weak.,
when i was first diagnosed nearly 3 months ago my bg was 24 so it's come down quite a lot but i was shocked to see it at 15.2 with a ketone warning yesterday.,
any help or advice would be gratefully received please.,
"hi xyzzy and thank you for replying, this is an example of what happened yesterday: before breakfast = 9.1 after breakfast (porridge) with 2 metformin and 1/2 gliclazide = 13.7 before lunch = 10.6 after lunch (plate of veg only - sprouts, brocolli, cauli, asparagus with some mint sauce and a bit gravy) = 7.1 before tea = 8.1 after tea (7 strawberries with a piece of brie) with 2 metformin and 1/2 gliclazide = 6.0 bedtime (very hungry, had 2 digestives with peanut butter) = 6.3 basically i am afraid to eat anything and i decided to eat very little yesterday to see what happened with my bg.",
from lunchtime onwards yesterday after eating just veg and then strawberries for tea i felt very cold and weak and achey.,
this morning: before breakfast = 10.6 after breakfast (porridge) 16.0 with ketone warning - 2 metformin (didn't take gliclazide) before lunch (bag of french fries and half can of semolina) 14.0 (took the half gliclazide) i only seem to feel ok once a day and that's when i have porridge for breakfast...from lunchtime onwards it's a downhill slippery slope to feeling ****.,
maybe i should just eat porridge 3 times a day and nothing else?,
i just don't know how i should be trying to control this horrible condition - i feel so demoralised because even when i take the medication and try to eat sensibly my bg is all over the place with ketone warnings.,
"when i was diagnosed 3 months ago with a bg level of 24, the doctor did a ketone test and it came back clear...so now it seems that with medication and sensible eating i'm still getting the ketone warnings.",
"darn it, that's bad news that it could be the porridge that's causing problems.",
it's the only meal of the day i like.,
i do eat meat but i've really lost my appetite lately - maybe it's just a mental block thing cos of not knowing what to eat.,
when i say i had a bag of french fries i meant the walkers crisps things rather than a bag of greasy chips.,
"i just seem to have got it into my head that the glic is making me feel ill, which is why i didn't take it with breakfast.",
i'd had a rough two days so tried to do without it.,
"when my doctor gave me the bg monitoring machine she told me to ring the surgery if my bg went over 10 and i knew that if i phoned her she'd just tell me to take the glic anyway, so i did - besides it's sunday and she wouldn't have been there anyway.",
one glic tablet seems to be too much in one go which is why i'm just taking half.,
"so, anyway, i took the glic late morning and had a terrible bout of the runs and my bg went right down to 7 then 6 then 4 and i started feeling very shaky so i ate a toffee and it shot back up to 11.",
i don't know whether it's ok to take another half a glic this late in the day in case i have a hypo when i'm asleep so now i'm fretting about that!,
i suppose my bg level will be very high again in the morning.,
i'm also testing so much that i'm finding it difficult to find places to get blood - my fingers are sore and the blood hardly comes out and now i'm wasting the testing strips/lancets cos of getting error messages.,
basically whenever i feel different i test because i really want to learn what my bg levels are when i feel odd at various times of the day so that eventually i'll know what's wrong with my bg without needing to test - hopefully!,
once my bg levels rise then the nerve pain kicks in too which keeps me awake.,
bonus.,
":crazy: anyway, thank you for your comments, i will take the time to read them again tomorrow and see what changes i can make.",
clearly i need to think a bit more about what i'm eating.,
i do feel exhausted and very tearful with it all but i guess you've all been through it.,
thank you so much for all your comments which i am taking on board.,
"i did take a quarter of a glic before bed last night and woke up with a 9.3 reading which was better than the last test which was 11.4 - usually i wake up with a reading that is higher than my last test, but this time it was lower.",
"i think it's finally sunk in too, thanks to jopar, that i have to get my morning bg under better control so i did take a whole glic this morning an hour before breakfast.",
i then tested again before breakfast and my bg had lowered slightly.,
i will find it very difficult to give up porridge so i had a smaller portion this morning and will see what effect that has when i test again in an hour or so.,
if it's still not good then i will give it up and try something else.,
it's only been since i had this blood monitoring machine that i've been able to see what's going on and can now try to do something about it.,
"my doctor told me to test just once a day, in the morning, but i don't think that's enough at the moment.",
i needed to see for myself what was happening especially the effects of what i am eating - which has clearly not been good enough.,
finally i think things are starting to sink in and realise that it's not the tablets that are making me ill but what i eat when i take them.,
the variation in breakfast alone has now given me a reading of 7.5 two hours after breakfast whereas normally i'd be looking at 10-16 with a ketone warning.,
that is the best post-breakfast reading i've had so far!,
"you have all given me some very good advice and spelled it out, which is just what i needed, because i honestly didn't realise what was happening to me nor how to make things better but now i feel that things are starting to sink in and i can try to take control rather than thinking it would be the drugs that did the work...or made me feel so ill.",
thank you very much :thumbup: i can't believe the difference today just by having a smaller portion of porridge!,
"9.3 bg on waking followed by 8.8 after i'd taken a whole gliclazide, then 7.5 after breakfast followed by 4.1 before lunch (which was a salad with a boiled egg and a bit of cottage cheese and a banana) then 5.2 after lunch.",
i felt quite shaky when it was at 4.1 which is my lowest ever reading and why i had the banana.,
"it was then 8.6 before tea and before taking the second lot of metformin, so i'll check it again in a couple of hours to see what it's like then.",
"pretty good readings today, but i still have to get it down to under 7, is that right?",
the best bit is that i haven't felt cold all day and not nearly so achey and weak either.,
"sometimes i get so weak that i can barely stand and walk, but today has been much better.",
and that is because of having porridge for breakfast?,
blimey!,
:shock: i've been making the porridge with half each of skimmed milk and low fat milk.,
"if i had to make it with just water :thumbdown: i would be able to give it up no probs - having said that, with the brilliant results i've had today, then i think i will just have porridge a couple of times a week rather than every day and try something else other days.",
as i said earlier my bg level was 8.6 before tea and it was 6.5 two hours later.,
i find it incredible that it actually went down rather than up!,
and all because i started the day properly it's had a knock-on effect all day.,
"the only reason i had the small banana was because i was feeling shaky and my bg was down to 4.1, which is the lowest it's ever been since being diagnosed.",
there are a few things that i'm still unclear about.,
what is the difference between a non-diabetic being able to eat porridge and a diabetic not being able to eat it?,
what is the difference between being non-diabetic and being diabetic?,
what is it about carbs that makes the bg level rise?,
maybe if i understood it all a bit better then it would make life a bit easier.,
what does the glic do that makes me need to be wary of it?,
maybe i should go back to just half tomorrow and see what happens?,
i did go a bit low today (for me) but apparently 4.1 is still within a good range and i probably didn't need the banana - but i was just about to go out in the car and the doctor said i should always test before driving and not to drive if my bg was under 5.,
what does the metformin do?,
have just done my final test for today (4 hours after tea) and it's gone up a bit to 7.5.,

yes will do.. have just viewed the lecture by dr jason fang on youtube: his evidence for a lchf diet is extremely convincing.,
seems amazing that current medical orthodoxy and practice is not following up on this study.,
"daphne917 said: @richardofyork my hba1c was 48 on diagnosis and i was prescribed statins "" because all diabetics should take them"" and my hba1c rose to 54.",
after i came off statins due to other side effects my hba1c decreased to 36 which indicates to me that there is a link.,

many thanks to everyone who responded.,
i think you are right.,
there is also reputable medical research that backs this up.,
researchers in finland found that statins were associated with an almost 50% higher risk of developing t2d - even after adjusting the results for all other factors.,
statins increase insulin resistance.,
i no longer take statins.,

from time to time i develop a skin rash for want of a better description on my face.,
"i get red lines running out from the edges of my mouth to my chin (approximately mutton chops shape) and the skin along my chin becomes extremely sore, itchy, dry and flaky.",
this occurs quite suddenly.,
i moisturise heavily and it usually goes away within a week or two.,
see attached photos.,
"the first time it happened, i had just returned from 2 weeks in africa during which i had excellent blood sugar control and put it down to the doxycycline anti-malaria tablets.",
this recurred last week.,
i had experienced very good blood sugar control for over a month since i had been working and very active.,
"at a party in my honour i had a jam doughnut and other sweet stuff, which of course i know i should not have eaten.",
it flared up almost immediately.,
my current theory now is that it is diabetes related and occurs if i have a sudden increase in blood sugars after a period of good control.,
i would be interested if anyone else has had a similar experience and any tried and tested treatments.,
"of course - if my theory is correct, i know how to avoid recurrence.",

"despite having been diabetic for 10 years before this happened for the first time, the first occurrence was after returning from africa to a roasting summer here.",
i know that doxycycline can trigger skin rashes so it assumed that it was the cause - perhaps it did trigger it.,
every other occurrence has been in the summer so this is the first time that it has happened in the winter.,
that is what made me think that diabetes may have been the cause.,
my fbg at 6:15 was 9.2 this morning and i started the day with a coffee and 30ml double cream.,
tested again at 10:15 before eating 300g broccoli and 30g butter.,
i boiled the broccoli in plain water and added no seasoning.,
level at this point was 9.7 so it had gone up despite the coffee and cream.,
when i tested again at 12:10 it was 11.7!,
i was shocked.,
washed hands again and retested using another finger and 11.5.,
should i put broccoli on my list of food to avoid?,
"freema said: how many calories do you eat in a day in total... if you eat very very little, the liver in some cases take over and produce glucose instead of eaten glucose from ones eaten proteins..not only in the dawn phenomenon.",
if one do not eat enough the body can sometimes break down protein from ones tissue and muscles instead... so if you are on a like 700 calorie diet in total that can maybe be happening... it doent happen to all people but some with servere anorexia or on extreme low banting calorie levels can experience that.,
but maybe you are not at all in that league then look away from this comment right away... but the lower the better is not always a fact could also be excess protein from yesterday being transformed into glucose.,

i normally wake with perfect levels (between 4-6) and start work at 8am 'prior' to having insulin/breakfast at 9.30am.,
my problem is that 'before' i do my pre breakfast injection my blood will already have risen from anywhere between 8-10.,
as a result my mid morning levels remain high (sometimes peaking at 16) prior to dropping to normal around mid-day.,
i use novorapid and inject 20/30 mins before eating!,
my observations/theories are as follows but any help would be most useful?,
:- 1) i've heard of liver dumps but can't accept this happens the same 'most' days?,
2) could 'stress' in first 1.5 hours at work be the cause.....if so i think i will quit work!!??,
3) i use currently use 33units levimir at night.....does anyone believe changing to lantus may help?,
4) could eating nearer to injection time possibly help?,
"5) does insulin 'generally' absorb slower in the body at mornings rather than other periods of the day for information i inject 10 units of novorapid and only comsume 1no toast, poached egg and very small glass of natural orange juise so i cannot really accopt that i need to increase morning insulin?",
thankyou all for your comments 1)i think i will try splitting my levimer which i have never done before.,
as i use pre-filled cartridges i will need to inject twice as i cannot mix....assume this is ok?,
"2) carbsrok i take your point about ""not sussing out my insulin"" however i am not new to diabetes and have been type 1 for over 20 yrs (i am 37now).",
my ratios have worked for a long time but i am finding it more challenging by the year and my insulin needs are increasing slightly....has anyone had experiances or cause to appreciate that this is normal?,
3) i have always postponed eating for a longer while after injecting if bg are high before a meal as it seems natural to let insulin absorb to bring levels down....has anyone had personal experiance to suggest otherwise that it is better to inject novorapid directly before eating as opposed to waiting 30mins....appreciate i will need to experiment on this one!!,
"hi ebony 321 i don't think sarcasm is meant, maybe poiniant but constructive none the less......after all he is like your good self giving advice from experiance which is generally valuable.",
"personally i have been drinking fresh unsweetened orange juice or similar and incorporate into my daily allowance and have done for the past 22 years without a problem, but we all differ.",
carbsrok i have never split levimir into 2 doses and my query was not the amount rather the fact i use flex pens which cannot be mixed so i would inject twice in morning....once using novorapid and once with levimir....i was assuming that this is ok and that they didn't have to be mixed as i have seen before?,
as for basal testing i have not heard this before so any advice is welcome?,
my tests throughout the day are good it is just the mid morning as previously noted that i am currently experiancing problems carbsrok could you give me a brief summary of carbs you consume in a basic day?,
"i am intrigued to hear your comment to suggest that your 'daily' intake of novorapid is approx 10?.....i can only asssume that you are on a very low carb diet, which of course has it's benefits but an indication of you carb intake may prove helpful?",
also how much levimir do you take?,
carbsroc a different insulin to mine and great if it works for you thanks for your posts help needed on liver dumps!?,
we have had some computer gremlins this morning and part of this post was lost.,
the question was about liver dump's.,
cugila forum monitor 1) do they tend to occur at similar times of the day for the individual in question?,
no.,
they can occur at any time day or night.,
"it is just a biological process, prompted by low blood sugar levels.",
"in the early hours it is termed dawn phenomenon, later on it is known as a liver dump.",
"exactly the same process, increasing your bg levels.",
2) can anything be done to reduce or avoid them?,
tight control of bg levels will help.,
"if levels drop too far during the night then it kicks in, raisng the bg levels.",
"now if the person doesn't eat straight away after waking then that can trigger a liver dump, not enough insulin pre meals and maybe not enough carbs can also trigger it.",
3) can stress/tension cause onset stress and tension usually causes bg levels to rise which would negate the need for a liver dump.,
same as when ill. 4) does anything (such as alchohol) cause onset (as associated with liver)?,
alcohol can lower the bg levels so may have some effect.,
5) are they generally 'common' with diabetes......or rare?,
"anybody, even non-diabetic's can liver dump.",
it is a natural biological process.,
the body's own defence mechanism coming to the rescue !,
6) is there any way to confirm if i am experiancing liver dumps or not?,
testing.,
"fasting, waking, pre and post meals and throughout the day.",
comparing the reults.,
seeing how you actually feel.,
"there is also the little matter of the somogyi effect, which you might like to read up on ?",
"it is discussed on the forum somewhere, if you do a search.",
get's very complicated.,
:wink: cugila slight hiccup here....had to answer in your post.,
trying to get it sorted.......,
hi all i have a question for you guys and it might sound silly but do any of you have eye floaters(the squiggly lines or dots in your sight).,
a year ago when i was first diagnosed i had my eye screening and they told me i had very early changes in my eyes and it scared the hell out of me and still frightens me now.,
i spoke to the opticians who couldnt find anything and even told me i have healthy eyes and not to worry even my nurse tells me not to worry and its a pretty standard letter that most diabetics get.,
"now my problem is when i walk into a bright room i can see a few floaters that shoot around my eyesight, its possible that iv had these for years but have been reading too much about retinopathy on the internet and just worrying myself.",
what do u guys think and is it common?,
thanks everyone i do have another yearly eye exam coming up in october but i might see if i can bring it forward i just hope my eyes dont fall out before then haha amansingh said: i am being treated for diabetic retinopathy and the description you made in the post above does not sound like 'floaters' rather it sounds like leaking (bleeding) blood vessels in the retina which need treatment as if left they can cause serious complications.,
"i am not a doctor but after more than one year of eye injections, laser photo coagulation and now awaiting vitrectomy i strongly suggest you get them checked out with a good opthalmologist who specialises in diabetic retinopathy.",
early treatment will save your sight.,
click to expand... hi is your reply in regards to me or lazybones.,
as you have retinopathy can you tell me do you have lots of floaters and how would you describe yours,
are there any type 1 women out there who have had babies or miscarridges?,
i would be very interested to hear how it all went and exchange advice/information/ personnal experiences about this.,
don't know anyone else who has.,
lots of information for gestational diabetics but not type 1's.,
anyone out there?,
well i'm having a rubbish time diabetes wise; i have a child already (healthy and fine) and have since then lost two babies.,
it seems letting my blood sugers get too low/keeping them perfect so i am liable to hypo with the slightest physical exercion is causing me problems eg: foetal anomalies and miscarridges.,
"when i eat eveything in sight and let my sugers get quite high from time to time but never go too low (as i did with my 1st born and am doing now (i'm pregnant again and a scan has shown theres no anomalies), it seems to work.",
"i have had a lot of pressure from the medical establishment to try new insulins and keep my blood sugers too low (perfect/borderline hypo), but after two deaths i'm going on what i have worked out myself from experience and how i feel physically within myself.",
", i pretty much eat what i want; but no sugery drinks (all diet and no added sugar), no sweets unless i'm hypoing or having a very light meal and want a 'top up' to keep up my blood sugers, i'll have the ocassional bit of chocolate though.",
"mabe a sweet desset following a light or smaller portioned meal and plenty of snacks; eg; cheese, crackers, crisps and fruit and even a few biscuits.",
this way seems to be serving me just fine although i'm aware of the long term effects (but theres always laser eye surgery and we can't all live until we are 100!).,
"i don't think a pump would suit me or help at all; i would love a pancreas transplant but i couldn't stand all the fuss and check ups since its in its early piloting stages and its not worth it for me considering the side effects of the drugs used to stop your body rejecting the transplant, suppressing an already not 100% immune system- maybe one day when the tech and drugs are more developed.",
but if you get a pump please let me know how it goes......,
hi.,
just have this feeling that men seem to be reluctant to post and ask questions on sexual problems and advice/solutions.,
i myself have had erectile problems and low testosterone levels due to diabetes.,
i reckon this is a very under reported issue on dcuk and maybe it's because females are more likely to feel comfortable talking about this (i could be wrong - it's all perception).,
i've been on this forum for two years now and it's just something i thought about and i know it can cause a lot of serious problems for men.,
anybody agree or disagree ?,
i just want to test the waters.,
thanks edward.,
i experienced an unusual phenomenon at 44 which was i totally lost interest in sex and women very suddenly and persisted for a long time.,
it even contributed to a break up of a relationship.,
i also had problems getting/maintaining an erection and couldn't achieve an orgasm.,
i was tried on sildafenil but didn't do much and was referred to a consultant urologist.,
i had two first thing in the morning blood tests to check my testosterone levels which turned out to be extremely low.,
i was started on tostran 2% testosterone gel (can only be prescribed by a consultant) and used it for 3 years and my levels returned to normal and all my sexual dysfunction disappeared.,
"turned out to be a very easy fix but took ages for me to even mention it to my gp, felt like a confessional but he treated me like a man and was really good and supportive.",
my urologist said it is common in diabetics.,
well i can now get back to saturday night fever antics lol.,
"maybe us men are less educated too, roughly similar numbers of prostate cancer vs breast cancer diagnoses each year but women are way more likely to recognise symptoms and see a doctor.",
it's so unnecessarily.,
hello!,
"i have been type 2 now for about 8 years, with generally good control.",
ive lost about four stone over that time (slow and steady!),
and am now following slimming world to try and lose some more.,
im still hovering around 17stone though.,
over the last year i seem to have lost control though.,
as it is has been gradual the gp and dn feel this is due to my pancreas becoming less efficient.,
"so, even though the metformin increased to 4 x 500mg tablets a day, i still ended up with a hba1c of 9.1 (sorry, still work in old money).",
so they have put me onto 10mg of dapagliflozin a day too.,
"now, ive only been on this for a week, but boy am i struggling with this.",
i can handle the peeing but i now have thrush in my throat and on the nether region.,
lower back pain too.,
they tell me my kidneys are fine (so is my liver and cholesterol).,
i am prone to thrush though anyway.,
dont much like the dry mouth either.,
"ive read a bit about this new ""wonder drug.""",
"most people seem to say its the bees knees on open forums, but i dont trust their independence (call me a sceptic).",
has anyone here got experience of this drug?,
how long did the side effects last?,
did it help?,
i have not felt this lousy in years and am sick and tired of being sick and tired.,
thanks thank you catherinecherub.,
i have picked up some thrush meds from the doctor and will persevere for a bit longer.,
just looking to see how long it takes to settle down.,
thanks chocoholicnomore.,
i've not seen a reduction in my blood sugar yet but it might be an accumulative effect.,
it's wearing me down really and i'm worried the next step is insulin.,
"hi everyone, thanks for your posts.",
"it does seem to bring down the blood sugars by making you pee it out, causing thrush.",
i've got one or two other things going on since being on it but they seem to be settling down.,
i've also lost some weight but that might also be due to my diet (slimming world).,
i have found your comments helpful but so far no one seems sold out out on this drug has anyone had a totally positive experience with it?,
"really appreciate all the responses though - i'm not alone anymore sorry for the silence, been busy.",
today my gp took me off this drug as i am not tolerating the side effects well.,
the constant thrush is a pain but i've had episodes of low bp due to reduced blood volumes.,
"made me feel terrible really, sluggish and tired.",
so after a few days break to get it out of the system he's trying anagliptin.,
hope this does the trick although not filled with confidence.,
basically anytime start to talk about diabetes it leads to arguments which leads to an increase in blood levels.....stressed.,
any feedback would be appreciated.,
thanks guys for the input much appreciated.,
has given me food for thought and didn't think about 'fear'.,
i'm quite fiery in response and so probably don't put my brain in gear before i open my gob!,
my partner is 'prediabetes' and didn't stop to think of the 'fear factor'.,
good to see another angle.,
does anyone know of something to cover the foot to keep it dry for swimming.,
the only medical things i can find look like giant carrier bags and would be a ridiculous sight on the beach!!,

"hi all i went to buy some inositol as i read on the internet that it is good for reducing blood sugars and is sometimes an alternative to metformin, the advisor in the shop said i need to query it with my doctor to see if they can be used together, does anyone use inositol, apparent you can buy inositol and choline which has the added benefit of reducing fat from the liver which i would really like to try, does anyone have any experience of this, also i have thinking of taking magnesium supplements as i crave chocolate a lot which can be a sign of magnesium deficiency especially amongst diabetics, any help please as i am so confused :?",

so today i was testing my blood...put in my carbs etc and pressed onli and then it came up with e57 electronic error and to remove the batteries and replace in 20 seconds...i did that and tried turning it on and all it did was make a faint sound!,
i left it for a bit and tried again and it did the same!,
"so i went on a massive hunt in work for some batteries i luckily found some and after two tries it was back on and all okay so far, have let accu-chek know but has anyone else had this???",

they was new ones lol!,

you don't want to mess around.,
easier for them to send you another one and factory reset yours click to expand... yeah should be at my work tomorrow morning luckily!,
and then got to send the other one back!!,
but this means i have got to write all my settings down tonight... oh the fun haha!,
"x jaylee said: hi, this is just a thought..",
though i'm not familiar with this particular model.,
it could actually be the battery connection causing a power distribution problem throwing up the error..?,
has the unit had a knock or bump recently.?,
i agree about a replacement unit.!,
click to expand... hahahahah i was waiting for you to comment lol don't know why just was ahaha!,
but erm could be??,
but why would it just be when i actually test the blood??,
any how new meter coming...alot of hard work to be done!,
gah!,
"erm not that i know of no, but there is a slight scratch or crack on my screen in the corner...not that big but god knows where that has come from :s x jaylee said: it could be cutting out when you test the blood due to the movement of the unit?",
if the battery shifts on a loose or dirty connection this may cut the power or give the impression to the electrickery of low power..?,
thus the error.,
"""scratch or crack"" could be trauma to the integrity of the battery compartment??",
i suggest you always keep a written note of you settings..,

"i've seen lots of graphs showing 'normal' response to meals etc., but just wondering how much variation in bg a non-diabetic person would see throughout a 24 hour period.",
"for example: does the bg level run lower throughout the night and by how much what happens during the 'waking up' and getting moving period what happens during various levels of exercise (any change going for a walk vs major session in gym) how much change would be seen with 'stress' (eg during a major presentation or even just a busy period) i suspect this would vary a lot between people, but does anyone have any examples ?",
thanks for all your responses.,
@cherryaa your friend does indeed keep very level throughout the 24 hours apart from the sugar spike.,
i'm also really interested in your graph @kokhongw .,
looks like you go lower overnight and also quite a dip at 7pm prior to dinner.,
would that be caused by exercise maybe ?,

a short while ago early morning tv had a lady talking about diabetes and a picture of an appropriate breakfast came up as 2 weetabix and a banana.,

honey is extremely high in sugar.,

hi all of you thank you so much for the lovely welcome and advice.,
what a shock to find everyone's different so its about measuring levels which of course hasn't been talked about yet by my nurse because the diagnosis at present has moved to pre/borderline diabetes and till i came on here didn't even get that they meant the same thing!,
"@azure @brunneria @tim2000s , i would be interested to hear your thoughts on an observation of increased insulin resistance with a very low carb/keto diet.",
"i was discussing this topic recently with somebody with t1d (we tried a food fast together over a number of days) they noticed that coming back out of the fast, their insulin requirements had increased fairly significantly in order to manage any carb they ate (the increased requirements only lasted a few days).",
"interestingly, their basal had remained exactly the same throughout the fast however and blood glucose levels had remained level.",
this would suggest that their 'insulin resistance' hadn't actually changed at all.,
"what we considered had perhaps happened was that the body had become so effective at burning ketones and generating its own glucose requirements (gluconeogenesis), that once carbs were re-introduced, the body was fairly 'ambivalent' to it - after all, it had everything it needed to fuel itself perfectly well up until that point.",
"without cells calling out for a top up of glucose, more insulin would be required in order to be effective at taking the glucose out of the bloodstream.",
this was a temporary effect and therefore perhaps different to insulin resistance created through the build up of fat deposits.,
"anyway, i thought i would relay this to you (and anyone who might have their own experience to add).",
"perhaps it is misleading to think of the body's adaptation to a low carb diet as becoming 'insulin resistant' and it might be better instead to think of it becoming 'fat complient' thanks for that @tim2000s azure said: it's referred to as physiological insulin resistance and correctly so, in my opinion @bebo321 we were discussing this on a recent thread so when i get the chance, i'll put links in for you and other readers http://freetheanimal.com/2014/10/physiological-resistance-carbohydrate.html http://www.marksdailyapple.com/does-eating-low-carb-cause-insulin-resistance/#comment-3087940 .",
"(read the comment and then scroll to the top of the page for the article) info about the effect of fat: http://www.joslin.org/dietary-fat-can-affect-insulin-requirements-in-type-1-diabetes.html so, to answer your question, i believe it is insulin resistance - just with a specific cause.",
"it's good that the body can run on ketones when needed, but it's not something i'd be wanting to happen full time - not as a type 1 and not if i didn't have any type of diabetes at all.",
click to expand...,
thank you @azure thank you for all of your input - it's fascinating stuff!,
i think my confusion is rooted in the definition of exactly what insulin resistance is.,
if you would please bear with me....,
version 1.,
"to my basic understanding (and i bow to your greater knowledge on this) it has to do with a 'faulty' signalling pathway for the glut4 receptors, meaning that they no longer translocate effectively through insulin stimulation.",
(interestingly this process of translocation is maintained perfectly well in the case of muscle contraction which is why exercise is so useful as a means of managing bgs).,
"i understood that this diminishing sensitivity to insulin takes a long time to develop (months certainly, more likely years) and was linked to excessive fat deposits throughout the body - most particularly liver and muscles.",
i considered that this was what was commonly being referred to as the insulin resistance connected with the development of type 2 diabetes.,
version 2.,
"during a period of low carbing where the body becomes keto adapted, i think there is every possibility that 'carb resistance' becomes a factor (described very beautifully @brunneria with the pancreas's 'holiday from carbs'.",
"the other thing you mention @tim2000s is in relation to glut4s and another thought occurs to me - bearing in mind that glut4s are able to proliferate in number remarkably quickly through exercise, i wonder if it isn't just that the opposite happens when we stop eating carbs - glut4 receptor numbers diminish.",
perhaps it would take two or three carb meals for numbers to bump back up again where they would normally be on a 'standard' diet.,
both pancreas holiday and lower glut4 numbers would explain a period of apparent insulin resistance after a period of low carbing.,
version 3.,
this relates to the liver and its habit of releasing glucose in response to cortisol.,
"theoretically if the liver is churning out glucose first thing in the morning (or if somebody suffers with chronically high stress levels), then even with reasonable insulin sensitivity, with the best will in the world elevated blood glucose levels may be the result.",
the 'faulty' cortisol/glucagon signalling - is this effectively 'insulin resistance'?,
"take a finger prick test and it would appear so, but it has a completely different meaning.",
version 4.,
this one relates to eating (and thank you @azure for your links).,
the joslin item is of interest in relation to this as it relates to the insulin resistance induced though consuming fat in combination with carb (i appreciate the joslin trial included protein too).,
i found one bit of research where triglycerides were infused into the bloodstream of an athlete during digestion and there was a marked reduction in insulin sensitivity.,
"i have to say, this is the version of 'insulin resistance' that has me stumped as to the scientific explanation (or just a logical hypothesis) and would be interested to hear your thoughts.",
i think i understand what you mean by you description of 'physiological insulin resistance' @brunnaria - thank you.,
"otherwise, is there anything i've missed or misunderstood regarding what we might refer to everyday insulin resistance?",
"(oh, sorry, the fast was over five days, followed by two days low carb 500 calories per day - i chickened out after four days )",
"my nurse put me on metformin about a year ago but two weeks ago added gliclazide,i am quite over weight and been trying to lose it ,managed to lose just over a stone since christmas but gained 3lb in last few weeks and i'm now low carbing,i've read these tablets are weight gainers is there another tablet i could ask for cause gaining weight is the last thing i need.the nurse is always on my back about losing weight and now i am she gives me these tablets :roll: shan x hi dennis,nurse put me on the gliclazide because when she got my blood test back she said my blood sugar was sky high,but she told me i must eat carbs every meal like jacket spuds ,sandwiches,and such like she would hit the roof if i told her i am low carbing.i only started to test my own bloods from sunday this week and it's read mostly 14.5 but tonight after a couple of hours after my tea i was 7.3 so i was pleased but i only have one test strip left and my nurse won't give me a meter i bought my own so i can't test again from tomorrow.so i think low carbing may of started to help but why don't the gp's and d.nurses see this, :?",

what should i do?,

"the letter was a standard one, not just to me.",
i am wondering if this is nationwide or just my locality?,
"have blood tests for some reason changed, so that they no longer have to be fasting ones?",
"what are your experiences, and does anyone know why.",
"hi please read this and if you an connect to it then please reply and please dnt judge me, the past 6 months i have noticed my eyes are starting to hurt and strain abit.",
"i am very hard working and up at the crack of dawn everyday and find i get bad head aches aswell thru the pain in my eyes , how ever i have noticed when i smoke cannabis there is no strain on my eyes what do ever ?",
"but when i dnt smoke theirs pain, i went thru a patch of not smoking but the pain was just there 24 / 7 then once i started again it was gone ???",
"i was a regular cannabis smoker before being diagnosed and i still am now, i deffinetly feel cannabis helps my eye pain, also it builds up a really good appetite for me and i eat properly and my sugar levels are now pretty good cause of this .",

answer none !,
alcohol ?,

any way back to the origanial question if u can relate to it please reply thanks .,
"i dnt drink alcohol at all by the way thanks for ur reply , can i just ask what's iop also i've never heard some one say eye pressure , ?",
is this something i need to book thru my doctor ?,
i have regular eye tests and the last one my eye sight was 20/20 but my eyes are just painfull so is that a bad thing reducing my iop ?,
"thanks for that very useful, so i'm not 100% but reducing my iop by smoking cannabis is why i feel less strain on my eyes ??",
"i'm due a eye test in 3 weeks , and have a doctors appointment in 2 so will speak to my doctor about it then .",
surely i can't be the only one lol,
i keep craveing food like cake and high sugery foods?,
"like i had some honey today and it tasted soo good i dont know what to do thanks guys,thanks for the cake recipe i will try that like tonigh i had 2 pancakes with honey on and some choclate and banna milkshake i went up to 18.7 or something but it went back down?",
so it cant be that bad if am eating sugary foods i know i have to go hospital if i reach 20. lol i think am probly the only teen on here :/ louiseb said: have you tryed eating low carb alternatives that will satisfy your sugar craving but not have as much as an impact on your bg.,
try a few pieces of very dark choclate like at least 75% cocoa.,
also have you looked at the low carb receipe section you make your own cake and adapt the receipe to make it alot lower carb.,
ill go find you a receipe i use for choclate cake click to expand... thanks the drink really helps instead of the real thing yeah i like cheese not the mature one though il try it thanks,
this morning i checked my bs levels (fasting) as usual and they were 2.7...i also have a blood ketones monitor that i test every other morning just to make sure that my ketone levels are normal.,
"now, this morning during my hypo i thought i would test my ketone levels and they were reading at 3.1!!!!",
"of course, i was very shocked as i am in hypo mode and not feeling particularly unwell, just the usual hypo symptoms, which i have now treated.",
i am so confused as i associate high ketone levels with having high bs levels.,
can anyone explain to me how this has happened.,
in my 10 years of having t1 i have never had high ketone levels like this before.,
should i be worried?,
what do i need to do?,
thanks for your help.,
m x thanks for your replies.,
the ketones did come down eventually.,
i am low carbing so i think this is probably the answer.,
"i don't take enough insulin at the moment to have high insulin in my system, although i have reduced my basal rates as i am having too many hypos at the moment!",
spiker - not sure where you got the ketone reading of 0.3 - this was never mentioned in my post.,
it was 3.1 that i posted.,
"also, no chance of mixing up the ketone meter reading and i only have ketones strips for that particular meter as my blood glucose meter is different and links straight up to my pump.",
thanks for your replies.,
"spiker said: @mrburden i think that info you posted is accurate, but not precisely relevant to the op and other questions.",
"for the op, that level of ketosis (3.1) is just normal for low carbing.",
we don't need to suspect a hyperglycaemic or hypoglycemic state when a low carber shows moderate ketones.,
click to expand...,
thanks spiker.,
i had my diabetic check at the hospital today and mentioned this to them.,
i also had a 2.7 blood ketone reading this morning.,
"i was advised that because i am eating such low carbs, that ketones is quite normal and nothing to worry about as my blood sugar levels are too low for dka status.",
thanks everyone for your input.,
it is an interesting subject.,
i certainly have learnt something new about ketones!,
something bizarre!,
i seem to be getting significantly different blood sugar results when i take blood from a finger on my right hand from when i take it from a finger on my left hand.,
the results on my left hand are always lower.,
"just a coincidence, or could this be that the blood from my left arm/hand is more oxygenated, as it is closer to my heart.",
it could also be that the bs meter is unreliable.,
it was one of the cheapest available on amazon.,
can anyone recommend a really good bs meter?,
"i also find it easier to take blood from the fingers on my left hand, as the blood erupts more easily and generously when i puncture a finger on my left hand, rather than my right.",
thanks everyone.,
i use the code free as well.,
they must be making a killing if everyone here uses them.,
they are the number 1 bs monitor on amazon as well.,
there was roughly a two point (2.0) difference between both hands.,
that's one hell of a margin for error.,
it can be the difference between having normal blood sugar or not.,
"the only other difference was that on the right hand i usually have to squeeze harder to get the blood out, on the left i don't.",
isn't interstitial fluid straw coloured?,
what i see looks like blood.,
robbity a 2.0 difference is quite significant though isn't it?,
"it can be the difference between good blood sugar and bad blood sugar readings, if you are on the margin.",
"hi, im fairly new to all this.",
have been diagnosed as type 2 for about 2 years.,
still don't really know what im doing.,
have just managed to get a monitor from my dsn as i can't seem to bring my hba1c down.,
after a few tests i have found my morning levels are higher than 2 hours after my evening meal.,
"also i have been having a problem with really vivid dreams, everynight its a different one, some are nightmares but mainly im waking up in the morning so tired.",
has anyone else experinced this?,
could it be to do with my sugar levels or my medication?,
"i take 1 x 850mg of metformin in the morning and with my evening meal, and 1 x 15mg pioglitazon in the morning.",
"hi robert, no i've not had those before.",
thank you for your replies.,
"after reading many other thread on here and after testing, i have decided to go low carb.",
i have done the atkins diet many years ago so know it should be a good way to lose weight too.,
"i have found my old atkins book, and ordered the new diabetes revolution along with the collins gem carb counter that alot of people seem to use.",
"so next week when i go food shopping, i should be all set and ready to go!",
"hi, im now on day 3 of atkins, feeling good.",
"my bg numbers have come way down, and are now within the guidelines.",
so pleased about that!,
also have ketones so must be on my way to losing weight.,
"got plenty to lose, so it's all good.",
just really happy and pleased with myself at the moment.,
"still having the vivid dream so far, will have to see how that goes.",
"thanks to everyone here for all the comments, suggestions and receipes that help everyone.",
im so glad i found this forum.,
"l x now on day 8 of atkins style diet, weighed myself last night, have lost about 7lbs, so really happy.",
"also my bg are so much better, most under 10 even after a meal!",
onwards and downwards!!!,
":lol: thats the sort of things my dreams have, they are always totally random, just very vivid.",
i still haven't managed to work out whats causing them.,
"i suppose it could be the metformin, but i still need the one i still take.",
well 18 months later i think i have figured out when i get vivid dreams.,
someone else was talking about sleep issues and that reminded me.,
i believe that when i am in ketosis my dreams and much more vivid.,
its strange but thats what seems to be happening.,
so losing weight but weird vivid dreams......i'll survive.,
now if only i could get those dreams to feature the likes of jason statham.....................,
my blood sugars have been slowly rising since january and stated having real illness with metformin which was changed to sr metformin.,
"but levels still slowly rising, and after seeing my nurse it was decided to stop the victoza and start forxiga with the sr metformin i have to admit that i have not felt better than i do at the moment for many years.",
"no lethergy, bright and happy, no nausea or other metformin related problems.",
in fact i feel terrific..,
"but although i have only been on the forxiga for a week, the sugars are still rising..",
"morning now up to 17.6 from 16.2, and midday up to 14.5 from 12.6.",
"i have lost 7.5lb in weight in the last week, but no effect on levels ..",
"i presume the forxiga is working as i am now entered in the olympics for peeing, and the weight loss, but any idea on how soon before i might see the levels improve ???",
"rarely see anyone about the diabetes, apart from the annual blood test.",
"usually i send in a letter with a printout from the meter, the nurse at the surgery then consults with the ""district diabetic nurse"" and i then get a call from the surgery to tell me there is a prescription waiting for me in reception.",
and what to do.,
"bs's still climbing slowly, now in the 18's first thing, drinking gallons, but the weeing is slowing down, and i have put back 2 of the 7lb i lost.",
should i have changed my diet for this.,
i dont understand why i had to stop the victoza.,
"been in the high teens now since before christmas, nothing seems to work, and begining to have the occasional feeling down about nothing working.",
"i would agree, but i dont have a diabetes team, i do talk to my practice nurse who admits they are not diabetes trained, and just pass things on to the district diabetes nurse who ever they are who will send a reply, and as it's not an emergency i have to see my own doctor who's next available appointment is 6-8 weeks away..",
"sorry to say, but on here and my own research are about the only places some of us can get help.",
"they have now stopped the forxiga as it was having no effect on the sugar levels, but i did lose some weight, and spent a lot of time emptying the bladder.",
"now been on bydureon for 6 weeks, and blood sugars now are down to the 8's which is a vast improvement on the 18-20's they were...",
"slight downside, i have put back some of the weight i lost, although today's weigh in showed it had started to drop again, so fingers crossed there.. latest problem to materialise is the loss of movement of the fingers of my left hand.",
"been for neurophysiology test, and it appears the nerves in my left arm have stopped sending signals to my left hand, so waiting to hear from the surgery as to what treatment may or may not be available... fun being diabetic isn't it",
i'm pre diabetic and on metformin.,
"i'm also on a hen do tonight (pub crawl) metformin says in the leaflet to avoid alcohol and normally i don't drink, so have never had to ask the question before.",
does that mean i should not take my evening tablet and enjoy the evening (although probably not tomorrow's hangover) or does that mean i'm not allowed to drink at all?,
how do you guys manage alcohol in social situations?,
thanks.,
that's what i went with in the end.,
i have found since turning 40 that small amounts of most things alcoholic give me an awful hangover so i just normally avoid it.,
"i seem to be generally okay with clear spirits, so stuck to malibu and diet coke (+1 single shot of something weird) and only had 5 or 6 all night.",
ended up bringing the hen home early as she was in a tangle (and some people are idiots and kept buying her shots.,
...grrr ).,
i always seem to end up being mum!,
i must try to remember to talk to her about it at my next appointment.,
i rarely drink anyway so it's never at the top of my list of questions.,
i didn't have much to drink but threw up on the way home anyway.,
... not sure why,
"went for the bloods doing on tuesday, had a call from the doc today stating something in the fbc has come back abnormal to they want to repeat the test in 6 weeks.",
"now i am a very optimistic person and usually dont worry about such things......'its nothing till they say its something', but as my vile betraying body seems intent on letting me down, i am a tad worried.",
"all you guys 'n' gals on here seem pretty clued up about other stuff that may be related to diabetes, can you shed any light on the possibilities?",
thanks in advance for any input could be underactive thyroid?,
just been reading up on that and i have a large number of the symptoms.,
think i might make an appointment with the gp and get some resolution to said problems (whether it is connected or not) i got a phone call.,
which obviously worried me......they could have just written and said make another appointment for blood test.,
especially as it is 6 weeks away.,
"i asked which aspect of the test was abnormal and she just said 'oh it'll be fine, i don't know, but dont worry'' i won't worry as such, i will spend a few days seeing what it could be, then turn up armed with some knowledge (doctors hate that hehe) got my full review next thursday so i shall fight for the info then, cos i can guarantee i wont be able to see a doc before then ah, thank you guys, feel reassured now.",
"wasn't panicking, just curious as to what else this silly body is up to!",
"have been dieting, low carbing, although the carbs have crept up this week, i am blaming hormones for that.",
i also have quite bad hayfever at the minute because the rape seed is up.,
so all in all lots of 'trivial' things it could be.,
i need to see my gp asap on another matter so might just ask whilst i am there been for my first review and asked about the fbc.,
apparently my red cells are low and my white are high.,
"could be resulting from low grade infection which i might not have even known about, but checking to make sure it isn't anything else.",
(which is what #yorksman said lol) now should i share my hba1c?,
in this thread or another?,
edit: shared in in my signature,
"hi, i am diabetic for 17+ years and i used use insulin + tablets.",
but...story took a great turn.....,
started ketogenic diet 1 month back and stopped all the medicines on the first day itself.,
on the first day fbs was 178 and now its around 110 to 130.,
my questions are 1.,
how long it takes to reach 83-90 range if i continue on keto diet?,
"2. am i going in the right direction with the readings i posted above for 1 month 3. for the past 2 weeks the readings are between 110 and 130 and not going below, any reasons do you see?.",
bulkbiker said: so within 1 month you are off all meds and seeing much lower sugars..,
i would recommend you just carry on.,
"my fbg's took about 6 months on low carb before they got down to ""normal"" levels but considering the progress you are making it looks like it may be sooner for you.",
that is completely amazing!,
very well done indeed i'm so glad it s working out so well for you.,

thank you for the reply and encouragement.,
kokhongw said: looks like your glucose levels are responding very well and going the right direction.,
fasting bs takes the longest time to normalize.,
"we do have to remember that it had taken us years, if not decades for the condition to progress to the point of diagnosis.",
"so even when given the right conditions, it would take some time to heal, reverse the damages and normalize.",

thank you for the reply.,
will maintain consistency and continue the journey rom35 said: 1.,
"with big simplification it depends on the function of liver, pancreas and mass of muscles.",
combination of these three elements together with insulin resistance is individual for each person.,
to repair liver and pancreas your main task is lost the fat - do the cardio - quick walk.,
to repair muscles is to let them to be bigger - weight lifting i started to stabilise my fbg after 3 month when i had lost 12kg of fat and were able to lift 60kg on bench press 2.,
yes - nice job 3.,
see the point 1.,
also what is your bg going to sleep evening before?,
"do you eat something just before bed, do you drink alcohol before bed?",
"you have to experiment, what combination works for you.",

thank you for the suggestions.,
"i do walk, but have not mandated it as a daily routine, will add it now.",
"hi there, i've come here in the hopes someone can give me their informed opinion.",
i've been feeling exhausted lately (11 hours sleep and still tired all day) my vision is 'snowy' like a tv not tuned in properly and my limbs ache.,
when i was at work my brain felt muddled and i had a low attention span.,
my bloods were drawn and the doctor gave me a sick note.,
everything was normal except my blood glucose was 6.5 which the doctor said was the high end of normal but he still wants me to do a glucose tolerance test which is not for ten days.,
"he doesn't think my symptoms match diabetes (i am urinating more, especially at night, but not loads and i have a dry mouth but not a great thirst.)",
should i be worried about diabetes?,
"there is no history in my family, i'm 29, female, on the light end of normal weight.",
thanks for any opinion,
i finally had my spotlight session with the other nurse and he was really nice and at the end asked me if i had children/wanted to have any (as i was the youngest in the group!),
"and i explained to him my plight of having my hormone levels tested but having to abandon it due to the diabetes diagnosis, told him about the gp telling me to drop 2 stone by august, and told him how close i was to the goal.",
"he said ""hold on while i call a co-worker and ask them a question for you"", tehn came back to tell me about a preconception diabetic team at the hospital i need to get a referral from my gp to go see.",
"i had a phone appointment with the gp who deals with girly bits (she's the one who did my implant insert and removal, but she's not my regular gp or the diabetic specialist gp at my practice) and she said she would put in the referral, but in the meantime, in addition to the 5mg of folic acid my regular gp gave me on prescription, i needed to start taking some otc vitamin d. *sigh* i was soo soo happy to not need any medication for my diabetes, bp, cholesterol, etc.",
and now i have to take all these things in the hopes that i'll get pregnant?,
this better be worth it!!,
"(okay, i know it will....) oh, and she told me there was a high likelihood that the hospital team will put me on metformin right away even though i don't need it to control diabetes because it will help me get pregnant.",
what??,
"re: now i need vitamin d, too?!",
"....and then i re-read that and realized i never actually asked my questions, did i?",
1 - what's up with now needing vitamin d in addition to the folic acid?,
"i know we lack sunshine and that's where we normally get vitamin d, but do diabetics have some kind of deficiency in it?",
2 - metformin to help get pregnant?,
what?,
how?,
why would you put someone who doesn't need metformin for their diabetes on it?,
viviennem said: did the gp say anything about which vitamin d?,
"you need vitamin d3, not any other type.",
"you can get it on amazon or e-bay, or your pharmacist will be able to get it for you.",
"i take 2500iu daily in summer, and 5000iu daily from the end of october to the end of march.",
my levels are very good for a 62-year-old!,
"click to expand... no, just ""go ask the pharmacist at boots for vitamin d"".",
"*sigh* it's a safe drug, so don't worry too much.",
"they may only put you on a low dose, or they may not give it to you at all.",
"if they do, ask them to explain why.",
"they should respect your reasons for not wanting to take medecine just for the sake of it, particularly as you're wanting to get pregnant.",
let us know how you get on!,

i will!,
i haven't yet found out when my appointment is.,
i'll have to ring the gp office to make sure the referral went.,
"angieg said: hi, metformin was up until recently presribed for pcos as it regulated periods, aided ovulation and so helped sufferers get pregnant i believe.",

statins cause birth defects and it would be absolutely irresponsible if they prescribed a statin while you are trying to get pregnant.,

i had a routine appt for my blood pressure checked this morning and mentioned about testing my sugars and them not being under 10 for the last 2/3 weeks.,
"i felt like a naughty school child , she said to me i don't understand why you feel the need to test only type 1s should be testing.",
i did tell her i will keep checking to which she said well that's your choice.,
i was then told to up my metformin to 3 per day and eventually going up to 4 per day.,
apparently because it's not been 3 months since my last set of tests she wasn't willing to take them.,
i just felt very deflated when i came out because it's like i'm not being taken seriously if that makes sense.,
i am going to continue testing regardless of what she says as it's me that pays for the strips not them.,
thank you everybody.,
i was just so shocked at the reaction i got it was like i was so naughty.,
still going to keep testing and keep an eye on things.,
thank you again,
an eventful lunchtime at home today.,
"whilst cutting open a crusty recently-baked baguette, i forgot to stop cutting before the bread knife sliced my finger .",
"ran bleeding digit under cold water, grabbed a wad of paper towel and got first aid box.",
applied steristips and a plaster which wasn't quick due to copious bleeding.,
"stood trying to cram contents back into first aid box when i was suddenly swamped by waves of nausea, heat and jellyness of legs.",
my memory of what happened next is hazy.,
as was my vision - i had the kind of heat haze effect i sometimes get when hypo.,
sat on a nearby stool.,
"wondered if blood sugar was low (was 4.7 just before all this), or low blood pressure.",
"thought in case of low bs i should stand up, reach for the baguette, sit down and eat it.",
it was the nearest source of carbs.,
"next i became aware of something rough against the side of my face, which im pretty sure was friction from the mat on the floor when i hit it.",
"at some point the mild heat haze changed to grey and really fuzzy vision, can't remember if that was before hitting the floor or as i got up.",
"dont know if i passed out and fell off the stool, or maybe stood up and then collapsed.",
dont know if i lost consciousness for a moment (i think so) or if things just got so grey and fuzzy that i didnt see the floor coming up to hit me.,
somehow found the stool again and sat on it.,
"thinks... bp monitor is in another room...to test sugar id have to cross the room,wash hands then do test.",
i was home alone.,
"various family members have had accidental head trauma resulting in a) temporary blindness, b) coma and hours of neurosurgery, and c) being found deceased.",
"didnt actually think about those events, but instinctively knew trying to stand up and walk around could be dangerous.",
"so i sat on the stool a few minutes until it felt safe to transfer to a comfy chair, picking up lucozade on the way, to sit with my feet up and drink a little lucozade and i'd be near the phone.",
"sat with my feet up for 15 minutes, then felt able to have my interrupted lunch.",
"felt washed out and decided testing bs or bp wouldnt tell me much at that stage, still not really focussed, in retrospect wish i'd tested both bs and bp at that point.",
im curious about how the collapse happened.,
i know stress can raise bs quickly but could it also make it drop suddenly?,
at the start felt as though i was about to do something nerve-racking but when sitting on the stool i had that unfocussed feeling of being hypo or slightly drunk.,
"sugar was 7 before dinner, up a bit but suggestive of extra lucozade rather than big liver dump.",
glad i hadnt injected lunch bolus!,
sue edited to say it had been a good day up to that point.... what a wooss thanks dennis and sue.,
interesting reading.,
also looked it up on medicinenet which says much the same as sue's link.,
"so i had situational vasovagal syncope, aka fainted at the sight of my own blood .",
"fine today apart from cut finger and a sore, bruised cheek.",
on reflection i'm sure i did lose consciousness briefly.,
"wonder if when i felt the rough mat on my face, that was when i was coming round and moved my head, rather than on impact.",
someone gave me good advice today - if you feel it coming on sit or lie on the floor - no further to fall and less chance of injury if you do black out!,
and don't stand for 5 mins fiddling with the first aid box etc before doing so.,
i'll try to remember that.,
"been taking it for 4 weeks, one with breakfast, one with evening meal.",
tummy upsets are not as bad as they were but still get bloating/pains.,
in the last week by nighttime i feel as if i have a rage inside me and keep snapping at everyone.,
feel so angry i could shout.,
i was reluctant to start with metformin as i'd seen the effect it had on my late mother.,
it turned her from a sweet placid lady to an aggressive unpredictable one.,
she soon stopped taking it.,
when i told the dr this she said metformin was not known for affecting mood so on the promise of helping with weight loss i started taking it.,
"i'm following a lchf diet and my blood sugars have come down, not sure if it's the diet or tablets or the combination.",
no weight loss though.,
has anyone else found it messes with your head?,
sent from my iphone using dcuk forum mobile app thanks all of you.,
"i'm wondering whether it is just mixed emotions, feeling deprived etc.",
plus how do you know whether it's the diet or tablets working?,
i will have a look for the rant section!!,
sent from my iphone using dcuk forum mobile app,
hi i have been type 1 since i was 5 and i always assumed you only got it as a child and up to early adulthood but i heard recently that you can get it in your 30's and 40's is this true?,
"hi, my first post on this forum - i was diagnosed with type 2 last tuesday.",
i'm not hugely overweight (need to lose about 7kg) and fairly young for this (44) but there is a history of it in the family so i guess i'm just wading in the shallow end of the gene pool!,
in the last week and a bit i have tried to do the right things - on a strict diet to lose weight (2kg lost so far!),
and exercising every day.,
i am also on 500mg metformin per day.,
my glucose has one from the diagnostic reading of 16 down to 5.9 this morning and has been fairly consistently at 'normal' levels since i started taking care.,
"so it's looking pretty positive really, if i can keep up the diet & exercise.",
the only thing that is really bothering me is that my eyesight seems to have suddenly got much worse in the last couple of weeks.,
"i have had reading glasses for the last year or so but i didn't really need them - only for very close-up stuff...wiring a plug, that kind of thing.",
but now i pretty much can't see without them.,
i can't read at all without them.,
i was going to go to the opticians for new glasses but i read that high sugar levels can cause the lens to swell and i wondered if this is what has happened.,
"apparently it can take 6 weeks for the lens to go back to normal, once sugar levels are normal again.",
so if that is what is causing my problem it should get better over the next couple of months i guess.,
does anyone have any experience of this?,
is it likely my suddenly worsening eyesight is due to my diabetes?,
thanks!,
"col sorry, not sure i understand...when did you have vision problems?",
when you reduced your sugar levels?,
"jeez, thanks guys...i was really freaked out.",
couldn't figure out what was going on!,
"if you just need glasses for long sightedness i'd be tempted to go with the previous advice and just buy cheap reading glasses from the supermarket until the vision settles down, which i'm told can take 4-6 weeks.",
my vision went back to normal while i was waking in dorset at the weekend...only for periods but it was encouraging that it should at some point return to normal permanently.,
it's all blurry again now.,
"also, this seems like a really common side effect of reducing sugar levels so i'm pretty disappointed that the diabetes specialist nurse at my gp practice seemed completely clueless when i said i was concerned about my blurry vision.",
in fact she completely put the wind up me by raising the whole spectre of retinopathy.,
"diabetes nurse advised me to consider changing from lantus to tresiba yesterday, to take account of fact that lantus doesn't last the full 24 hours.",
"she said that it takes 7 days for tresiba to be fully in its groove/ pattern, whereas with lantus is it 3.",
it's also less flexible when one has active vs non-active days (relevant for a teenager: my son)!,
"that said, he can be more flexible about when in the day he gives injections (no dead set time), which would be a positive.",
it's only recently been licensed for under 18 age and seems harder to get hold of for pharmacists than lantus is (consultant's prescription needed) as a downside and i also hear it can cause crashing headaches.,
so i'm slightly worried about the newness of the drug - what do people think?,
i don't want to cause any risk to my son.,
"that said, i read that lantus is potentially carcinogenic, so what do you do?",
"i have to be honest, i'm also nervous of changing the drugs.",
we've been living with t1 since november 2016 and so are relatively new to it.,
i'm a bit anxious about disturbing the status quo....any advice or thoughts from people.,
"thank you also, how do you give it, when it's a 42 hour lasting drug????",
a set number of units every 24 hours for example?,
and how do you change over/ transition from lantus to tresiba?,
thanks again.,
donnellysdogs said: i agree with activities affecting basals and stress too.,
for me tresiba is less flexible than levemir / lantus for enabling spur of moment activities.,
i only dog walk but even this is planned.,
if unplanned extra walk or even 30 min dog training lessons can throw my levels out.,
wasnt so bad with levemir.,
i do have an extra shot of insulatard at 4am.,
if i know my morning activities are going to be different i can alter this or my 8am pre getting up bolus.,
however with tresiba although flatter at night i am more limited with unplanned activities.,
"also, although tresiba will keep me flat whilst dog walking in afternoon afterwards it can still throw me low.",
my bolus would be out of my body by that time and also the insulatard peak acting would be completed.. and i dont eat till 5/6pm so its still tresiba and i do not want to eat extra pre walk just for the sake of it.. click to expand...,
thanks for replying.,
what is insulatard?,
thanks.,
"g torqpenderloin said: based on what i've read online, most people find that their daily insulin needs decreased on tresiba.",
"while i'm aware of a handful of people who were less than happy with the change, the overwhelming majority are extremely happy with it.",
i switched at the end of 2016 from levemir and have never regretted the change.,
levemir had a small benefit of allowing me to customize my dose a bit more but that was ultimately related to its much shorter absorption profile.,
"click to expand... wow, your hba1c results are amazing.",
thank you all for responding.,
much appreciated,
"i take 6 metformin the max allowed daily i inject humulin twice a day 100 units per injection i inject novorapid with meals and snacks (i carb count so injections can vary between 10 to 30 units) i get the odd good fasting reading, my daily average is usually around 21.0 - 22.0 they think i am insulin resistant, my pancreas is dead (pancreas divisum) they don't know what to do with me, tried a few insulin combos, looking at an insulin pump but my diabetic team says these cost thousands is this true?",
does anyone have one and does it work?,

but.,
lets start with a basic.,
what is your diet..?,
click to expand...,
"diet is generally good i carb count and use a carb counting book it has become my bible usually a banana for breakfast (sometimes 2 bananas or sometimes no breakfast at all) soup around 11am sandwich around 2pm main meal, around 5-6pm (meat, fish, vegetables & potatoes) i have a small amount of potatoes supper around 8pm boiled or poached egg i am not obese, i drink plenty of water especially at work (hospital) i rarely have hot drinks always look at food labels for sugar content when shopping i admit i am not always perfect kfc is a big downfall for me but i don't have the time to eat them every day lol thanks for getting in touch the soup is usually flask of broth or made up of leftover chicken (we eat a lot of chicken) yes sometimes one or two bananas or sometimes nothing at all for breakfast, for what i eat i should not have high sugars every day i was told by my consultant that my pancreas is dead, i asked outright when they discovered i had pancreas divisum after chronic bouts of pancreatitis now sometimes i do very very rarely experience hypos, usually if i get wrapped up in work and skip lunch i can feel the sensation of becoming trembly, shaky and like a sort of heat surging through my body, i test and treat, i can feel a hypo around 4.5 and under this, i have glucogel & gluco tablets always with me everywhere i go because having a hypo is not pleasant.",
my gp once told me that of all his diabetic patients i am one of a few who inject quite a lot of insulin and he told me he knows of few patients (twice my size) who only inject a quarter of the amount i take on board.,
"i am awaiting an appointment in march with my consultant, i am thinking of enquiring about a pump, i would like to know if they work for people who use them my head and scalp is always tender (i get fuzzy headed) and when i shower every morning my scalp feels like the water droplets on my head feels like pins and needle or stinging nettles, i wee a lot because i drink a lot and i have ckd to boot my late father had ckd and his father (grandfather) had diabetes and died aged 33 so i know my conditions point directly at hereditary conditions passed down sorry for the moan .",
"ladybird64 said: cumberland, we all get low points, don't get despondent .",
"i know you said you carb count (and see that you're on a lot of insulin), but how many grams of carb do you aim for daily?",
"first thing that strikes me is that there is a lot of carb in your example, the banana, if the soup is tinned then that, the sandwich for lunch and obviously the spuds but i have a feeling that it's more what you are eating earlier in the day.",
can you give us some more info about your carb intake?,
click to expand...,
"sorry for moaning, sometimes 1 or 2 bananas or nothing at all for breakfast, soup is broth or chicken from leftovers, spuds on my dinner plate.",
"yes take up a quarter of my plate, quarter veg or salad veg and the biggest portion is protein (meat/fish) with a boiled egg (sometimes a poached egg) evening yes i do think sometimes blow it i am having a kfc if in town on my day off but this an exception usually and not the norm for every 10g of carbs i inject 5 units of novorapid, 20g = 10 units thanks for responding carbsrok said: perhaps tell your team the complications you will get will cost a lot more than a few grand.",
have you tried different types of insulin?,
i asked because some people use either pork or beef insulin and have no resistance to it.,
i have a pump they cost about 3000 and the consumables are on average about 120/month.,
with blood sugars like that it sounds as if your so called team is way out of their depth so can you get a transfer to another hospital?,
do you also inject 100units in one go?,
if you this could cause a few problems with absorption so well worth splitting the dosage up to smaller amounts.,
click to expand... hi there.,
"i inject humulin at 10am and 10pm, 100 units per shot (200 units a day) and always in a different part of my body i don't have any lumps or bumps in fact it hurts more to finger prick than inject carbsrok said: have a look on the pump forum, there's a member phil (i think) who has type 2 diabetes and he was given a pump due to the amount of insulin he used and it's worked wonders for him.",
are you classed as type 2 or are you a type 3 something or other?,
click to expand...,
"thank you very much for this i will check out the pump forum as i was unaware there was one i was diagnosed as type 2 (heard of 3c) and i have questioned my diagnosis in the past as i am aware misdiagnosis is more common than we think, but i am told i am type 2 thanks once again for the heads up on the pump forum jaylee said: ""3c.""",

"had my eye screening today, it's not the first i've had as i've been diabetic for a few years now.",
"everytime i've been, the drops that widen my pupils have made my vision really blurry.",
"i went to a new opticians today as it was round the corner from mine so i could easily walk there and back, and he gave me an eye test after the drops had been put in.",
"i told him i can't really see because of the drops and he said the drops should not affect your vision, just disables your pupils from closing and everything should just look very bright.",
"he said my eyes were blurry because i have bad eye sight, and need glasses in the range of +7 in one eye and +7.5 in the other, yet i feel i can see fine without glasses.",
i have glasses at the moment but only need them for reading really small writing.,
he said even thought i can see ok without glasses my eyes are working too hard to focus and shouldn't be.,
wanted me to come back to choose some frames and get some contact lenses.,
sound like he was just wanting a sale?,
"re: retinal screening, do the drops make your vision blurred @littlegreycat half an hour after the drops, but before they took the photos, i couldn't read anything anysize off the wall during the eye test.",
"i'm just a bit confused as he is telling me my eyes are really bad and need super strong glasses and contact lenses yet i get up in the morning and without glasses can see fine, don't get eye ache, don't get headaches.",
i know that if i went into the opticians and read his chart without the eye drops i would be able to read it fine.,
"i told him this but he says yes it's because your eyes are working well at making you focus, but apparently this is a bad thing?",
going to get a second opinion but it really is confusing!,
"re: retinal screening, do the drops make your vision blurred but, noblehead, has your optician suggested you need glasses because of the blurred vision, as the drops aren't supposed to make you go blurry?",
how do you get on in the eye test they give first?,
am wondering what you replace the above with?,
"my doctor / nurse has yet to go through everything with me so forgive my ignorance however, i love sweets and choc and the thought of having to give it up is daunting.... any ideas, tips ?",

hear hear!!,
!,
did i do something wrong?,
i set up the meter to charge and read the rest of the directions.,
i applied the sensor at 11pm and checked it with the monitor.,
"the screen said that i had to wait 12 hours, just as the directions said it would.",
"at 11:30 am, the meter is telling me""sensor ended.",
"start a new sensor to check glucose.""",
"the meter came with three sensors, one each for ten days covering a month.",
i sent a note to freestyle but i doubt i will hear from today.,
i removed the old sensor and there was a very small amount of blood under it.,
any thoughts from anyone?,
karen8967 said: you need to phone abbot and they will send you are placement also the sensor should start working an hour after first scan hope this helps click to expand...,
i am not sure what you mean by that it should start working an hour after the first scan.,
the meter reported how many hours until i could see a reading right down to 12 hours later.,
"i called and yes, 5 business days and a replacement will be here.",
"they are sending a kit to send it back ""if you still have it.""",
maybe it is optional.,
they did verify the error code in the log.,
the second is working like a charm.,
take readings as often as i want is nice since i tend to analyze everything.,
the meter showed a reading of 53 but i did not feel and thing like having low sugar.,
i would at that point.,
i checked it with my original meter and it read 78.,
"high readings are only off by 5 points, probably within any test spec but the libre meter is usually lower than my other one.",
i guess i am now borg.,
third of five.,
it is interesting that the sensor retains only 8 hours of history.,
if i sleep late then i guess the data is lost for the over night shift.,
too bad they did not include a sample of test strips so that i could verify the accuracy of the sensor.,
logging in to the web site was a hassle but i think i finally activated it.,
"elliem said: i do cynically wonder whether abbott deliberately calibrate so that the meter under reads at low levels, they are possibly worried that someone will sue them because they don't pick up a hypo.... click to expand... not unlike the fuel meter in your car.",
it keeps showing full when the tank is full making you think you are getting great fuel efficiency than it seems to drop lower/faster as the tank empties.,
#NAME?,
i would love to know what is happening.,
in the first month of using this system.,
"1) out of box failure (replaced) ""replace sensor"" after 12 hour delay.",
return requested.,
2) abnormally low readings (replaced) but worked the full 10 days.,
3) worked well until i accidentally pulled out when taking my tee shirt off on day 4.,
4) out of box failure.,
"after the 12 hours, it kept telling me to wait more 10 minutes more until it stopped.",
5) out of box failure.,
"""replace sensor"" after 12 hour wait.",
i will be calling them again on monday and i wonder if they are going to replace the last three sensors.,
special care is taken with each application.,
my insurance will not pay for sensors until july 10th.,
i cannot believe the precautions needed to send a sensor back.,
place it in a baggie then into a second baggie.,
place the two into a bubble pack pouch which was way too small for the sensor and two baggies.,
at least the box and prepaid return postage was supplied.,
"one thing i have seen with the last two total failures is that the tiny point that, i figure, is supposed to pierce the skin is folded over instead.",
i was extremely careful in removing the last one.,
maybe my skin is more tough than that of others?,
one thing i just realized is that the location where i was placing the sensors is where i had a significant number of insulin injections and the area was hardened more than others.,
that would certainly be a problem for such a thin filament.,
"additionally, the skin on the side/back of my arm is hardened as a result of many years of gardening and natural exposure.",
"i was also placing the sensor on my left arm and noted that as i was getting out of the truck, would allow it for being tugged at by either the seat belt or the side post of the door frame.",
will it matter if i place the sensor under the arm where the skin is softer and more protected?,
i also purchased some waterproof adhesive patches to further protect the sensor from being grabbed.,
there is a notice out there that says that freestyle is not issuing any more sensor monitors for now because they cannot seem to keep up with the demand.,
i will discuss my findings with them that maybe they can improve such a great product.,
aside from an 80% failure rate (4 of 5) i remain totally sold on this system.,
it remains to be seen of this continues and that i/we work out the problems.,
i just called libre and they are replacing the three sensors that failed and they will be here in 5 business days.,
(monday 6/10 or so) i am presently without a sensor and my insurance will re-issue them on the 9th.,
i will contact them to see if they will allow one replacement that i can get from the pharmacy in 24 hours.,
"being able to take a reading at any time, i wonder if it would be better to go to fast acting insulin instead.",
it should be able to give me better control.,
"when the system was working for those 14 days, i was having fun showing off my borg implant: i would show my readings using the meter at the doctor's office and standing in line at the grocery store, etc.",
i keep seeing posts directed at newbies telling them not to eat root vegetables.,
"i know parsnips have a high carb content, raw carrots seem to be ok for a lot of posters and i think you would have to eat a lot of cooked carrots for them to have an effect.",
especially if you are not relying on them as the only vegetable on your plate.,
"radishes are eaten with salads, celeriac is a popular vegetable with many here as are turnips and swede, not forgetting horseradish.",
a few slices of beetroot with a salad seems ok as long as it is not just a plate of leaves.,
so to me it's only parsnips and potatoes that could affect my blood sugars.,
a meter will tell you what your tolerance is rather than dismiss all root vegetables.,
does anyone find that every root vegetable is off the menu?,
"i have found, through testing myself, that i can tolerate celeriac but not carrots.",
"so for me, i am cautious of vegetables which grow underground.",
"as with all foods, test yourself and see how each affects you.",
"hi i am on the borderline of suffering with diabetes, please can you give me some advice of different foods i can eat.",
"i have been eating porridge made with water, fruit, veg, baked beans and granary wholemeal bread.",
found out that potatoes were not a good food to have.,
best wishes asheee,
hello!,
i have recently bought a blood glucose test as i am interested in tracking my results.,
i am not diagnosed as diabetic.,
yesterday i had a fasting test result of 5.7.,
two hours after eating it was 6.7.,
i did a test as soon as i woke up this morning (13/14 hours since last eating) and it was 6.8.,
i'm not sure what is happening here and if it is anything to be concerned about.,
everyone on this forum has more experience with glucose tests and i was wondering whether anyone had any experience of this and would be able to tell me what was going on.,
many thanks!,
"azure said: @tcad95 what do you mean by ""tracking your results""?",
i don't understand why you bought a glucose tester.,
are you at high risk of diabetes?,
"in a person without diabetes, blood sugar moves up and down in a normal range between approx 3.5 and 8 with occasional spikes up to 10 after a big meal.",
click to expand...,
i am overweight and wish to know what my blood sugar level is.,
i am interested to see how my body reacts to certain meals and during fasting.,
i only see having more information about myself as a good thing and it has thrown up this anomaly of a fasting result being higher than a result after a meal.,
"i took part in a diabetes group last week and one of the things we were told is that diabetics should wear something on their feet at all times, even indoors.",
do you do this?,
i love being barefoot indoors.,
i can understand wearing footwear outside - although being barefoot in the garden was always a joy too - but inside too seems a bit excessive.,
what do you do?,
"hello, i am the oh of a recently diagnosed type 2 diabetic.",
this is all brand new to us as nobody in either family has suffered diabetes before.,
oh has been prescribed 3 x 500mg of metformin per day.,
"is it normal to have what can only be described as a fuzzy head for most of the day, as well as moderate lethargy?",
help please :?,
morning!,
thanks for your responses.,
we are going to see our gp tonight for an update on bloods taken last week and hopefully he can shed some light on this fuzzy head?,
every twinge or pain is so worrying though as it is all brand new and their is so much conflicting information to read.,
maybe that is the cause of his fuzzy head :?,
thanks for the tips and advice.,
"oh feeling much better today just a bit nervous about trip to docs, but i guess he'll have to get used that.",
will update on how we get on,
ok ok i like a drink (or 10!!),
when i was diagnosed i told my nurse i like to go out and drink at weekends as i didn't want to hide anything from her after all she needs all the information she can get to help me control my diabetes.,
as i drink lager i was devastated when i was diagnosed (t1)thinking my social life would now be non-existant as i would have to stop drinking it.,
"however, she told me to try it out i.e.",
drink it and test regularly which i do whenever i go out and i have found that it doesn't put my bg up much at all!!!!,
wey hey!!!!,
i also like red wine which i know is less carbs so better for me than lager but just not the same going out and drinking wine all night!!,
(i save wine for the house!!),
"i've seen that much information about lager and read on other diabetes discussion boards coments such as ""if you want to kill yourself carry on drinking lager"" and ""do not, under any circumstances drink lager"" just wondered your opinions!",
also as i'm now on insulin is it true that i can eat and drink what i like????,
craving a kit kat chunky but daren't!!!!!!!!!!,
well its nice to know i'm not alone and committing the biggest sin ever by enjoying a drink as a diabetic!!!!,
just having a nice glass of wine..........bliss thanks for replies - i take my testing kit out with me and keep a check every hour.,
bs levels are same day after as on any other day but i do test more regularly just in case!,
i know i should stop drinking but is it really harming me if my bs levels don't go up???,
(apart from the obvious binge drinking aspect that is!!),
only diagnosed since september so it will probably change and i will have to stop drinking me favourite carling!!!!,
that's life i guess!,
hi everyone... just wondering if anyone on this forum has or has had a hiatal hernia.,
if so... what is your experience with it?,
how are you managing?,
have you been successful in controlling symptoms and how?,
if you've had surgery... was it successful?,
"i know, i know... lots of questions i have.",
:lol: but i have only found out in january that i have a hiatal hernia after a lot of medical tests and appointments.,
"i'm now into my 5th year of chronic stomach symptoms which include pain in mid lower chest; diaphram, oesophagal, and throat spasms that can cause aching for days; nausea; loss of appetite; chronic burping sometimes 24/7; hiccups; distended stomach so bad it hurts and i feel i may explode; occasional upset bowel; low iron level; occasionally almost choking on my medications.",
i have found that managing bgls has been quite hard with this problem.,
i'm not sure what is next?,
i have an appointment coming up at end of this month with gastroenterology dept at the hospital.,
to be honest i've been getting the run around and no real answers that can help me.,
my endocrinologist wants to know what's going on too as he can see i'm generally unwell.,
"i've been on about 10 different medications for my stomach... probably all the anti-acids and inhibitor drugs, anti-depressants to calm stomach nerves (which i had very bad reactions to).",
not sure what other meds they can put me on?,
they keep talking about a banned drug that is known to cause heart problems... if they get approval from the govt they say i will need to have regular ecgs.,
i'm not keen on that idea.,
i'm just interested to know if there is a possibility there could be an end to all my symptoms that are really beginning to drive me insane and it's totally inteferring in every area of my life.,
i'd like to know what works for others.,
"thanks hi, reading through your post, cannot imagine how it must feel with this never ending cycle of trying to sort the problem.",
i have a friend who suffers from gastroparesis and am wondering if you have been tested for this?,
the symptoms you describe are so similar to the complaint you have been diagnosed with and it does affect people with diabetes.,
"there is a link here, http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddisease ... roparesis/ if you have not been investigated for this, it is worth mentioning.",
if you have then my apologies.,
"thanks catherine .... yes, my gp thinks i may have a bit of gastroparesis too.",
"although from what i've read on the net, a hiatal hernia also causes the same symptoms i have and they have found i have one... although i don't know its size exactly.",
i do know it's big enough to fit egg and toast in it though.,
i only know this as i had a gastric emptying study done about a year ago... that's where they get you to eat egg & toast with a bit of radiation stuff in it to track it with the scanning machine.,
they scan you periodically over 4 hours.,
my test showed problems in the first 2 hours of the test... although this wasn't reported on because they were only looking for the outcome after 4 hours and my test came out normal... 96% of my stomach had emptied.,
so that means they don't consider i have gastroparesis.,
after the first hour though the egg and toast was balled up in my chest.,
i had 4 technicians in the room and they asked me twice whether or not i had ever had gastric banding done.,
i answered 'no'.... goodness i should know that one right?,
but then they showed me why.... the screen showed the food balled up in my lower chest... exactly where i get the pain and nausea.,
then at the 2 hour mark they found something else abnormal... my food was balled up in the top of my stomach... where i get pain.,
even though this test was a year ago... unfortunately they weren't bright enough to pick up that they were actually looking at a hernia.,
my pain and symptoms haven't really changed.,
now that i know i have one... it makes sense why they asked me if i had gastric banding done because what they were looking at was actually my stomach in my chest and the diaphram wall going over the top of it so it would've looked like a band to them.,
"i doubt this will be of any help at all, but i had one after catching whooping cough when i was a baby.",
"i had a repair at 6 years old, that has stayed repaired even with 5 pregnancy`s.",
i hope they find a way to fix yours so well.,
glad to hear jeannemum that you had yours fixed at an early age.,
i have heard that coughing can cause one.,
:smile: @mistee71 - wow... your whole family almost there with one.,
"i'm currently on 2 meds for my stomach... esomeprazole (aka: nexium), and domperidone (aka: motilium).",
this medication has stopped the acid reflux part... but i still have all the other symptoms.,
and i can still burp my food and water back up too.,
so you're starting to burp too?,
i timed my burping was every 8 seconds when i'm really bad.,
"i've pretty much been burping bad since end of 2009, before then it was pain and reflux.",
at times i burp so hard that it triggers hiccups and i have both at the same time... usually happens in the middle of the day when i'm at work too.,
"i figure keeping my mouth shut will help elleviate the sound a bit, but it doesn't really.... people can still tell i'm burping and i often get the unwanted comment or two and stares.",
i have been off my pills before and the pain does get worse for me too... but i have the pain when i'm taking pills too... but more like cramps and spasms mainly.,
"also mistee... have to ask, do you find it impacts on your diabetes management also?",
:lol: sounds really funny.... your poor mum.,
has docs advised what to do to fix it?,
can they do surgery or something?,
i get impression here that they aren't willing to do surgery for most cases.,
i get really embarrassed with this burping myself... no doubt i probably scare or annoy people around me.,
i have burped every day and night since end of 2009 and i actually think it could be causing the oesophagal and throat spasms i periodically get.... usually smack in the early hours of the morning and it's pretty scary.,
if i don't burp for a bit i get heart palpitations usually (and sometimes whilst talking)... probably the gas building up i suppose.,
"i've also noticed that there is pressure near my voice box... hurts to talk sometimes, although more so if i've had a spasm.",
but with diabetes management i find that it can be hard to get bgls predictable at all.,
i think my food doesn't even start to digest until 3 hours after i've eaten or so.,
sometimes i get a hypo 1.5 hours after eating because i inject within 15 minute timeframe like endo told me too.,
oh that's not fair for your mum... but from what i read they don't like to operate unless they have to.,
my understanding though is that if meds aren't working that is their only option.,
it's not very nice living with so many symptoms.,
i'm sure your mum would be feeling worn out and exhausted from it all.,
does she get the spasms and all too?,
i've been told by my gp that those spasms make men go to er thinking it's their heart.,
it's the same sensation... really aweful.,
i'm not even 40 yet and i don't particularly want to carry on like this for the rest of my life.,
managing diabetes is enough.... don't like that either really.,
yes i'm in australia... but west.... getting a bit late and i should be heading off to noddy land now.,
:lol: we've currently got about 4 different time zones here.,
@mistee - victoria are 3 hours ahead of me.,
"although, yes this silly thing often keeps me awake.",
i find if i move it wakes me.,
i woke up this morning with a big cramp under rib cage on my left.,
burping as usual.,
@bigfatpaulie - it's a relief for you that the drug does actually work.,
@sheep - good to hear the drug works for you also.,
my doc says he reckons drugs are only helping a small percentage with me.,
i'm not sure what's next?,
i have symptoms all the time.,
it gets a bit much at times.,
:roll: have a good rest mistee even though i've been up over an hour i'm way too tired and i'm thinking i need more sleep.,
"yes, i will need to just persevere until i get a resolve.... hopefully this year!",
i've just heard on the radio that george michael's death was due to fatty liver!!,
"- am quite shocked, i have fatty liver but i didn't know you could die from it.",
can someone enlighten me please before i worry myself silly?,
thanks lovinglife said: i don't think you have to worry - he also had massive heart problems which i think may have been the main reason with the fatty liver as a contributing factor.,
"he abused his body for many years with drugs and alcohol- god rest his soul, lots of people not just diabetics have fatty liver and live long and healthy lives in ignorance.",
i had a lot of respect for george a most generous man and much misunderstood- finally his family can lay him to rest click to expand...,
thank you.,
"yes, i too was shocked of his sudden death and i do know that some celebrities abuse their bodies with drugs and alcohol (i think david bowie also took a lot of drugs in his younger years).",
i hate having fatty liver (and diabetes) and it's just a constant battle for me to lose weight which i know would help my fatty liver a lot and i try so hard with weight loss.,
i cannot wait until i am a healthy weight with a healthy bmi.,
good morning i was hoping for some advice before i phone my stupid surgery again...!!!,
i had my first hba1c test on the 11th january when i made this appointment (i had to make the appointment myself i wasn't called in) i requested a printout of my results i was told yes but ask the nurse who takes your blood !!,
so i did and on 13th jan i phoned to see if my results were back they were so i said i'd pop down and get the results ... oh no you can't do that we can't give them to you you will be contacted if there's a problem??,
i explained i'd asked to be told either way as i've been working hard to lower my bg the receptionist said ok i'll request your doctor to write to you i thought finally!!!!,
meanwhile i'd made another appointment off my own back to have a diabetic check up like foot care etc .. for the 30th jan.,
i received a letter from my doctor yesterday saying your blood results are normal please keep your appointment on the 30th to discuss !!!!.....,
normal!?!?!?,
what is normal???,
should i be expected to wait this long to be told when all i really want is one number !!!!,
am i being unreasonable!!!,
i did that but just got fobbed off i just want to know how low i've gone from 99 to what ??,

i get my results that way..keeps contact with the surgery to a minimum and is better for my blood pressure.,
click to expand... no i've not done that but it's sounds like a great idea thank you just been to the doctors and asked for my results or for someone who can tell me them to phone me !!!,
i only have to wait till the 24th now that's when the next available phone call is ?!?!,
absolute joke but i have registered online now not sure if that will be much here.... been online and saw blood results tab i'm sorry this surgery does not offer this option but i can make an appointment or repeat prescription,
i found some sugar free biscuits in home bargains!,
they are lovely (digestives and shortbread which taste like rich tea) and i do miss a couple of biccies with a cup of tea in the afternoon....especially when the rest of the family is tucking in!,
"but, they have about the same amount of carbs as regular biscuits.........so is it worth buying the sugar free?",
"gp/diabetes nurse say not to cut out anything, just watch what you eat - not very helpful!",
lol...i think the excitement of sugar free and biscuit in the same packet got to me and i didn't read the carbs info on the back!,
"so, now i've got them, are they slightly better than regular biscuits or does it not make any difference?",
carbs are 4.5g per biscuit vs 6.9g in the rich tea i usually buy.,
two occasionally as part of a low carb diet surely can't be too bad!,
"thanks for replying....yes, i can only eat one, i haven't really got a sweet tooth, just occasionally fancy a biscuit with a cup of tea...nothing else really compares!",
"i have a dash of skimmed milk, or just black...i can't stomach weak milky tea, so cream would be disgusting (for me ) but i quite like in cream in coffee!",
actually this is two queries: 1.,
does novorapid get into your system as quickly as simple carbohydrates and white carbohydrates so it could be argued that so long as the dose of novorapid matches the total amount of carbs there is no difference between eating say white bread vs wholemeal bread in terms of effect on blood sugars?,
2,
"is there a limit to how often you can take novorapid in a short period of time, eg yesterday i ate something took my bolus dose, then an hour later ate something else and took a bolus dose and then a little while later was still hungry (ok maybe just picking!)",
so did same thing.,
i figured that a non diabetic person will just naturally produce the right amount of insulin whenever they eat so why can't i do the same with the novorapid.,
but then a couple of hours later i went hypo.,
"not sure if that's because i had too much novo, or if it was due to taking it in separate doses rather than eating all the food at once and injecting the same amount of novo all at once.",
"i guess i am presuming that novorapid acts like the insulin a non diabetic would produce, but how true is this?",
thanks ac ok i guess that means it is better to have one big meal and inject all your novorapid rather than say a meal and inject a bit then have a snack a couple of hours later and inject some more.,
that's slightly counter-intuitive as i would have presumed it was better not to hit your body with all the carbs all at once but i stand corrected!,
also are you guys injecting before you eat?,
"i tried that but found a few times i would get full up /distracted/ decide i didn't want to eat what i was eating and having already taken the novo was committed to either eating the original meal or else having some different carbs to the same amount, or else go hypo, but i am thinking now maybe to take some novorapid before the meal and some after, so that it is getting to work straight away and i'm not waiting for it to catch up with the food?",
hi everyone.,
i am a type 1 who tries to do everything right.,
good diet/excercise etc.,
i keep my levels around 4.2-5.8.,
but to do this i need to test around 7 times a day.,
"this was no problem in australia where i was diagnosed, but today my diabetes nurse told me i couldn't have that many strips.",
she says i only need to test once every 3 days.,
once!,
if that was all i could test my levels would be all over the place and i would get very ill very quickly.,
does anyone know if the nhs are obligated to give me the strips i need?,
i have a meeting with my gp tomorrow... that's what i thought.,
but how can a db nurse not know the difference?,
is there some sort of legal obligation?,
i mean can i demand them?,
"sure, in the long run i would cost less money.",
but right now (in this adminsitration's budget) it is slightly more expensive to give me the strips.,
"i will only cost money when i get ill, in another adminstration's budget.",
so they don't care about what happens in 10 or 20 years really... that's why i need to know if i can insist :?,
thanks for the support.,
"but if i demand and he says no, is there some legislation i can quote?",
or some regulatory body that will help me?,
"(i am afraid that if i speak to the pct i will get somebody who does not understand db and will say ""do as the doctor says..."") thanks guys.",
i will certainly make my case with the gp.,
"if he doesn't understand/refuses to help, i will speak to the practise manager.",
"but if i have to go to the pct, who should i speak to?",
"i mean if they don't understand db type 1, won't they just take the gps word for it?",
sue thanks for the guidelines.,
they should be helpful,
"hello all, just after some advice.",
was diagnosed with pre-diabetes a couple of years ago.,
hb1ac was around the 6-7 mark.,
"had some additional health issues and diet/exercise wasnt bringing it down, so doc put me on metformin about 18months ago.",
"through one thing and another i didnt go to my checkups, and stopped taking all my medication about 6m ago (yep i know, idiot) but recently moved so at new patient checkup they did some bloodtests and my results came back and my hb1ac was 12.",
started taking the metformin again.,
this was about a month ago.,
for the last 4 days ive had the thirst from hell and am going to the toilet 5-6 times a night.,
i checked my bg and it was 24.8mmol.,
"have been checking periodically over the last 24 hours and the lowest its been is 14.6mmol obviously whenever i eat, it spikes back up to around the 20mmol mark.",
"now starting to get kidney pain, probably as my kidneys are working overtime to get rid of the excess glucose.",
have trace amounts of ketones in urine.,
"i read exercise can help reduce the hyper, but have read elsewhere doing so can actually increase bg levels?",
not sure what to do atm.,
doctors is shut till monday.,

or an out of hours surgery?,
"if i were you i would find out and pay them a visit this afternoon, without wasting any more time.",
"failing that, do not eat anything with carbs in between now and when you can get to the doctor.",
"no carbs means no bread, no spuds, no rice, no pasta, no pastry, no batter, no cereals, no fruit or milk, nothing made from flour or grains.",
"eat meat, fish, salads, cheese, cream, and drink as much water as you can.",
"click to expand... nothing local, no.",
am drinking around 4litres a day atm due to this awfull thirst.,
was worried about fasting in case i have problem with increased ketone?,
thanks everyone.,
"i got admitted, when they checked my bg it was 30.7 :-s. they put me on a drip.",
when they rechecked by bg it was down to 16.7.,
"however, this was 24 hours without food.",
i was then allowed a sandwich.,
the next morning it was down to 12.7.,
was discharged today with an increase in my metformin to 2550g per day ( up from 1000g).,
"im surprised they only checked my bg 3 times in 2 days, and none really that show my post meal figures.",
"also, im sure the amount of iv fluid i was getting would be diluting my blood, so again not confident now im off the iv my bg will stay low and what it will do once ive had a decent meal.",
"my understanding though is that metformin is really only useful in reducing bg down by a couple of mmol, so is it really going to be able to cope with highs of 30?",
"im no doctor, and maybe just upping the metformin will be enough, however, my gut instinct is, it wont?",
"thanks, going to make appointment to see gp in a day or 2.",
"i did get a bunch of blood work done, but not sure if any of them show insulin levels.",
how do they decide if someone is type 1 or 2?,
"my blood work came back as, hb 159 wcc 8.7 platelets 224 mcv 84.3 neutrophils 6.0 lymphocytes 1.9 monocytes 0.6 eosinophils 0.1 glucose 29.8 na 131 urea 5.7 creatinine 76 albumin 43 bilirubin 10 alp 93 alt 47 crp 10 hi jack, can i ask what your taking to treat your t2?",
"i've had this morning quite an upset stomach and have been on metformin now for three weeks, increasing my dose over that time period.",
i haven't had much stomach issues - just twice - and i'm wondering if anyone else has found that certain foods don't agree with them when they are on metformin?,
i've been wondering this as both times i think i had eaten an omelette or eggs of some description.,
i read on line of one person who had a similar reaction but they said they thought it was egg yolks and that egg whites didn't give them this issue.,
"hi, does anyone have any experience with l-arginine, i'm interested in dosage levels and long term effects, it seems very beneficial does anyone ever stop eating it and is it really helping my nerves re-generate (it certainly feels like it is) i discovered it by accident really but it has achieved in one swoop what three medications from the doctor (with horrible side effects) could not achieve i can't believe nobody told me about this stuff, someone out there must know more than i do, please ?",
"patch said: i've looked into it, but never tried it.",
"how much are you taking, how often, and what for?",
"click to expand... hi patch, it was suggested to me as part of a diet that was supposed to cure erectile disfunction, to my amazement it does actually help and has increased sperm volume (i haven't put it under a microscope to gauge motility).",
it is definitely helping with my neuropathy and blood pressure and gives me a near normal reading on my blood sugar even after trying to make it higher with crunchies (just to see).,
"i'm taking three tablets of 1000mg a day after my evening meal, i tried taking them on an empty stomach but i cramped a bit, taking them after food seems to work.",
"i bought the tablets at the healthfood shop but i only bought enough for a months trial (90 pills for 20 uro) but have just bought a 1kg foil pouch of powder for 50 uro inc postage, this should be a six month supply and i'm thinking of upping the dose to 5g a day when it comes.",

"m indy51 said: nuts and berries are usually low carb, so they should be fine?",
"click to expand... from what i can make of it so far (and i am relatively new to this,) it seems that carbs do get turned into sugars but we do need some to function on and taking sugary foods like strawberries fresh orange juice chocolate etc will put our blood sugar up quicker than a slow release carb like porridge oats however i also have noticed that lentils and nuts make my bs go through the roof really easily too i used to love nut roast and dahl, rice and chapatis) ,if i thought i was stressed enough before for it to make diabetes come on it certainly hasn't helped since it got here, lol nosher8355 said: hi, yes, i'm in permanent ketosis, you don't need carbs to live.",
"but you can't get away from them completely as they are everywhere, the trick is to eat foods that are very, very low in carbs.",
"i only eat food in very small proportions, if i have nuts, a handful at most, berries, two or three.",
"but something like porridge or orange juice, i can't touch, always rocket my blood levels even one spoonful.",
"the statement that we need a carb balanced diet is absolutely rubbish, unless you need some for other medical problems than blood glucose disorders.",
"if you are new, reduce your carbs, reduce your plate size and if you can exercise more.",
when you get used to eating lower your body will respond from the healthier lifestyle.,

"this is the thing i find weird about it all, people seem to have pre-conceived ideas about who gets to be diabetic, i don't sit around stuffing my face in front of the telly all day.",
"i am a 55 yr old man who farms for a living, i have 27 horses (amongst other animals) to look after,(which means i never get a day off whether i'm ill or not) they can all run faster than me but i seem to do more walking than any of them and a hell of a lot more carrying stuff around, i won't go into a list of the manual labour jobs i do around the place running a farm on my own but i will add that i am 5' 10 inches tall and vary between 13 to 13.5 stone which is by no means obese and i know from experience that if i try to do a day fencing or shoveling poo or splitting logs etc without putting ""fuel in the tank"" then i will make myself ill, i tend to get the shakes when my bs goes down to about 3, what i find is that i need to eat reasonably and reasonably often and every time i eat i have to take metformin to stop the sudden hike of sugar levels, even if i eat just meat and salad, it's my pancreas that isn't functioning, not my arms and legs.",
"i used to be able to eat a meal and run for ages off the energy but no longer, now i have to keep stopping to re-fuel and eat less at a time, these days if i eat a big meal i tend to fall asleep after... food coma catladynz said: i'm not 100% sure metformin is necessarily the right match for your needs, since you are of normal weight and you seem to have quite fluctuating bg levels.",
perhaps you have a different type of diabetes than t2 (there are dozens).,
can you tell us what your bg readings are like over the course of a day?,
"i could be going off on a tangent so if i am don't mind me, i'm just cautious and curious.",
click to expand...,
"i had no idea there were more than two types of diabetes, in fact i'm hardly educated at all concerning it, all iknow is that my doc sez i'm type two and that after my sis (paramedic 300 miles away) told me to go and tell him to test me, he did and my bs was 24 at the time, he got me a test kit and told me to test in the morning before bfast, which i do (sometimes) i did (with 850mg metformin, 4 times daily and 60 mg diamicron) eventually get it down to 9/10 but with stomach cramps and still the constant headaches etc, then after complaining about pains in the legs etc too i ended up on a cocktail of drugs which left me with an inability to function at all (brain fog, vertigo, short term memory loss, inability to think) and i spent a lot of time lying on the settee feeling too ill to move as every time i did i got dizzy.",
"so eventually i stopped taking everything and started again, now i'm on 500mg of metformin 4 times daily 60mg of diamicron and have altered my diet as best i can, i wasn't taking anything for the neuropathy as i felt it better to be in pain and be able to think but i have some nerve damage to my feet and lower legs, erectile disfunction etc,... untill the l-arginine which seems to help with the neuropathy (i'm told nothing can cure it) and my blood sugar which was hovering around 10 / 12 is now down to 8 ish in the mornings, when i was first given the kit i used to test myself during the day too to see what was happening but i was getting readings of 18 ish an hour or so after eating and figured that i was screwing up my average on the meter..",

acceptable levels of 50 or more [results of vitamind blood test] is okay for own body supplies of well functioning vitamind.,

i am type 2 and have just finished treatment for breast cancer.,
i am currently taking letrozole tablets (hormone tablet) and my blood sugars have gone up.,
i believe and have had it confirmed that these will alter my blood sugars.,
the diabetic nurse however doesn't seem to want to know.,
they are all threatening to put me on insulin which i don't want.,
"i currently take metformin slow release, gliclazide and just added to the list linagliptin.",
"bluetit1802 said: there isn't much you can do about the raised blood sugars caused by the letrozole, and you will have to take the letrozole for either 5 or 10 years.",
"the stress of the breast cancer and the initial treatment, whether it was surgery, chemo (with steroids of course), radiotherapy or all 3 will have contributed to raised levels at the time.",
"if you want to avoid insulin, maybe it is time to have a serious look at your diet.",
the fewer carbs you eat the lower your blood sugar will become (and the less medication you will need).,
"reducing or eliminating potatoes, rice, pasta, bread, cereals and flour will help enormously, but if you go down this route you need to speak to your nurse as your medication may need adjusting downwards to avoid hypos.",

i will carry on coping with my recent cancer treatment and view my diabetes as secondary to that.,
you have all given me strength to carry on with that thought too.,
a happy new year to you all.,

"hi guys i have been ill for a while more with hypo symptoms such as severe sweating, fatigue, faint/dizzy spells, mood swings, confusion, clumsy etc i had some bloods done a few weeks ago and was called back in for some more but fasting this time (didn't say why/what) i have tested myself when having symptoms and a few times caught bloods at between 3.0-3.7 but when i had my bloods done at the docs i felt reasonably ok (my fasting test was done half an hour after getting up and i'm usually fine for about an hour of getting up then i start to feel funny) anyway had bloods yesterday and today saw the doc, first thing he said is are you a big drinker ..no ..right well you have some liver function issues (high cholesterol i think he said as well) and something else which are all linked to fat in the blood (like i say i get confused so can't remember word for word) also your bloods were raised and close to diabetic levels (think he meant the ones that measure over 2 months but could be wrong) i used over 60 strips in a month or less and highest i saw was 7 and rarely was it above 5.9 anyway i mentioned my symptoms (the reason i am there in the first place and the fact they are controlling my life totally and can't even work) and he seemed baffled, told me hypoglycemia was something diabetics got due to drugs etc (despite all i have seen about reactive hypos etc on the net) and this is also the diabetic expert at my docs surgery all i came out with was lose weight and eat less (both are difficult considering how i get after 3/4 hours without food and the fact i am so fatigued i often can't exercise (i cycle or walk 2-4 times a week usually) about 2 stone overweight maybe more, but he didn't give me anything to go on other than that, didn't confirm if i was pre-diabetic, denied reactive hypoglycemia existed and basically just left there more confused than when i went in, also very angry as its ruining my life, goes on much longer and i will be going to the docs and ringing ambulances everyday till they find out whatever it is wrong with me because i am desperate any advice much appreciated , p.s i have stopped eating simple carbs almost totally just having oj or glucose tabs when hypo symptoms appear sometimes but try not to in case i have a rebound later.",
"i just want to know what is wrong with me and get sorted before i lose the will cheers greeny thanks indy hi mate yeah my liver bloods levels came back raised, trigs and fats or something, left pretty much in the dark though and to get on with it, all i got was a crude drawing of what a plate of food should look like, felt like punching him the patronizing sod, good job i didn't have the energy and was too dizzy to get up i went into the diabetic center at hospital on my own bat on friday after having an ecg and told her what was happening (i was sweating badly but no other symptoms at the time) she tested me there and it was 7.5 but i had just eaten (a healthy wholegrain turkey meatball wrap from a health food take out place) about 45 mins/ 1 hour prior i am on a few tablets for depression, fluoxetine, propranolol and zopiclone sleeping tablets i'm bloody fed up with it all and its not the above causing it as been in them years (apart from changed anti depressants 3/4 times)",
i have a craving for chocolate every day.,
i sometimes eat it more than once a day.,
has anyone stopped eating it altogether?,
morning so last night before i went to bed at 9.30 i was a 10 something.,
"woke up at 1.15 ish and brain was whizzing so out of interest did a test, it was 6.8.",
took me a while (probably till 2.30-3) to get back to sleep.,
just did my wake up test at 5.50am and my sugars have increased to 8.0.,
but i havent eaten or drank anything.,
is it lack of sleep that has increased my sugars or likely something else?,
"ha, so basically blood sugar will do what it wants, when it wants regardless of what it should do?",
so anything and everything can muck it up?,
i am 18 years old and non diabetic .... can please someone tell what happens if took two tablets of glyclazide or diamichron (other name) i had a really bad head ache and i mixed the tablets with my mum.,
its been two hours and i havnt eaten anything thankyou how long does it take to start its effect?,
thanks nosher8355 said: give it fifteen minutes!,
"eat something again, if you still feel wobbly.",
click to expand...,
"thanks andbreathe said: am i correct thinking you had a headache, then took a couple of gliclazide tablets in error, thinking they were you headache tablet?",
did you go on and take something for your headache?,
how are you feeling now?,
"i think, provided your body is nice and healthy, it should be able to work to keep you safe, after a single dose of glaclazide.",
"the longer since you took it you feel ""ok"", the better.",
click to expand...,
yes actually my mums tablets were there too and i took it in hurry thinking it was asprin but when i found out i didnt take anything else as i know that it could cause a reaction andbreathe said: thanks for that.,
how are you feeling now?,
click to expand...,
i am okay now thankyou sunnyexpat said: they would have have little effect on you.,
"they cause you to release more insulin, but your liver would dump glucose if your blood sugar goes too low, if you didn't eth.",
so it regulates itself.,
click to expand... ahan okay thanku,
"during a day at work (teaching) whilst i am dieting, i quite often need a top up of sugar levels.",
"at the moment, i swig lucozade which is good because it acts so quickly, but are there any better alternatives?",
"there's no fat in it which is obviously good but can anyone suggest a more practical, healthy substitute?",
i recently had a glucose tolerance test done my results were as follows fasting 6.2 2 hours after glucose 10.4 my doctor said i have pre diabeties but dont worry about it as im not diabetic but im just worried and dont really know what this means.,
"also when i had the test i was told to fast overnight from midnight well i fasted from 4pm as i was feeling unwell and didnt feel like eating i thought seeing as i had to fast anyway it wont make a difference, but my sister who is diabetic told me this was too long to fast and could have affected the result is this true and if so should go back to my doctor and ask to be retested?",
i had the test at 9am so it was 17 hours i fasted for any advice would be greatly appreciated thanks for all the responses.,
i bought a g;lucose meter today so i can keep an eye on sugar levels and im going to change my diet join a gym and try to loose a stone hopefully this will help.,
i had an appointment with the doctor today and he said the extra time i fasted for would not have affected my blood test.,
"i know all this has probably been discussed before, but after reading a few posts today about weight being involved, genetics, and diet etc, i realise more and more that there is no rhyme and reason to diabetes.",
"take this example: me - quite thin, was active, ate a healthy diet i thought, with only an occasional treat.",
my waist is 29 inches.,
i don't drink alcohol either.,
"hubby - a tad overweight ( about 2 stones), non active - uses car for everything, walks nowhere, couch potato really.",
"eats tons of sweet foods, carbs etc.",
loves a four pack of lager once a week.,
so why me and not him?,
his waist is about 40 inches and i have been reading that large middle girth is often a pointer for docs to be suspicious.,
i have never had a large girth unless i was pregnant!,
he actually is doing all the things that i have read we have to change in order not to become diabetic.,
i was already doing them but told prediabetic anyway.,
neither of us have any diabetes in the family that we know of.,
this isn't a moan but i am still scratching my head and more so when i look at my husband's lifestyle.,
"well, he had some routine bloods done about 6 months ago and i have no idea if bg was tested.",
"what i am saying is, he is actually the picture of someone you wouldn't be surprised if he got diabetes.",
but i am beginning to finally believe that there is no clear picture.,
"see, if the cause is not clear, and the picture painted by the nhs is blurred when it comes to who's at risk, who can truly prevent themselves from getting diabetes where lifestyle is concerned?",
"most of the advice is 'eat healthily', and exercise.",
i was already doing that!,
"where does that leave me where the nhs is concerned because i have no weight to lose, in fact i am trying to gain weight!",
"because i don't fit their picture, i also do not fit their plan of action.",
i am about to watch a programme on channel 4 called the word's best diet.,
hmm...this should be good.,
i deserved it!,
i was following nhs guidelines on healthy eating.,
i should have known better!,
does anyone get hungry but scared to eat incase there blood sugars go up ?,
"ive had my porridge and a slice of toast for breakfast which has sent my blood up more as it was a gi food , and im still hungry re: hungery scared to eat hi pilgrim .",
"i wish i could eat fish ,, the thing is im very picky with food and it makes it real hard , i don't eat any fish , i have just had a handful of mixed nutts , but im struggling a lot now with what to eat , its hard from eating a lot of unhealthy food to healthy food , im 4 weeks into type 2 now re: hungery scared to eat denise, thankyou , that is brilliant site , the only problem i have is i am 17 stone and obese and i also need to loose weight , so full fat cream , butter, fats , that is not going to be good for me is it????",
re: hungery scared to eat ))denise(( said: have a look at http://www.dietdoctor.com/lchf - great ideas on what you can eat.,
"click to expand... hi denise i have had a look at that site and im shocked at the fat u can eat ... it seems unbelievable and altho id like to try it i am scared to try it ,, incase i put on weight ,, im obese now , surely eating butter , full fat milk ,, full fat cheese , is not good for the cholestral ,,.im not to up on the fats side of it yet , i am just starting to understand what low carbs and gi are .",
"i need to loose a lot of weight.. at the moment im trying a low carb diet and protein , lean meats ect ,, but yes im getting hungry , i am now having a omelette and chicken for my supper so i guess i will have to do a bit of research on the fat side of things hi wompa .sorry to hear about the liver , does it renew itself ??",
"after a time , ?",
were you prediabetic ?,
"before diagnosed as full diabetic, i was pre diabetic for 2 years, im not on any meds ,at the moment , and i tend to agree with you about the fats , im going to have to look for other foods to eat as the food im eating im starting to get bored of i have eat that much chicken and eggs i have gone off it hahahah :lol: but thanks guys it has been very helpful , so for now i think like wompa says the carbs are most important right now , just had a weigh in here 16st 12 from 18stone in 4 weeks ,,,, still have a very long way to go for weight loss , bs are averaging around 5.5 woke up this morning was 6.0 i do eat porridge of a morning but i find that 2 hours after my porridge i think i can cope with it brown wholemeal bread that makes my bs go high , and a simple dark ryvita also makes my bs go high ,, i am struggling with what to eat , but swings and roundabouts is homemade vegetable soup ok ,, cabbage, tin toms , leaks , onions, parsnips, carrots, pearl barley, lentils, onions, mushrooms.",
"beef stock cubes , oxos.",
"and tin of oxtail soup , i made a huge big pot full , and wondering if i can eat it freely when i am hungry ,?",
"hi connie , what sort of things were you eating , as i am finding it hard what to eat , i love my brown bread and porridge and bread covers a multitude of things and im lost without it , altho i haven't been eating bread the last five weeks i do find it difficult if i want a sandwich for quickness",
hi.,
i am interested in buying a pair of scales which calculate the nutritional value of foods and wondered if anyone has any experience of using them and whether they are worth buying.,
"i already carb count and just use the packet info or refer to my little book, but wondered whether these would make it easier - thanks.",
leggott.,
hi - thanks everyone.,
i too would be interested in those new scales synonym.,
"i do already use the little carb book, but i wanted something i could give to my kids so they could take it to friends houses for tea, just to make it easy for someone else to weigh & work out the approx carb values.",
it would be good if you could programme foods in as well if they weren't already on the scales - but this is probably asking too much!,
leggott,
"hi all, am a bit worried, have appt with gp next tues. today i felt very sweaty (hot flushes)and when i cooled down and felt horrible a work colleague said my lips had a bluish tint.",
"i looked in the mirror and there was a slight tinge, once i felt better and had a hot drink they went pink again.",
"in the past when i have had migraines i have had a bluey hint but as i have had an ecg and do not get breathless, no chest pain, no asthma, no circulation probs etc i was not worried.",
but now i am wondering if it could be something to worry about.,
"i am on thyroxine, ranitidine, simvastatin, metformin and aspirin so it is a bit of a cocktail but this morning i had taken some co-codamol as i had a bad head as well.",
have looked on internet and scared myself but i don't seem to have any other symptoms to worry about.,
"any ideas, can u put my mind at rest?",
"thanks chrissie hi sid, okay, i have an appt tuesday, am feeling better today and no more blueness.",
felt a bit panicky as she kepp going on about it !!,
thanks chrissie thanks sid people at work kept going on about it today so in the end i managed to get an appt with a gp late this afternoon.,
"he checked my bp and heart, all seemed okay, lips weren't blue then!",
he also checked my oxygen levels in blood it read 98 which he said was excellent as top number 100!,
although of course it only tells them whats happening at that time.,
"he thinks it is a sudden drop in bp when i don't feel well due to a migraine, high glucose or whatever which causes my face to lose colour then the blood doesn't pump as well and the blueish tinge appears.",
also because i get very hot then cold quickly he says i probably have an intolerance to extreme cold and heat.,
he also looked at my gums and inner mouth.,
"he said as i don't feel dizzy, faint or have any pains in the chest, thumping, missing beats or palpatations it's a positive sign it's not serious.",
"anyway, i am going to path lab tomorrow as hba1c due, also run a raft of tests to check for anaemia, check my thyroid function, liver function and kidney function due to the statin, see how my cholesterol is doing.",
"am feeling better about it, wait and see!!",
he also said if people keep on about it its no wonder i am anxious and that anxiety exacerbates the whole thing.,
"thanks for your support, much appreciated.",
am usually a positive person but lately i am rather anxious generally.,
"regards chrissie re: blue lips good news hi sid, blood tests all came back fine, gp put it down to me not feeling well and a drop in bp, i am very fair skinned so she says that would give blueish appearance when i feel poorly as i tend to lose all my colour.",
"good news on hbaic as well, down to 6.8 so she says thats within nice guideines.",
"thanks for your concern, chrissie",
"i'm type ii diabetic, been diagnosed a year.",
i understand from my diabetic nurse if you get a sore or an injury that doesnt heal you should go see your gp.,
i didnt ask what would be the recommended amount of time an injury/sore should heal.,
anybody have any ideas?,
"thankyou all before diabetes i'd heal quickly, in a matter of days.",
however the injury i have now has persisted for weeks so was just curious.,
i did try to see my gp about it.,
"my appointment was 2pm, hadnt been seen at 2.45pm and had to go as had other things to do that day.",
have tried to get another appointment but surgery is full up every time i try.,
if it persists i'll give them a call when i'm back from my break away thanks for your replies,
hello!,
im a newbie here and have spent about two months just reading everyones inspirational stories and adapting it to my life.,
i have reduced my carb intake and upped my physical activity.,
i have a lot of weight to loose at least 40kg.,
i found that 90% of the success stories on here are based on very low carb like less than 50g a day.,
"for me, that is just not feasible, it will affect my quality of life.",
"i dont have a sweet tooth, i can cut out all desert, chocs and sugary drinks.",
"but bread and rice are a staple in my diet, i cant see a life without it.",
"(i like to be realistic) well my main question here is, is there any chance of me reversing or controlling my disease with these little changes im making e.g.",
staying under 100150g of carbs daily?,
is there anyone that has done it?,
ickihun said: before i knew about low carbing tool i reversed my undiagnosed diabetes.,
of course i cannot prove it but not everything in life can be proved.,
hence all the research and data collected along the way.,
eating just enough to feed my young healthy body and exercising 10hrs per week was successful but i had more weight loss on 600cal milkshakes in the mid 80s.,
click to expand...,
thank you so much for reply!,
means so much as i thought no one would bother!,
"can i ask, would you attribute it to your successful weight loss?",
how do you get on these days?,
is your diabetes still reversed/controlled and what are you doing to maintain in the day to day?,
"there is no spoon said: hi kick, as long as your not crazy and having rice sandwiches breakfast lunch and dinner, it shouldn't be too much of a problem.",
for some people they are so carb sensitive they have to cut out bread and rice.,
check your results with a glucose meter and if t doesn't spike you then you shouldn't have to cut them out of your diet altogether just use some common sense and eat them less often.,
click to expand...,
thank you for your reply!,
yes... ive bought a meter just too scared to poke/see the reading.,
i know i really should.,
"will take your advice ziggy_w said: hello @heathkick2017 , some members have also successfully gone through the newcastle diet, which has helped them to reverse their diabetes.",
it involves having 800 cals a day for eight weeks.,
"i am tagging @pipp and @fleegle , who have some experience with this diet.",
i definitely would like to encourage you to become proactive about your diabetes.,
it is so worth it.,
you will find that you feel so much better.,
"personally, i have adopted the low-carb way of life, which has worked for me.",
"i've been living this way now for 3 years and it took some time to find a replacement for some of the foods, but it can be done and i honestly don't feel deprived.",
my hubby even calls this a luxury diet.,
have you had a look at the website dietdoctor.com?,
they have lots of great recipes and you can access them for free without signing up for the website.,
"for example, i make the keto bread from the website to replace bread.",
rice can be replaced with cauliflower rice.,
"there also low carb cakes, such as brownies, cheesecake and carrot cake.",
"you might also want to have a look at the ""what have you eaten today?""",
thread in the low-carb forum to get some ideas what types of foods you can eat.,
click to expand...,
i had never heard of dietdoctor but thank you!,
i will check it out today.,
i will also try to make the keto bread.,
"elsewhere on the forum they talk about lidl protein roll, are these any good, carb content wise?",
mbaker said: i am not sure it is possible for a type 2 to reverse on up to 150 grams of carbs especially rice.,
"i managed a 41 hba1c on low gi, which included soda bread, oats and sweet potato.",
this required a lot of exercise.,
switching to lchf yielded much better results.,
"to loose the 40 kg, optimally you will need to keep blood glucose / insulin low, this will be hard with high carbs coming in, unless you go low calorie, which drops your metabolic rate, which means either need more exercise and reduced food amounts by about 25 %.",
"you could try low carb bread, such as livlife and there is a polish low carb bread that has been mentioned recently.",
rice i think is around 33% carbs per 100 grams with just 1 gram of fibre and high glucose / insulin response for many - you will have to test.,
"you could try the cooking with coconut oil, cooling, refrigerating, reheating trick, which lowers the impact of the starch in rice.",
"you might have a chance on a whole food plant based diet as this protocol included rice, but not much is said about this on this forum.",
i used to feel the same about oats; but better glucose control in my back to back tests mean i have long forgotten about these.,
click to expand...,
thank you!,
that explains why i have such a hard time loosing weight.,
perhaps ill drop my carbs to 100g a day.,
and eat rice only on some days of the week as opposed to my previous lifestyle of pretty much twice a day everyday.,
i really think it was my inactivity that caused the weight gain/diabetes i barely left my house for two years i was a full time couch potato.,
im hoping with upping my physical activity to 3x a week 1hr cardio.,
3x a week 45mins resistance training which ive been doing i can reduce my insulin resistance.,
ive managed to loose about 3 inches of my waist but then again its taken almost 4 months!,
"thanks for your suggestion on the rice i usually cook it in tomato sauce, so ill try adding coconut oil!",
mts1980 said: yes i have but at least 8km walk every day is a must i use few unconventional things too in my diet it is possible buddy click to expand...,
thank you for sharing how you do it!,
i will up my physical activity.,
hopefully that will help my burn the carbs i take in thanks for all your responses.,
i also do if fasting 18hrs a day eating 6hrs and i take some supplements such as chromium and apple cider vinegar.,
anyone else familiar with these or if?,
"hi guys, i recently found a wart on my right pointing finger, so today i bought some bazuka gel i applied it to my finger then read that it was not suitable for diabetes, can anyone tell me why and if i should stop using it ?",
tia xx,
i am type 2 diabetic and am suffering from high sugars at night (between 9 and 15) but they are normal in the mornings (between 4 and 7).,
i already use levemir (a slow release insulin) twice a day taking 42 units in the morning (recently increased from 38 but with no effect on my evening sugars) and 12 units at night and have been using this for about 4 years with a slowly increasing dosage rate - four years ago when i started on levemir i was taking 12 units in the morning only.,
i also take metformin and forxigra.,
my weight is the lowest it has been in the last 20 years (71kg) and i am 5ft 6 inches in height.,
i eat sugar free cereal in the morning a normal lunch and an early light supper (around 7pm) which is usually fish or cold meat and salad.,
i almost never snack between meals.,
i have had relatively good control for the last year or so and only in the last 3 months have my evening sugars gone out of control and i can think of nothing at all which i am doing differently.,
has anyone any advise or suggestions to offer.,
grantgam said: your basal dose seems quite imbalanced in terms of the majority of insulin dependant diabetics.,
"usually we take an even split of levemir, or in a lot of cases - more insulin for the night time period rather than the day time.",
"this is due to the body requiring more basal insulin during sleep, where we are both inactive and also fasting.",
exactly what time in the evening is your bg high?,
is it the wee hours when you're usually sleeping?,
click to expand...,
i test in the morning when i wake (usually about 8am) and inject then and test at night before going to bed (usually around 11pm) and then inject.,
so my sugars are high at 11pm and low at 8am.,
i started on 12 units of levemir in the mornings only but as i have had increasing difficulties in controlling evening sugars it was suggested that i split my doasges and have been slowly increasing my morning dosage ever since because of my evening difficulties.,
over the last 4 years i have had good control and ir is only in the last 6 months that i have lost the ability to control my evening levels even with higher morning levemir dosages.,
is this good?,
do you think i will need medication??,
i realise there are no doctors etc but would just like a general opnion.,
am getting readings of 12.6 after meals so dont really understand how it quite works!!!!,

i do have yogurt but i have to limit my protein intake for now.,
hopefully my next results will paint a less scary picture.,
ickihun said: definitely ask the pharmacist.,
they will know straight away.,
i've used sugar free candyrock but only because i know it loosens things up but only as a one off.,
constant constipation should be mentioned to a medic for long term help.,
i know i've gone from loose tummy on metformin to no metformin to xl metformin to constipation with co-codamol but spacing them out more helps.,
water also relieves any constipation my 9yr old ever gets but not sure whether a long term solution.,
click to expand...,
"yes, my husband was suggesting that i talk to the ever-so-polite (not) pharmacist at our health clinic pharmacy.",
i have been on metformin and have been though plenty of loose tummy moments.,
when i started these medications in aug this year (in addition to the metformin) i was still experiencing them.,
just wondering if the bp medications and jardiance are adding to the problem.,
daisyduck said: psyillium husk works perfectly for me.,

so vitamin c or psyillium husk seems to be the answer.,

called the pharmacist today who said to try senocot?,
do you wear a diabetes id bracelet?,
"this is one for t2s, really.",
"i understand totally the rationale of id bracelets for t1s recently, my sister would have died if she hadnt had one.",
for t2s they seem to be treated as more optional.,
but should those of us on meds that leave us prone to the odd hypo wear them?,
"the sensible answer is yes, i know, but this is where attitudes to the condition come in.",
"my diabetes is under control, i accept the very real and bothersome daily limitations it imposes on me, i realise the dangers of complications and try to act accordingly.",
"i have primed my boss and 1st-aid people in my workplace, i have stashes of jelly babies everywhere, i have a mental map of where in my daily routine i can crash out if i need to.",
i even have an insulin kit to hand for when/if my pancreas gives out (as my consultant demanded).,
but while i live with the condition i am emphatically not prepared to let it define me (and that is precisely why i feel i can live with it).,
wearing an id is branding myself with the condition and i have an instinctive and elemental distaste for it.,
"of course i am a signed-up member of the diabetic community, and this forum is a wonderful support network, but getting an id bracelet would feel like giving in, not so much accepting my condition as embracing it.",
i know this sounds stupid and irrational but are there any more stupid and irrational people like me out there?,
"thank you, wise people.",
i'm sure you're right that a discreet diabetes card in a wallet makes most sense - wil help me to think of diabetes more like a membership card/ credit card (or maybe a loyalty card -- there's a thought).,
"catherinecherub -- you're right i'm sort of 1.5-they-don't-really-know, but i usually find it easier to say t2 rather than trying to explain.",
there's t1 in the family -- hence people prodding me to have proper id.,
sarah -- everyday limitations i suppose relate to the job.,
"lots of stress, running round, long meetings, giving talks, and yet trying to make sure i exercise after lunch, and that i eat the right things -- enough to keep sugars down but not so little carb that i have hypo.",
"it sounds pathetic but it's a daily balancing act, as stress makes sugar levels very difficult to predict, and can't afford pre-hypo vagueness or irritability if i'm lecturing or conducting a job interview.",
there have been some hilarious near-misses -- i will try to start an 'embarrassing hypos' thread some time (i actually had a borderline hypo when appearing on bbc1 recently -- would that have been a diabetic first?,
).,
hello i have dry and cracked skin on my feet.,
i had a fear of diabetes type 2 a couple of years ago as was having blurred vision and one low sugar reading.,
however it seems it was more to do with anxiety.,
however i have had the blurred vision return and have cracked skin on my feet.,
i have read it can be to do with diabetes.,
"i have no other symptoms however such as thirst, tiredness, tingling in hands thrush, i am not overweight.",
have occasional urgency to pass urine but not frequent which i put down to age although it seems it is also anxiety as i can sense the tension around the lower areas and if i relax it often goes.,
i have read that cracked skin can be caused by faulty nerve transmission blocking oil production on the feet.,
if this happens would there be any other sensations in the feet or legs.,
i have no other sensations.,
if this is a part of diabetes at what stage would someone be likely to experience dry and cracked feet .,
thank you and thanks for all the help and support you give to people.,
thanks thanks for all you replies,
my partner (type 2) was started on insulin back in february and is currently on novomix 30 taking 28 units in the morning and 28 units before evening meal.,
"in the morning he also takes 500mg metformin (x 2) and gliclazide 80mg .plus the same dose with evening medication other medication is also taken for high blood pressure (felodipine, ramipril, bendroflumethiazide, doxazosin) and for neuropathic pain (duloxetine) yesterday the diabetic nurse suggested starting him on a new medication for diabetesunfortunately i was not at appointment and he couldnt remember name but from description given i suspect this is forxiga (dapagliflozin) just wondered if anyone else is on a similar cocktail of medication for type 2 diabetes.my concerns i guess are that it seems a lot of different medications all trying to do a similar job and it will be difficult to know which ones are being effectiveand which ones are perhaps acting against others and having unwanted side effects..",
"i would have thought that moving on to insulin would have meant less other diabetic oral medication but it seems the health professionals are just adding in more and more .i assume they know what they are doing are there any questions that i (or he) should be asking lessci said: i'm on metformin, sitagliptin and forxiga, was on gliclizide but caused weight gain and i'm already carrying extra weight.",
"i'd be concerned at staying on the gliclizide and forxiga as they both can cause hypos, and with the insulin as well.... just keep a close eye on their bg levels click to expand... @lessci ...thank you for your reply...",
he has not been started on the forxiga yet but assume that when he does he will drop the gliclazide...he also carries extra weight and has in fact put on a stone since starting the insulin....i assume from reading that this is a known side effect of insulin.,
when he started on the insulin he was told to drop the gliclazide but this has since been added back into the mix though at a lesser dose than the maximum he was on before.....am not sure what the reasoning was behind this move.,
"my assumption is that the forxiga is being offered as an alternative to the gliclazide to combat the increase in weight....i do have concerns about the possibility of hypos which i have discussed elsewhere and hope that this new medication (if offered) doesn't cause too many problems in that respect... indy51 said: unfortunately, unless or until your partner decides to take his own diabetes and diet seriously, this is probably the path he will be following to the end.",
medications can only do so much without the patient being willing to adapt and make lifestyle changes.,
and each added medication will bring its own share of side effects.,
"i still think the best thing you could do is sit him down and make him read kman's thread ""terminal and scared"" because that's the path he's on.",
click to expand... @indy51 ...thank you for your reply.... as an update my partner is taking his diabetes and diet far more seriously compared to six months ago and has made considerable progress in looking at what he is eating and trying to eat the right things / not eat the wrong things....he now looks at the carb content of food when purchasing and is much more aware of what he eats....he has recently taking to eating more salad and has virtually given up potatoes and bread...i only cook potatoes for myself now......he doesn't drink alcohol and has given up fizzy drinks....all he drinks is water and a daily cup of coffee...there are still a few poor food choices that he knows he shouldn't be having (at least he recognises this) but on the whole i would say that it is much improved... @andbreathe since starting on the insulin bs levels have come down from the high teens he had before....morning levels are generally under 10...evening levels are still in the low to mid teens...but lower than previously... activity levels are unchanged and is as before...relatively inactive ....but other than that i do feel that some progress is being made...,
i do still feel that the cocktail of medication is not necessarily helping as it is difficult to identify which bits are working and which are not....perhaps naively i thought that starting on insulin would mean less oral diabetic medication but this doesn't seem to be the case... molly56 said: my partner (type 2) was started on insulin back in february and is currently on novomix 30 taking 28 units in the morning and 28 units before evening meal.,

my mum is hypertensive but she's ok on indapamide..not a criticism and i don't know your story and i know that not everyone is the same but i was just interested as to why he is on 4 meds for bp?,
click to expand... @servewithmintsauce ...i think he did have the indapamide at one point but had a strange reaction to it within a few days of starting on it....including quite vivid hallucinations and ending up in hospital....cannot be convinced it was the medication but is now one that i would suggest he avoids as don't want a repeat episode.....was all very odd and was perhaps more worrying for me being the person on the outside looking in....,
hi everyone!!,
"i'm new to this forum but it is just what i need.....to talk to people who know their stuff i have been having trouble with my doctors, they are being very dismissive about the symptoms i have been experiencing.",
"i am not diabetic, that has been established using blood tests at the doctors and doing my own at-home blood glucose testing.",
"i went to the doctors with diabetic symptoms, almost all of the main ones, very frequent urination, extreme fatigue, all of a sudden becoming weak and shaky and all of a sudden extreme hunger.",
if i happened to eat chocolate in the afternoon within 3 hours i would have an almighty headache.,
all of my symptoms seems to revolve around food.,
my home blood glucose testing showed my postprandial level was lower than my preprandial level.,
i tested over 3 days and the results were the same.,
my fasting glucose in the morning was always fine.,
after my doctor got my results from their glucose testing i was told my blood glucose was low but not in the dangerous zone.,
i have never had strips and my tester with me when i have had a hypo-like spell so i have not yet managed to get a reading when my symptoms are at their worst.,
my doctors have put my symptoms down to a vitamin d deficiency.......,
i have been paying closer attention to what i'm eating and how my body reacts.,
always within 3 hours of eating i am incredibly fatigued and/or have hypo-like symptoms and have needed to pee 5-6 times.,
my doctor is refusing to acknowledge the existence of reactive hypoglycemia.,
does any of this sound like that may be what is going on?,
"anyone's help and advice would be so appreciated, feel like i'm getting nowhere with the doctors and it's starting to get in the way of my normal life now.",
"oh and i should probably mention i am a healthy weight for my height, i exercise regularly and eat a very good diet, i am definitely eating enough.",
"thanks for reading andbreathe said: to be honest you need to capture some readings when you feel off, or any comment is just that, and probably meaningless.",
"as you are describing that you can almost create a scenario where you have these uncomfortable feelings, you should be able to get some readings.",
all you have to do is carry your testing kit with you for a few days and you'll be there.,
"how often have these occurrences happened, on average?",
click to expand... that is what i was thinking of doing as it's really the only way i will see how low it goes isn't it?,
thanks for replying so quick!!,
"i have the extreme postprandial fatigue every day, the frequent urination every day and i'd say around 3-4 hypo-like episodes a week.",
some weeks it's more.,
brunneria said: thanks kat click to expand...,
thanks!!,
"i've been having a peek at your posts, i saw you had requested a rh section.",
good idea.,
what was your experience with being diagnosed with rh?,
was it a struggle for you?,
my doctor basically said i have low blood glucose readings but they aren't going to do anything further because my readings aren't low or high enough to be diabetic.,
she said it's just my body telling me i need to eat but i'm getting these symptoms usually 2-2.5 hours after eating.,
i shouldn't be ravenous after such a short time i would think.,
i'm pretty much hungry all the time even though i am eating plenty.,
i think my doctor thinks it's just a slight feeling of hunger i'm getting but that isn't what it is.,
i feel completely drained out of nowhere like i haven't eaten for days.,
"it feels like my food is going nowhere, it's not fueling my body, it's causing these symptoms.",
that's how i feel about it.,
then after i do eat im knocked out with an overwhelming fatigue that i can't fight.,
i just need to sleep.,
i sleep plenty at night and i always sleep right through.,
"brunneria said: hi emma, and welcome!",
"there are a few of us on the forum with experience of rh, so you may find a few of your answers on here.",
"have a look at this thread, and see if any of the info fits... http://www.diabetes.co.uk/forum/thr...orum-section-on-reactive-hypoglycaemia.65454/ i agree with the suggestions people have made that you need to capture a few blood glucose readings during your symptoms.",
"but in the meantime, here are a few suggestions.",
"frequent excessive urination is a symptom of high blood glucose (usually over 10mmol/l) so, if your blood glucose is going that high, at any point in the day, you need to know when.",
"usually, our bg shoots up after a carby meal, reaching a peak at around 45-75 mins after starting to eat.",
then it falls away.,
"this is why we test at 2 hours - the peak is past, and we can see if there are any lingering problems as the peak subsides.",
"how about you do a few tests after typical meals, every 15 or 30 mins, and see how high you are going up.",
"map the readings all the way until your bg has returned to its pre-meal figure, even if that takes several hours.",
i should do the same over the period you usually get your fatigue slump.,
that will map things out nicely.,
have you got an app for your phone where you can plot your meter readings on a graph?,
"well worth getting, if you haven't.",
this kind of information is never available to doctors.,
"they just run the standard range of bg tests, and lose interest if your numbers don't flag up within their easily identified worry-zone.",
we have a member on here ( @nosher8355 ) who fought and fought with his gp to be referred.,
"he was eventually sent to a hospital clinic where they ran 72 hour fasting tests, and extended oral glucose tolerance tests.",
these are the only things that will identify rh in a way that the nhs will acknowledge - and it is terribly difficult to get that clinic referral in the first place!,
"one thing that crosses my mind, is your fatigue.",
i wonder if at least part of your symptoms may be a food intolerance.,
i get extreme fatigue after wheat.,
"yawning, sleepy, barely able to keep my eyes open... happens about 2-3 hours after bread.",
or pasta.,
"if you have a similar thing, then your blood glucose monitor will help to identify that very very quickly.",
"as soon as you start to yawn and need to snooze, whip out the testing kit.",
"if your bg is showing your normal range of numbers, and is not unusually low, then this may be an explanation.",
but please do have a look at the link i posted above.,
"and join us on that thread, if you like.",
"the more, the merrier!",
click to expand... that's all brilliant info.,
"thanks so much, i don't have an app but i will get one.",
there's an app for everything!!,
ha ha.,
i have trouble finding what readings are normal and what aren't.,
will my readings be in the diabetic range if i am having a proper hypo when i test myself when i have the hypo-like symptoms?,
"i am going to get strips tomorrow and start doing it asap, if my doctors won't help i suppose it's down to me to test myself.",
i will also read that link you posted.,
"again, thanks to everyone who has replied!!",
i hope i get some answers soon.,
brunneria said: i was never diagnosed.,
i first came across a book about hypoglycaemia when i was about 17 - and it described me perfectly.,
"and that is what started me on the low carbing - been doing that, gradually more and more strictly, for about 30 years now.",
"i went through periods of inhaling carbs, rh symptoms and weight gain, and periods of strict low carb, stable weight, and blissfully rh free.",
"tried to ask for help from several doctors, over the years, but none of them even believed my symptoms were real.",
"i was offered sleeping tablets, antidepressents and anti-anxiety meds, at various times.",
thank goodness i refused each time!,
"eventually, all the over-use of my insulin producing capacity seemed to move me into pre-diabetes, then type 2 diabetes.",
"for a while i had both - raised bg from insulin deficiency, followed by too low bg from the insulin driving it down too far.",
"thank fully, low carbing has knocked that on the head.",
"but it is only in the last year, with my blood glucose meter, and all the information about low carbing that is available from members of this forum, that i have hammered my rh into submission, and i could easily see it returning, if i mess with carbs too much.",
click to expand...,
so you are type 2 now?,
well it seems with the quality of doctors i have in my town i won't be getting referred any time soon.,
they are notoriously rubbish.,
i have ulcerative colitis and they were happy to leave a 20 year old unable to eat properly for 9 weeks.,
they said it was a bug and kept turning me away.,
i eventually had to go to a completely different practice where a young doctor recognised what it was straight away.,
"brunneria said: here is a link to the main part of this site, giving 'normal' blood glucose ranges.",
http://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes_care/blood-sugar-level-ranges.html it is well worth a read.,
"the whole site is, actually.",
but i would take the nhs blood glucose guidlines with a teensy pinch of salt.,
they are based on averages.,
"and you, and i are unique.",
click to expand...,
i'll have a read of that too.,
thanks!,
i always thought the nhs guideline numbers might be a bit off am i right in thinking it isn't normal for bg to regularly be lower 2 hours after eating?,
brunneria said: regularly lower than what?,
click to expand... oh sorry!,
should have made that clearer.,
lower than just before eating.,
"brunneria said: ah, yes, i see.",
"have a look at this link - please note, i am not suggesting you conduct a glucose tolerance test on yourself, without medical supervision!",
but the results on the graph are a good indication of typical results for different types of glucose intolerance.,
"http://rajeun.net/gtt.html to translate the blood glucose readings into english units, divide by 18 click to expand...",
this is the kind of information i've been looking for!,
you're a star!!!!!!!,
thank you!,
nosher8355 said: hi sorry just in!,
"the fasting reading is always interesting for diagnosis, as normal bsls are recorded.",
one of the ways that i get my bsls down is by fasting until i get back to normal levels.,
i agree with @brunneria you need to record everything.,
you also need to eat frequently every 2-3 hours if you want to be in control.,
small snacks rather than meals.,
"keep to your low carb intake, as you probably like me are carb and sugar intolerant.",
read the threads about my experiences and i have also read a lot on hypoglycaemia at wikipedia.,
the nhs site is shockingly short of information.,
"also when you do hypo, do not use hi carbs or sugars to ease the symptoms, it doesn't work!",
"have a cuppa and a low carb small snack, then you won't hyper then hypo again.",
let us know how you are getting on.,
"click to expand... hi, nice to hear from you.",
thanks for the info.,
all very useful.,
"my fasting bgs were normal before, although i only did it over 2 or 3 days.",
i ran out of strips so there are some gaps.,
i think taking more throughout the day would be a good idea.,
i will let you know what i come up with.,
a cuppa is usually what i have when i go wobbly.,
it tends to work.,
i will also try eating every 2 hours to stave them off.,
so are you properly diagnosed with rh now?,
is it ok for diabetics to wear flight socks?,
"i'm very active, think my feet / legs are generally in good working order!",
"last year i was getting quite a lot of tingling in my feet and legs for a few months & my nurse briefly said ""oh it could be the start of neuropathy nothing you can do about that"" but i haven't had it since then, and at my feet checkups they're always pleased because i can feel everything fine and there's no numbness.",
i'm going for an 11 hour flight so was just going to grab some but noticed some warnings on the back of boxes saying they're unsuitable and i wanted to check with everyone first - i assumed they'd only be an issue for people with very poor circulation?,
"not sure that this is the right place to ask this, but why have those of us who prefer not to have avatars, or who don't know how to do them, had avatars inflicted upon us?",

"christmas is almost upon us and the cupboards are still bare, i need to get some shopping done including christmas fare.",
the problem is what do i get as a diabetic i now am.,
i could get a chicken or 3 bird roast or even a joint of ham?,
"question ------------ what does everybody else have for a christmas dinner, and what would be a good alternative to roast potatoes?",
brunneria said: the last two years we have had huge slabs of good quality steak from our local butcher.,
"with green salad, fried onions and stilton crumbled over.",
about 15 mins in kitchen.,
we have loved it so much we are considering doing it again.,
then my 15g carb/meal can be spent on half a mince pie.,
with a lot of extra thick double cream.,
click to expand... after eating all that dare i ask what you were doing in the kitchen for 15 minutes that makes you want to do it again this year.,
"the mind boggles nosher8355 said: just cook the bird, eat it with vegetables, (not spuds etc) and enjoy!",
i'm gonna save up my allowance of low carbs for something special later!,
why does everyone think that they have to have roasties for christmas dinner?,
"click to expand... like robbity says, ""it's tradition"", the done thing, we've been brainwashed into thinking that's what christmas dinner is.",
"personally i think that the roast potatoes were just a baking tray filler, just plonked around the joint or bird to soak up some of the juices.",
"i must admit though, i do like roasties.",
"tim2000s said: as a t1, i'm going insulate accordingly and eat whatever i want!",

alliebee said: i'm going to have a day off on christmas day and eat more or less what i want and yes this will include roasties and stuffing.,
not got a sweet tooth so cheese for afters i guess and will leave mince pies alone.,
maybe raspberries and whisky laced cream click to expand...,
if truth be known i think 95% of the members on here are either thinking the same thing or have already made their minds up to do exactly the same.,
at the end of the day there's always next year to get those bs readings down again.,
douglas99 said: a good christmas for me.,

i'll include myself in that.,

i'll probably be that pi**ed i'll use my tester to see if the chickens at the right temperature.,
"what do you reckon, about 9.6?",
"hi, i was diagnosed with type 2 about 6 months ago and nothing much has happened with it other than about 6 weeks ago they put me on one a day 500mg metformin following a recent hba1c.",
anyways they never told me to check my blood glucose level with any meter or urine for that matter so i though everything was hunk dory nothing to worry about i was doing fine.,
out of curiosity just for my own piece of mind and to see how i was doing i got some urine testing strips and they were showing fine results even after i started the metformin.,
but over the past couple of weeks i've tested my urine about an hour and half after food and the strip goes a very dark color after 30 seconds.,
i put the strip against the container color chart and there are 3 +++'s and after 40 seconds its as dark and the indicator for 4 ++++'s .,
now being new to all of this and not being told i should test can anyone tell me if these results on the testing strips are something to worry about?,
i'm not due to go back to the dr's for a test or check up until mid january.,
the last time i went to another doc about my high blood pressure medication and not feeling well and mentioned if it had anything to do with my type 2 she as much as said you have nothing to worry about yours is diet controlled and was very stroppy with me like i was wasting her time.,
so naturally i'm a little wary of going back and asking about this urine thing.,
can anyone offer any reassurance all is ok?,
my first post here sorry its a long one lol johnegreen said: if you are concerned about your health it is never a waste of time consulting your doctor and i would suggest you do just that.,
yes urine test strips are a crude measure when compared to a glucose meter but if the strips where not faulty and used properly they are a reasonable indicator of high bg levels normally.,
and i would personally if i where you go see your doctor and raise your concerns with him/her.,
sooner than later.,

"thank you john jay-marc said: if you are detecting sugar in your urine this will typically indicate blood sugar in excess of 10 mmol/l which is higher than the levels you should be that time after eating, suggesting action of some kind needs to be taken.",
"but as said above, get yourself a blood glucose testing kit to get a better idea of how you are at present.",
what is your typical diet?,
"click to expand... hi thank you, as far a diet is concerned then i have reduced my carb intake as well a sugar, not that i had a lot of sugar stuff other than i like choccy bickies and now cut them out.",
"i guess i need to look at my diet again daisy1 said: @johnjoe13 hello and welcome to the forum as mentioned above, here is the basic information we give to new members and i hope you will find it useful and helps you with some of your problems.",
ask as many questions as you want and someone will be able to help.,
basic information for new members diabetes is the general term to describe people who have blood that is sweeter than normal.,
a number of different types of diabetes exist.,
a diagnosis of diabetes tends to be a big shock for most of us.,
"its far from the end of the world though and on this forum you'll find well over 220,000 people who are demonstrating this.",
"on the forum we have found that with the number of new people being diagnosed with diabetes each day, sometimes the nhs is not being able to give all the advice it would perhaps like to deliver - particularly with regards to people with type 2 diabetes.",
the role of carbohydrate carbohydrates are a factor in diabetes because they ultimately break down into sugar (glucose) within our blood.,
"we then need enough insulin to either convert the blood sugar into energy for our body, or to store the blood sugar as body fat.",
"if the amount of carbohydrate we take in is more than our bodys own (or injected) insulin can cope with, then our blood sugar will rise.",
"the bad news research indicates that raised blood sugar levels over a period of years can lead to organ damage, commonly referred to as diabetic complications .",
the good news people on the forum here have shown that there is plenty of opportunity to keep blood sugar levels from going too high.,
its a daily task but its within our reach and its well worth the effort.,
"controlling your carbs the info below is primarily aimed at people with type 2 diabetes, however, it may also be of benefit for other types of diabetes as well.",
there are two approaches to controlling your carbs: reduce your carbohydrate intake choose better carbohydrates reduce your carbohydrates a large number of people on this forum have chosen to reduce the amount of carbohydrates they eat as they have found this to be an effective way of improving (lowering) their blood sugar levels.,
"the carbohydrates which tend to have the most pronounced effect on blood sugar levels tend to be starchy carbohydrates such as rice, pasta, bread, potatoes and similar root vegetables, flour based products (pastry, cakes, biscuits, battered food etc) and certain fruits.",
choosing better carbohydrates the low glycaemic index diet is often favoured by healthcare professionals but some people with diabetes find that low gi does not help their blood sugar enough and may wish to cut out these foods altogether.,
read more on carbohydrates and diabetes .,
"over 145,000 people have taken part in the low carb program - a free 10 week structured education course that is helping people lose weight and reduce medication dependency by explaining the science behind carbs, insulin and gi.",
eating what works for you different people respond differently to different types of food.,
what works for one person may not work so well for another.,
the best way to see which foods are working for you is to test your blood sugar with a glucose meter.,
to be able to see what effect a particular type of food or meal has on your blood sugar is to do a test before the meal and then test after the meal.,
a test 2 hours after the meal gives a good idea of how your body has reacted to the meal.,
"the blood sugar ranges recommended by nice are as follows: blood glucose ranges for type 2 diabetes before meals: 4 to 7 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 8.5 mmol/l blood glucose ranges for type 1 diabetes (adults) before meals: 4 to 7 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 9 mmol/l blood glucose ranges for type 1 diabetes (children) before meals: 4 to 8 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 10 mmol/l however, those that are able to, may wish to keep blood sugar levels below the nice after meal targets.",
"access to blood glucose test strips the nice guidelines suggest that people newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes should be offered: structured education to every person and/or their carer at and around the time of diagnosis, with annual reinforcement and review self-monitoring of plasma glucose to a person newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes only as an integral part of his or her self-management education therefore both structured education and self-monitoring of blood glucose should be offered to people with type 2 diabetes.",

note: this post has been edited from sue/ken's post to include up to date information.,
"click to expand... hi daisy thank you for this information i've found it very useful indeed salvia said: hello @johnjoe13 , and welcome to the forum.",
"from the info you give, it seems that you've been given a diagnosis and then left to your own devices.",
"have you been given any guidances about what you should do to help yourself - particularly diet, exercise, that could help you to reduce your blood sugar levels?",
"have they told you what the hba1c number was when you were diagnosed, and also what the latest re-test result was that led to you being put on metformin?",
"if not, then you should ask for the details, so that you know where you are starting from.",
"you have a right to know this info, so phone your practice and ask them to provide you with a print-out of your blood test results - all the results, not just the hba1c - (or if not a print-out, at the very least to tell you the info) i agree with the others, that you should raise any concerns with your gp, coz they will know your full history.",
"try not to be put off by gp off-hand manner, or veiled aggression, you have the right to know; perhaps try a different gp next time.",
"it is not likely that your gp or the diabetes nurse will tell you to test blood sugars, because they will not provide the equipment for patients to test at home, except for those on insulin.",
"but many of us here do test, though, (and don't tell our gp ) because if we don't know what our bs levels are doing, how can we possibly hope to manage them.",
"so, if you decide to test for yourself, you'll probably need to purchase your own meter and the test strips.",
"many here use the sd codefree because that one has the cheapest testing strips, which is the ongoing expense.",
the meter can be purchased from home-health.uk.com or from amazon.,
you'll need to specify mmol/l as this is the measurement used in the uk.,
"lastly, i'll tag @daisy1 for you, who will provide a new joiner's information pack.",
i'd encourage you to read through this and take on board the advice and the links to further info.,
"this will help you a lot with getting to grips with things, and understanding what's going on with your body.",
"there's also a link to the free 10-week low carb diet starter course, which i think you would find very useful.",
think i've rambled on long enough - i'll shut up now!,
"good luck, and if there's any further questions, just ask away, there's usually someone around who can help.",
"ps have just picked up this info from @liam1955 on another thread, relating to purchase of additional testing strips direct from homehealth-uk.com: if you buy in bulk here are the discount code numbers.",
5 packs = 264086.,
10 packs = 975833.,
for the uk we use mmol/l and remember to state you are diabetic for vat exemption.,
and delivery is very quick too.,
"click to expand... wow thank you, i get home from work and check to see if anybody has answered my question and see such wonderful responses.",
in truth i did attend a one day seminar called desmond at my local hospital and this was very useful and i have done a lot they suggested and cut down on carbs and what bit of additional sugar i was taking.,
clearly i need to do much more on the carbs.,
"the thing i was not told to do was check glucose levels to see if i was doing stuff properly or more aggressively, but how would i know this if nobody showed me how to test or told me i should do some testing at all.",
then when i do end up doing it myself and notice a change i find myself no knowing how to understand what results i'm getting i've taken your advise on the info from liam1955 and just ordered a tester from homehealth along with the 5 extra strips packs and the discount code.,
i'm going to read up on what i should be doing with these testers and make a further cut to these carbs and noting it all down so hopefully the recent rise in glucose is reversed and my urine goes back to what it was after meals and obviously with much less or no carbs.,
i've also ordered a new exercise bike from argos to give me a much more intense workout on top of what i already do swusa_ said: i agree with all the above posters and just want to add that it is normal for someone with type 2 diabetes to have high blood sugars at 1 and 2 hours after eating.,
that is pretty much the definition of diabetes-our bodies do not deal well with the carbohydrates in the food we eat and we get high blood sugars after eating.,
metformin will help you keep your blood sugar from rising as much but the amount of food and the carbohydrates in the food we eat are also important.,

"thank you swusa, i did reduce my portion sizes on carbs and ate less but now i'm thinking i need to cut more of them out all together.",
but i'm also thinking 'blimmey' it's christmas time what on earth am i going to do over this season with all the wonderful stuff i've always ate?,
"love my turkey and stuffing with all the usual trimmings and creamed mashed potatoes, and yes i've always eaten yorkshire puddings with xmas dinner all covered in thick gravy.",
"i can see this year is not going to be as enjoyable as previous xmas's, or future ones for that matter lessci said: we all react differently to different foods, the best advise i was given here was ""eat to your meter"".",
"test before you eat, then 2 hours after, your bg levels shouldn't be more than 2 points higher if they are your body can't cope with that quantity/type of carb.",
"at first you're testing all the time, but as you get used to what your body can manage it gets less click to expand...",
"thank you, i do think i'm going have to take a fresh look at what i eat.",
"this morning i had a medium banana at 8am, then at 09.30 a small oat so simple cuppa porridge (plain) and that was it, at 11.30 i did a urine test and after 30 seconds the results on the strip was a dark colour dot at 3 xxx, below are what is in it.",
am i to stop eating this stuff now?,
"my dr said porridge is good for lowering my cholesterol which he said i need to do per 100g carbohydrate 66.5g per serving 37g of which sugars 28.3g per serving 15.7g jay-marc said: you may find you can tolerate a moderate amount of potato (i can, although i rarely eat them these days) but you can only find that out from testing.",
"mashed is generally the most difficult, but try mashed celeriac as a substitute.",
"similarly with porridge - some can tolerate it to a degree, others like me can't and ban it and other oatmeal altogether.",
no problem with turkey - keep the skin on.,
bananas are very sweet fruit - switch to berries at least.,
click to expand...,
"thank you jay, when i get my glucose meter i'll be able to test more accurately and find out what foods are causing me a problem, with bananas the dr told me they are a good source of potassium which i need to help with my high blood pressure but i guess i could try other foods rich in this",
"hi, has anyone tried this supposed 'elixir' for lower blood sugar and blood pressure and cholesterol?",
sounds a bit too good to be true bigal,
"i was shaky for 3 hours this afternoon, almost back to normal, is this because of diabetes?",
"still all new to me it has come back again now tonight, just back from swimming",
"i'd be very grateful if someone could offer advice about this - whether they think they know what the cause is, or things to try to see if it gets better.",
neither my gp nor doctors at the hospital could work it out.,
"it's all about dehydration and urination at night, but possibly *not* the usual two suspects for diabetics.",
i think i can rule out high blood sugar levels.,
i did used to get up to pee and drink several times a night when they were well over 10 mmol/l.,
then my levels dropped and i started to get decent sleep again.,
i was on metformin then to help get the numers lower.,
"on one occasion (when the new problem started) i took a bg measurement during the night after peeing and it was a good score for me, about 5 i think.",
then i stopped metformin and tried to get healthy levels the natural way.,
"then something happened which may or may not be relevant: unwittingly, i probably entered fairly deep ketosis.",
i hadn't planned for it and didn't know anything about low-carb dieting and ketosis at the time.,
"i'd just been ""eating to my meter"" and realised that i was extremely carb intolerant.",
"so the carbs went down and down each day, and from memory one day they were less than 20 grams.",
i've researched since then and gather that you expect to pee and drink a lot as you enter ketosis.,
"the thing that i experienced however was that during the day, things were normal.",
"but it seemed like my body went into a very different state whenever i tried to sleep - within an hour or two, i'd be getting up to pee and drink - my mouth felt very dehydrated - lips sticking together, no saliva, couldn't swallow.",
repeat at least every two hours during the night.,
"as soon as i got up for the day, it stopped.",
"i suspected it was the change in diet so i upped the carbs a bit, but not hugely, i can't remember, i'm going to guess about 50-100 grams a day.",
"then it got extremely bad - no exaggeration, waking up and rushing to get water just so i could swallow, peeing, this time with chest pains which may or may not be relevant, trying to get back to sleep and within half an hour doing the same, over and over.",
that day i was in hospital and they checked pretty much everything they check and were not sure what the problem was.,
"one doctor happened to be into ""low carbing"" herself and she suggested that it may be because i had entered ketosis then come out of it, and she said that in leaving ketosis, my body was trying to flush out ketones.",
"she didn't seem at all sure however, and it doesn't explain having practically the same symptoms before leaving ketosis.",
"since then the chest pains have never come back, but i've never had a decent night's sleep.",
"i probably varied between 50 - 150g carbs a day for a while after that, and on many occasions i woke up with a bone dry mouth, and my whole head felt like it was dehydrated, even my eyelids sticking to my eyes!",
"so the general pattern since then has been very disturbed sleep, due to regularly waking up with a very dry head, drinking and peeing.",
recently i upped the carbs largely for this reason and i hoped it would solve this.,
"it does actually seem to have helped, in the last few nights i've just woken up 2-3 times for a pee and water, and i haven't had a scarily dry head - i can just about produce saliva if i try.",
"but i can't keep the carbs at that level, it's just too many to be able to keep my bg numbers healthy, so i'm reducing them again.",
"i'm likely to be low-carbing as a way of life, but if it means i don't get sleep, i'll have to stop again.",
possibly even up the carbs to unhealthy levels and go back on metformin.,
i was getting good sleep on metformin i seem to remember.,
"some possibly relevant info: * the entry into ketosis wasn't planned, i hadn't done the stuff i've since learned, such as taking magnesium, potassium and sodium supplements.",
"* i wasn't educated enough to have consciously tried to up the fats to replace the lack of carbs, all i was consciously doing was reducing the carbs to avoid big spikes.",
no idea what my 'macro ratios' were (and wasn't aware of the term at the time!).,
"* i did once, when trying an 800 calorie diet, use ketostix and found the only time i urinated ketones was during the night, never the day, and there were more ketones in my urine as the night progressed.",
"maybe my body does the whole ketosis thing most strongly at night, whereas most people experience it during the day and are therefore awake and able to keep drinking water and not getting dehydrated?",
* i've tried forcing down 3 litres of water a day.,
makes no difference at all to what happens at night.,
"* i seem to enter mild ketosis at about 110g of carbs, i discovered this when doing the 800-calorie-a-day diet.",
"there are probably all sorts of other relevant things that i haven't mentioned, that's just what comes to mind.",
i'd be very grateful for any suggestions and they may make me remember other relevant stuff.,
"i may be misleading you by focusing on carb amounts, i don't know, but it does seem related.",
thank you.,

robkww said: hi @adamjames - my hba1c is around 32 since diagnosis in 09/16 but i still have to get up in the night to pee and i have a dry mouth which needs quenching 2/3 times a night.,
"as you are, i'm looking for solutions.",
"click to expand... crikey, you've been putting up with this for over a year!?",
"it occurred to me that, forgetting everything about diabetes, lack of sleep is known to be unhealthy for all sorts of reasons.",
ironically glucose control is one.,
this could seriously tempt me to go back on the metformin.,
let's hope we find a solution.,
bulkbiker said: hi guys... sorry but i dont have a clue...,
i used to get up and pee quite a few times in the night when i had high sugars but since ketosis and bs control it happens very rarely for me.,
i used to have bad sleep apnoea which led to dry mouth but again that has gone too.,
feel a bit useless now!,
i cant recall ever having seen anything about it on the ketogenicforums.com either although it might be worth having a look there to see if anyone else has experienced this.,
click to expand...,
"i didn't think it would be an easy one, i remember i trawled the internet to see if anyone had experienced anything similar, i found one post, and no answers!",
add to that 2 gps and 3 doctors.,
"so your level of usefulness is about the same as the entire internet and the medical establishment, no worries there!",
i appreciate you giving it your attention anyhow.,
nosweets said: i had to stop the metformin because it was actually making my diabetes worse possibly due to problems specific to my own body and the reason that i became diabetic suddenly.,
"everybody burns fat ""fat burning"" when they are on reduced calorie diets or have been exercising.",
so it is normal to burn fats at night which is caused by ketosis.,
you are likely to become dehydrated when you are in a state of ketosis so just remember to drink plenty of water.,
i find that i have to force myself to drink 2 to 3 litres of fluids a day as i don't feel so thirsty.,
click to expand...,
"the problem is that, at its worst, i'm pretty sure i was getting through 3 litres just over night so my head didn't turn into a prune.",
"and when i made sure i had 3 litres during the day, this didn't change at all what happened at night.",
"i was actually worried that i was passing so much water through my body that i would be flushing out stuff my body needs like electrolytes, especially if i was going into and out of ketosis.",
"i suspect connecting myself to a drip overnight would solve it, but metformin may be a slightly more practical solution would really like to try to solve this naturally however.",
nosweets said: the amount of water you need depends on your weight and the heavier you are the more you will need-you said that your doctor does not know what is wrong.,
it is normal for diabetics to have these symptoms due to high bg.,
the body tries to remove excess glucose and ketones by peeing as they are poisonous when left hanging around in the blood.,
the reason that ketones are raised at night may be because one does not eat at night and so the body switches over to fat metabolism.,
the cure for the excess thirst and high bg of course is taking insulin or pancreas stimulating drugs or lowering levels by drugs.,
there are alternative methods which are known to lower bg to be found on the internet.,
eg: research shows that apple cider vinegar can lower bg by 20%.,
there are other disorders that may cause your problem such as a urinary tract infection.,
this is what this website says about complications of diabetes.,
"diabetes and nighttime urination, or nocturia, can be a sign of uncontrolled blood sugar levels .",
"this guide to nocturia explains the basics of recognising nocturia, and how to avoid it.",
what is nocturia?,
nocturia is defined as nocturnal urination.,
this means the need to get up in the night to go to the toilet.,
needing to go to the toilet up to once during the night is considered to be normal.,
needing to urinate more than once during the night could indicate a temporary or longer term problem may be present.,
causes of nocturia there are a number of possible causes for needing to urinate more frequently than normal at night and these may include one or more of the following.,
diabetes insipidus high blood glucose levels autonomic neuropathy urinary tract infections cystitis prostate diseases pregnancy excessive fluid intake - particularly alcohol or caffeine intake taking diuretic medications parkinsons disease multiple sclerosis nocturia is more likely to appear as we get older.,

"i've gone through that list and had a read, thank you.",
"none of them *seem* to apply to me, but then it's hard to tell, isn't it.",
so far i seem to be very typical type 2.,
also i'm 99.9% sure it isn't to do with elevated blood sugar levels.,
i know what it's like to keep peeing with elevated blood glucose.,
that gets me day and night almost equally.,
"this particular problem, i've checked, occurs when i'm getting very normal blood sugars.",
"guzzler said: i suffer disturbed sleep not connected with diabetes but it definitely impacts on bg especially fbg, i am on met but still have poor fbg.",
"to add to that, i am on three drugs known to raise bg so all in all a difficult one to sort out.",
the thirst and peeing was not a symptom i was ever really troubled with.,
"click to expand... everything is too complicated, isn't it?",
i've always preferred physics to biology!,
mep said: i get up often during the night and have a dry mouth.,
but i know the reason for both of those.,
"i have a bladder condition, and i have medication that is giving me dry mouth.",
it's a nuisance.,
although if you have something wrong with your bladder you'd probably find you also have other symptoms aside from nocturia.,
have you had your kidneys checked recently?,
that could be another cause.,
i wish you the best.,
click to expand...,
i do actually wonder if it's not diabetes or ketosis-related at all.,
or possibly some damage i did by entering ketosis accidentally and not giving my body what it needed.,
"no i've never had my kidney's checked due to a slight **** up at the gps, but coincidentally i've just a few days ago provided a sample for that very reason.",
this could be interesting!,
kentoldlady1 said: hi.,
just wanted to ask if you are really thirsty or just have a dry mouth?,
my mum was drinking a lot but found she was not making enough saliva.,
now has a spray.,
click to expand...,
"both extremely dry mouth, and very high thirst.",
"i'll always have a mug (about 300ml) of water before going to the toilet, and often have another 300ml afterwards before going back to bed.",
it feels like a combination of genuine thirst plus having a head like a dried prune.,
"or does it mean something else going on ok well i notice that it lowers it abit weird freema said: but how much sugar can a tiny pill contain... cant be many grams click to expand... its lowering my sugar freema said: maybe there is no sugar in the kind you take , and maybe it blocks the liver a bit... jut like alcohol can do it by keeping the liver busy click to expand... ok never heard of that",
"i am told that i do not have glaucoma, retinopathy, cataracts in fact no definitive eye disorder.",
"yet, every day, i suffer from blurred vision to both near and far sight.",
"advice from members has suggested that this may vary according to my blood sugar levels yet i cannot determine this because, on the whole, i have good control.",
from waking my eyes are encrusted and very dry with the worst blurring occurring for at least an hour.,
i often have sore eyes - you know the feeling when hair shampoo gets into the eyes or as if grains of sand have been blown into them.,
vision (testing left and right eyes separately) is frustrating; sometimes i can see captions on the television screen clearly with one eye but not the other or vice versa.,
the same with reading (i wear bi-focals) when sometimes i can read a newspaper clearly and at other times i need a magnifying glass to assist because vision has become out of focus.,
i instinctively feel that i do not have a serious problem because i have moments of clarity in either eye or when reading or looking at a distance.,
my glasses have had their prescription changed recently - the consultation almost drove the technician crazy because i could not make up my mind due to varying levels of clarity or blurredness.,
"without travelling to another country, e.g., singapore, i cannot get the finest specialists to give me an opinion.",
i am a type 2 diabetic and wonder whether we have someone on this forum who knows exactly what i am experiencing and can give me sound advice.,
"dear catherine, thankyou so much for your suggestion - no, nobody has suggested blepharitis.",
the site that you gave will not open at this moment - when it does i will let you know how i get on.,
"regards, rob dear catherine, have read the very informative pages on emedtv - 90% of what is written does seem to apply in my case with the exception of skin and dandruff conditions.",
some 15 months ago i caught an eye infection riding my motorcycle on bali's very dirty roads with unregulated lorry exhausts and it would appear that i have a persistent staff infection from what i read so must continue with anti-viral and the remedial treatments the site suggests.,
one word of caution for others reading this - do not use steroid eye treatment for over 2 weeks it can cause glaucoma!!,
"it was the blurred vision that caused me to post this subject because of my diabetic condition; however, blepharitis does have this as a symtom so i feel more re-assured now.",
thankyou again catherine.,
"regards, rob dear catherine, what with your help re; painkillers and here for blurred vision, i should use you as my gp ha ha ha.",
an update on blepharitis - i am 100% convinced you are right and i am experiencing some relief following remedial guidelines on a number of respected health sites.,
thanks again for this suggestion - i may have had the condition in a minor form for years as i am prone to styes.,
also this may be connected with the illness related to chickenpox (forgotten its name for the moment) which is latent in the body and caused great concern many years ago when the blisters appeared above my eye.,
"dear catherine (and vivien) - ""shingles"" shingles"" shingles"" - there i have not entirely lost it thankgoodness.",
"and to vivien - yes, there is always someone with the same or similar problem - us humans are pretty much the same i think - which is no bad thing.",
i am now getting little more concerned.,
"have accepted that, at the time of original posting, i was suffering from bletharitis (thanks to catherine) i now find myself with very blurred vision from waking lasting for 5 hours or more; sometimes all day.",
my bg on waking is always 6/7 so it is not caused by high sugars which some member experience.,
any of you out there experiencing the same please?,
"dear ju, i am very grateful for your help and information.",
goodness knows what my eye doctor will be able to do about this - her only skills seem to be charging 2.5 times more than other apoteks (chemists).,
as i write this it has been 11 hours and my eyesight is still blurred.,
i will discuss this with my diabetes specialist and ask him to try to locate said equipment.,
i do hope that your fears are unfounded and please let me know how you get on - i will do likewise.,
"with best wishes, rob dear ju, want a laugh??",
i searched google with the term mh's krukenberg's spindle.,
i now realise having read your latest letter to me that you meant your husband ha ha ha.,
no wonder i could find no reference to mh.,
thankyou for the link to the affected eye.,
i have absolutely clear pupil and iris - i have lovely blue eyes ha ha ha - will take this reference to my diabetes specialist so that he can make a general observation even though the equipment is not available.,
i wonder whether the retinopathy test of which i have had three since their inception would show some indications.,
one rule of thumb in the us states that the condition is unlikely in the over 40's.,
as far as an ayurveda (holistic) healing/treatment approach - i am on the right island for this as it is predominantly hindu - i will research this possibility.,
"one afterthought, your husband and i do have one thing in common, i do have a predisposition to styes.",
thankyou so much for your care and consideration - i will keep you posted.,
"rob dear unbeliever, thankyou so much for detailing your experiences - you have suffered with your eyes more than me what with retinopathy and maculopathy - although having blurred eyesight is a real pain.",
waiting for the condition to clear so that i can drive safely is a real bind.,
how strange that we should both get conjunctivitis periodically in the left eye.,
"if i get the ""speedy solution"" you wish for me i will most certainly share the remedy here.",
"thanking you once again, rob ju, i was referring to krukenberg.",
"i had to dig deep for info of any meaning for krukenberg and, as you know, there is not a lot of data.",
"however, i did find one paper from the us that suggested the age factor and i will go thro all of my searches to find it.",
the peripheral test is a common advantage visiting specsavers of course.,
the retinopathy test is a 100% conclusive result either way which you are also probably aware.,
if your husband has not had the test before do not let him drive afterwards as the fluid dilates letting in too much light and can feel like sun blindness.,
i went on my bike so beat the system.,
come back to you soon.,
"rob dear ju, i have always been shown the two photographs immediately and had their content explained both in the uk and here.",
some practitioners offer copies in cd or ordinary format as they have their computerised version for their record.,
in your case they have to prepare a report for your clinic or doctors' practice and may not be so co-operative.,
mainly they are sincere technicians and know how much you are worried and i am sure that they will at least give you some info.,
i hope they do and that it is good news.,
if not don't worry most 'leaking' capillaries can be 'healed' (stopped) with lazer treatment and thus arrest any further deterioation.,
my blurred eyes have prevented me from searching the other matter for you but will try to find it.,
"regards, rob dear ju, have found the reference on google for k'berg - page 1, 2nd entry under wikipedia.",
my memory served me well - the average age not affecting the over 40's.,
as wickipedia always asks for latest info updates for all of its definitions the answer just might be unreliable.,
good luck this week - i am endeavouring to set an appointment also as i missed the last couple of years.,
"i was the first patient in bali to use the retinopathy equipment - hey ho, another large bill !!",

"hi all, i am type 2 with severe neuropathy and have just started regularly testing my glucose levels, my previous dn did not advocate testing and i was happy as long as my results were good.",
"my symptoms have got slightly worse over the last year and my latest hba1c was 9.6, (previously i have been around 6.3 for four years).",
my meter has gone from everything from 6.8 up to 24 in the last couple of weeks and i am terrified of sustaining further damage.,
"my dns, who was very helpful and informative and encouraged me to continue testing, has increased my metformin from 2 x 500mg to 3 x mr per day.",
will this make enough of a difference to my levels or should i be enquiring about a different drug?,
i am also following a strict diet but i have really been astounded by the huge fluctuations in my levels.,
normally i would rather not take more medication to solve the problem but these levels seem really high especially in light of the fact i already have bad complications.,
all advice greatfully received many thanks i just want to say thank you all so much for all your comments and advice - you have really helped and given me something to think about also.,
"so sorry for the late reply, i usually check on here everyday but have not been able to this week.",
i am overweight and 34.,
my neuropathy started overnight and very painfully in 2008.,
i went into denial for about four years and shamefully am only just trying to take control.,
the nurse always said my hba1c is really well controlled at 6.7 and not to test.,
well i feel very dissapointed in myself for turning a blind eye to it.,
"i fell into a bad depression because of the pain which in the beginning never let up, i couldn't even sleep, it has been awful but there is some relief thanks to several different pain medications.",
"now i am trying the low carb diet which is really difficult because i love bread, though now i see it as my enemy.",
"my goal is to get to a normal weight and give up some of the medication i take like blood pressure etc, it does make me angry that i have created the environment for diabetes to thrive and i will always need pain meds - but i will be giving it my all from now on and hope it's not too late.",
"the first thing i said to the dn was that i didn't think upping the metformin would help me because my readings went really high, i even had a spike of 24 which after an hour went down to 14 - it was my own fault on that one because i slipped and had a slice of rye bread but i had no idea it would go that high.",
i am back in a month to see how it's going so hopefully at some point i can bring my sugars under control.,
i will definitely look into the b12 to see if that helps.,
"again, thank you kindly for taking the time to reply to me, it is very much appreciated.",
"thanks toksik and doug, i will read the article and i will ask at my surgery to see if i would be able to try one of the medications you mention, thanks very much anything to help with weight loss would be very well received - i was told on thursday that my thyroid needs medication and that ties in with gaining weight i didn't expect.",
kind regards lauren thank's very much doug kind regards lauren,

"hello, i have felt ill for several weeks.",
last week i went to the doctors and they sent my urine away to see if i had an infection and was sent for bloods.,
i slept for 32 hours with my husband waking me to eat.,
i rang the surgery for my blood results and they said they were normal.,
this week i have still felt ill and been really hungry and thirsty.,
the surgery sent me a letter to make an appointment regarding my blood test.,
when i rang they said that my hba1c is 79.2 and to make an appointment.,
last night at work i felt even worse and my blood sugar reading was 28.1.,
i rang the emergency number for doctor who saw me straight away.,
he tested my urine as he said if there were ketones present i was being admitted to the acute medical ward.,
he said there were ketones but just between a trace and negative so he tripled my metformin (to 3 x 500mg a day) and told me to go the gp this morning to get blood cultures done.,
i went to the gp this morning who told me i was poorly controlling my diabetes and he wouldn't need bloods done i would be tired as that's what happens when it is poorly controlled and that i need to write a diary of what i eat.,
i eat healthily and exercise a little (walk to work and dog walks).,
i was diagnosed following an operation in january 2011 at 38 years old.,
my sister is type 1 diagnosed at 5 and my brother is type 1 diagnosed at 25.,
"i feel like the doctor is not taking me seriously enough as i struggle to see clearly and feel sick, hungry, thirsty and tired.",
any suggestions?,
my blood sugar is currently 20.1.,
i suspected type 1 myself.,
my sister works at a hospital and has just spoken to the diabetic consultant.,
he said my gp needs to go to medical school and i am classic type 1 and need insulin.,
he is in a different area to me and said to ring nhs direct and tell them to refer me to a diabetic clinic this afternoon.,
hubby rang nhs direct who said go to gp!,
i am so fed up of this.,
i am so tired and feel full of cotton wool and really want to just curl in a ball and sleep and ignore it all.,
i have eaten low carb for months.,
this month my intake of carbs has crept up but not hugely.,
"i don't eat much processed food at all, we cook from scratch and have lots of veg, salads and fruit.",
"hello, i ended up in a & e. the diabetic nurse came to see me and said that i was type 1 and should of been on insulin since i came out with symptoms two years ago.",
she said that my body had tried to keep working and had now reached crisis point.,
i went from the waiting room to being in 'majors' with canulas in within ten minutes.,
"i now have insulin, humalog three times a day and lantus at night.",
i cried with relief.,
"i knew i was ill, and not because of poor diet.",
"my gps had pigeon holed me because of my age not my family history, and i wish i had battled more, but was too tired.",
diabell make sure you insist on the proper tests x,
"hi, i wonder if anyone can help?",
i have recently been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.,
i am 37 and otherwise very fit and healthy.,
"i have always had an active lifestyle and have eaten a good diet, never been overweight.",
"i have recently read an article on why skinny people get diabetes, and two subjects caught my eye: 1. type 1.5 diabetes is more common in lean diabetic people and can be misdiagnosed as type 2, is this true and how can i find out if i am type 1.5?",
"i have been on medication now for three weeks and my sugar levels are still between 14 and 32, so i am wondering if i am getting the wrong treatment?",
2,
four years ago i had a nasty accident which caused great trauma to my right hand.,
not long after that i started getting ichy genetals which i now understand can be a symptom of diabetes.,
i went to the doctors on and off over the years about these symptoms and was given various creams with little success.,
"recently i was given a cream which sorted the problem, but then i started developing the classic symptoms of diabetes ( thurst and excessive use of the toilet), which prompted me to get tested.",
"my question is, do you think i could have had diabetes all this time?",
and is there a strong link between developing diabetes and the trauma to my hand.,
any opinions or links to useful articles would be greatly appreciated!,
thanks!,
morning everyone...can any tell me if its ok to have evaporated unsweetend milk?,
i have a nice recipe with sugar free jelly i would like to try but not sure on the milk...thanks dam...ok thanks...is that the unsweetened one?,
ill make the recipe the weekend take my sugars before and 2 hours after and see.,
i havnt had any treats of any sorts for 6 weeks so ill make it my treat lovinglife said: what's the carbs?,
natural sugars in evaporated milk will by nature be concentrated as the name suggests it is milk that the liquid has been evaporated from to leave fats sugars etc behind - personally i would leave it alone and use something like cream or creme fresh what's the recipe?,
maybe we can help suggest an alternative - if it's the one making jelly with the milk it works just as well with cream and creme fresh click to expand... hi...its just a sachet of sugar free jelly strawberry or raspberry.,
then mix in a tin of the milk with a handful of berries and set.,
it makes 6 to 8 portions.,
i have found if i don't eat a lot of fat at meals i rise after about an hour but if i eat a lot of fat with meals i stay steadier and need less insulin at meals.,
how would i reduce fat to lose a few pounds without rising?,
if i take more insulin i will go low 1st.,
i could split doses but seems counter productive to keep insulin low to lower weight?,
am i missing something?,
thank you for your replies i should have been more precise.,
"when i say carbs i mean a small handful of green beans or asparagus, sometimes broc.",
"here are my meals.. bf 2/3 avocado (guac) 6 inches celery and a radish l 1 oz deli turkey with mustard and mayo, small handful green beans and mushrooms with evoo, a little left over guac, and a radish dinner 1/2 can tuna/salmon or 3 oz some other fish (occasionally beef/lamb) a small salad and a few other green veg.",
i am giving up nuts because i tend to over eat them and think i have an intolerance.,
they made a great snack but am trying olives now.,
i seem to always need 'something' around 1 1/2 hours even if it's only 3 olives.,
"i eat no high gi foods, grains, root veg, sugar, fruit (except avocado) starch etc.",
i have been experimenting with taking insulin a few minutes before meals but not sure that is helping.,
"perhaps i should just continue my main meals, stop the nuts and see what happens?",
"my main diet is always 80% fat, 15% p and 5% carbs all in green veg.",
i have been doing this even before diabetes.,
i just have no idea where the weight came from.,
i just popped 10 pounds on in 3 months.,
"it is steady there but anymore and i need to go pants shopping, haha.",
thoughts?,
i have been thinking about you and the cole slaw.,
i have issues with too much raw cabbage but wonder if nappa cabbage would work.,
i don't seem to have problems with that type of cabbage.ever since you posted that i have been craving it!,
bok choy may work too.,
mayo on anything helps more than evoo for some reason.,
guac work wonders for me too.,
maybe i should eat it with all meals.,
seems excessive even though i love it.,
strange i have no problems digesting it as it too is high in fiber psyllium has the opposite effect for me.,
i would never need a bathroom...haha the fiber thing is a great idea if i can find one i can digest.,
that is another issue that makes eating a struggle for me.,
"no dairy either, uhg.",
also do you think sometimes too much fat or fiber slows things so much that you run out of insulin and go a little higher later around 3 hours?,
i notice that too.,
i stay steady for 3 hours and then start rising.,
i take 1 unit with meals so it seems feasible i could be running out before the protein gets there.,
i seem to do a lot of gluconeogenesis as i cannot eat any protein with bf or i spike thought?,
"tim2000s said: that can be an issue, but you should also be aware that many people who eat a lot of protein ""double bolus"" once with the meal and then a couple of hours later to manage the rise that takes place as gluconeogenesis kicks in.",
the second bolus is usually around 50% of the first.,
click to expand...,
i i do have a meal with a lot of protein i do double bolus.,
i don't eat a lot of protein normally.,
1 oz at lunch and 3 oz dinner.,
it does seem more than 3 oz would require a double bolus but i tend to eat small meals in size due to digestion issues.,
i have always been a grazer but now need to keep that to a minimum of course.,
"azure said: @kristin251 have you just checked with your doctor that there isn't anything else causing the weight gain (eg thyroid issues, etc)?",
your diet seems very sparse so it's not like you're over-eating in any way or anything.,
click to expand...,
the nuts kept my calorie content quite high.,
i was probably eating 3 oz macadamias by the end of the day!,
i have never required a lot of calories and have much more energy if i keep meals small.,
too much food in general bogs me down.,
i haven't eaten carbs in many years as i would fall comatose asleep 45 min later but i have always done better on lots of fat.,
i love my mayo i had thyroid done 6 months ago and all good.,
going to endo next monday so will be requesting that as well.,
i tend to run closer to hyer than hypo but things do change... totto said: ever tried making sauerkraut coleslaw?,
i love it.,
click to expand...,
"the thought of sauerkraut has me wincing, haha.",
love it but it does not love me back.,
tim2000s said: there is nothing to stop you double bolusing with smaller amounts of insulin if you are seeing rises anyway.,
it's the essence of sugar surfing and is far more effective at maintaining control... click to expand...,
i agree not only does it give me better bs control but i also feel more stable.,
do you think 1 unit with the meal and 1/2 45 minutes later would be good?,
i still wouldn't eat slabs of protein as i don't feel good with lots.,
i guess my meter will tell me azure said: i love macadamias too!,
the only thing that stops me eating a packet at a time is the price here : d another thought occurred to me - could some of the weight gain be due to weight you lost prior to diagnosis?,
"when i was diagnosed, i put on weight (and more than i'd lost too) but as my body settled down my weight normalised.",
my final thought is could you have some level of insulin resistance?,
"click to expand... once i get going on the macs (or any other nuts for that matter) i forget the price, haha.",
not cheap here either.,
i have better portion control with pistachios.,
2 or 3 and i'm good good thought on the weight gain from dx but i don't think so.,
i was dx'd almost 2 years ago and i did put the 20#s i rapidly lost on in two months.,
it stayed steady there for about a year then slowly rising and about 8 in the last 3 months.,
i have been on and off with the nuts so not overly optimistic it is them.,
i will be 52 in may so hormones might come into play.,
"i don't necessarily need to lose the weight but i do need it to stop right now, lol.",
thanks for all the help every one.,
lots to consider insulin resistance?,
"good question, you tell me... a high fat meal keep the spike slow and low.",
"however, a high fat meal can also make us ir.",
i take 1 unit with meals.,
a 1/2 unit correction bolus away from food can drop me 20-30.,
i do wonder if the nuts made me ir or kept things slow and low from meal to meal?,
my typical (with a few odd ones) bs readings are around 80 fasting and 80-115 (usually around 105)before the next meal.,
i realize these are good numbers but i still would like to tighten up the spike somehow.,
maybe i will have to bolus 1/2 and have a small snack in between a meal.,
can we ever get this right without testing every hour?,
lol would i be better off just letting it ride up and take insulin 15 min before the next meal?,
fluctuating bs makes me crawl out of my skin tim2000s said: exactly that - use your meter to work out the appropriate dose.,
115 isn't a spike.,
"non-diabetics reach above 140, they just don't stay there as long as ds tend to.",
115 is right in the middle of where you should be!,
click to expand... today 3 hours after bf and light yoga bs went from 77 to 98.,
not a big deal but i took 1/2 unit and had a piece of romaine swiped with mayo and 2 olives.,
maybe that will help with lunch bolus by having a little residual left.,
"i started backing lunch insulin up as well and again rose 3 hours after, i just think i run out before all my foods are digested being on such low doses so maybe adding a little in between will help from meal to next meal.",
azure said: i do think tiny insulin adjustments can help.,
"yes, it's tedious to have to test and experiment, but i make myself do it.",
"i find moving the time of my bolus can make a big difference (for me, at least).",
"another thing - and this may not be at all relevant - but, for example, i find if i skip breakfast or have a late breakfast i'm very prone to my blood rising.",
i now avoid doing that.,
just one example of how little changes can help.,
you mentioned your age and hormones.,
"i don't know anything about your particular circumstances, but never underestimate hormones.",
"when i was on the pill, i put on weight almost overnight.",
i also found my blood sugar was higher than usual and control was harder.,
"i'd never have believed hormones coukd have such an effect, particularly on weight gain, until i saw it with my own eyes.",
click to expand...,
i am not sure backing up my bolus works.,
it seems to for the meal but then i go higher after.,
it is helping with bf for sure.,
i am going to try adding 1/2 until with a small snack in between bf and l to see if that helps.,
i also think i run out of lantus during the day as i only take 2 sometimes 3 units so i don't think it covers me during the day.,
i tried taking 1 unit in the morning and hypo'd all day so that is not an option.,
"thanks again, you are helping my brain figure things out.",
what's one extra stick right?,
no biggy.,
wish me luck!,
"ah yes, dreaded hormones.. pre dx they told me i was post menopause and this past june they said i was back to peri menopause so surely those buggers mux into the equation.",
i haven't had a period for over 7 years.,
i had ablation so i have no way of knowing what's going on.,
it's all a mystery,
my 92 year old mum was admitted to hospital in november of this year after slipping and twisting her knee.,
"she is currently still in hospital, is not eating and is constantly being sick and vomiting bile and has been for at least three weeks.",
"we have now found that the diabetic experts, at one point, stopped giving her her insulin but then restarted it but on a different type.",
"mum was originally on novamix, 10 units twice a day and we were reasonably in control and no vomiting.",
now it looks as though my mum is on the point of death due to a twisted knee.,
her insulin has been changed for a slow acting one.,
the last reading i saw was 11.something before breakfast in a morning and the nurse admits mum has not eaten anything for days and is still vomiting.,
"obviously, if she is constantly feeling sick she will not want to eat.",
but we cannot get any definite answers from the staff - just fobbed off and told its her own fault as she won't eat.,
mum is also diagnosed with advanced dementia and has been t2 diabetic for about forty years.,
she has also received numerous injuries and skin tears at the hospital - one extremely nasty one had an elastoplast over but it was left flapping off and a very nasty open wound exposed.,
why do hospital mess around and 'fix what wasn't broken' - making people that do not understand anymore what is happening to them and leaving in a worse state than they were in before they were admitted?,
her blood sugars appear to be all over the place and they test her blood at stupid o clock - i.e.,
on numerous occasions at 11:45 at nights - they do not feed her in the manner she is fed at home so she is not getting regular intakes of food and if a carer is not there to feed her the food is just removed without being touched - we have queried this and have been told it is because the night staff do it and sometimes they don't get around to it.,
at home her sugar is tested between 07:30 and 08:30 and in the evening between 16:00 and 17:00 and she eats regularly with regular snacks.,
"additionally, why oh why do diabetic patients not have a sign or notification over their bed ( a picture would do) mum has a blue butterfly to indicate dementia (i had to push for that too) so would a picture of a bee or a cupcake be a good indication - this would enable the person taking the tea trolley round to see at a glance not to put sugar in her tea!!!!",
"we have this problem every time the tea trolley comes round in our presence so it must be happening when we aren't there too we actually sued in 2011 and do not want to go down that route again - the hospital admitted liability that time but all i really want is for elderly, confused diabetics to receive the correct treatment and to not end up coming out of hospitals in a worse state than they went in.",
"i have been living with her for seven years now christine - my hubby still lives at our house, we look after mum between ourselves and we pay carers to sit with her whilst i go to work (shifts and full time) - we are also paying the carers to sit at hospital with her but they are only working the days they would normally work so i go in myself when i am on my (fluctuating) rest days.",
at the moment she can't stand so we are having to have a best interest meeting - i am already threatening to discharge her and go to the papers.,
non of injuries have occurred in the presence of a carers.,
after the last time (when we sued on the advice of social services who backed us) we made sure we had full and lasting power of attourney (including health) as now they have to get a court order to oppose us - whereas previously they took it all out of our hands - that's another warning for anyone caring for an elderly relative - make sure you have the medical power of attourney too!!!!,
we learnt the hard way!,
it is frightening to think that mum only stopped driving and sold her car in 2008!,
"so sorry to hear that christine, as you say she is not suffering now.",
please accept my condolences and sympathy i am afraid i went to visit mum last thursday and she has even more injuries.,
i have not been able to visit since due to work but am going again tonight.,
"(i work shift work) the hospital she is currently in is called castle hill in cottingham, near hull.",
they are insisting she had her injuries before she arrived and prior to that she was in hull royal infirmary (thats who we sued) as i have carers and district nurses in we know her current injuries were definately not caused at home - the carers agency are brilliant and wouldnever have allowed it!,
we have to go to a meeting on 8th january but i am afraid i get really angry everytime i go and see more and more injuries.,
they just say it is because her skin is so thin but it is just as thin at home.,
"on the plus mum, although looking dreadful she still has the strength to swear at me so i know she is still fighting.",
lol i have taken photo's on my phone and they are acceptable as evidence - i know this as i am actually a police investigating officer.,
(hence the shift work!),
and we do accept mobile photo's and own injury photos or make appoontments for photos of injury with our own soco i have also mentioned what is happening at work and shown them my pictures.,
thanks jopar - i did not name and shame the hospital - i was replying to a question by iono further up the thread.,
it doesn't help that mum is deaf too (most of the family are - including me and we wear hearing aids) another thing that is really bugging me is that we had to ask and nag a bit to get a 'blue butterfly placed above mum's bed - this is so that nurses are aware she has dementia but they won't put a note/sign or picture of anything up to signify she is diabetic.,
#NAME?,
we have been told that there is a list in the tea making room so 1) how can the tea lady (who vary every day) remember a whole ward of who is diabetic and who isn't and 2) if they have a list why don't they have it with them so they don't have to ask or even refer to it so they don't have to ask and 3) wouldn't it be easier all round to just put a little picture to represent 'diabetic' over the bed so the tea lady wouldn't need to refer to lists or ask or put sugar in diabetics tea which is obviouslyhappening?,
"thanks bopeep, i told them that she certainly did not receive the injuries at home and as we have a carer agency who provide carers all the time i am at work and district nurses in twice a day, all her ailments and any form of injury is logged at home so i know i am well covered there!",
i think they are tryiong to blame the previous hospital but she was only in there for one night.,
the did do a body chart and i noticed there was a large mark on the back of her upper thigh marked on it - i couldn't see the injury obviously as she was laid inbed but that was the only mark i have seen on the body charts.,
last night when i went they had sat mum in a chair but i was shocked to see she was so bent over that her head was almost touching her knees and she couldn't straighten up.,
she now has both feet bandaged up.,
mum swears like a trooper.,
now.,
it doesn't bother us as we know it is all part of the dementia and she always hated swearing.,
mum was also complaining that her back hurt but two nirses just oiked her up and dumped her on the bed.,
i have already been in touch with social services safeguarding.,
we were approached on new years eve by another patient who told us they could hear mother screaming on a night when the nurses go in.,
she does scream a lot a home.,
very sad for an intelligent lady to end up like this - i don't really understand why mums bm is very high when she is barely eating a thing.,
and if her sugar is haywire we know that can slso affect her personality.,
we also don't understand why they test her blood sugar at times like quarter to twelve at night and half five in a morning and then not again until the evening.,
potty.,
we no longer have a clue what type of insulin she is on - if any.,
the care agency boss went in to see her last weekend and tried to ask the nrse what was going on but the nurse just said she didn't know and hadn't got mums records handy or somethng like that.,
funnily enough even the nasty nurse say sthat mum is always quiet when i am there - to me that tells me that she feels safer when she has someone with her.,
off to work now and then straight to hospital tonight.,
thank you to everyone for your support.,
and kindness = it does help to get things and worries off your chest thanks everyone.,
just to update.,
we had a meeting yesterday.,
i am now looking for a nursing home as i have been told thatmum is now unable to even sit up and she is not suitable to go in a hoist as she no longer has the capacity to understand that they are llifting her.,
"i went in on monday night, i was a bit late leaving work so dashed n to let the dogs out for a minute then dashed up to the hospital arriving about thirty minutes later that usual - mum was on a chaior and alone in her room.",
bent double with her heasd almost on her knees and her arms just hanging almost to the floor.,
i got down and said what on earth is happening?,
she just said my back hurts.,
with that a nurse and an auxilary came in and the nurse snapped - thats how she wants to sit.,
then they grabbed her a side each and slung her on the bed.,
"the they quite roughky threw her legs up and proceeded to change her pants, they were shouting telling her wa=hat they were doing but mum can't hear unless you get up close to her ear and she was screaming that her back hurt and fighting them.",
the nurse had a right go at me.,
the follwong day i went in and it was a different nurse and she was very nice.,
both mum's legs bandaged up to the knees and she was slumped over to a side and looked very uncomfortable.,
she was upset and angry - she doesn't lknow what is happening part from they are hurting her.,
her left thigh was a lot fatter than her right although it was the right that she had the twisted knee.,
"followong the meeting at the hosptial yesterdaya nd even though i have full and lasting power of attourney i am told i would need 2, possibly three carers 24/7 and would most likely have to ger up every two hours during the night tio turn her.our care agency do not provided care to that extent and i am told mum is now totlally bedridden and can't even sit up unaided.",
the morla of the stroyis do not get old or get dementia or twist your knee.,
i still don't know what is happening with her insulin apart from she has lost loads of weight - i was told she is now on humani but they might put her back on novamix (which she was on in the first place with no problems) i am heart broken to think that i wanted to care for mum and have done for eight years now and this has all happened to her because she slipped and twisted her knee and at that point she could sit up and move around with her wlking frame.,
even the dog is missing her and keeps going and putting her head on mums shoulder wrap.,
i have spoken to safeguarding and they are taking the case up.,
even if it's too late for mum - we may be able to help someone else.,
thanks you bopeep12300 and 2christine - although i have never met either of you you have been so lovely and i really do appreciate your kind words and support.,
the safeguarding people are going in tomorrow.,
mum was very weak tonight.,
i sang to her again.,
if the nurses don't like me sinigng they can go whistle.,
i must admit i barely slept last night.,
i really wanted mum to spend her last years at home but i really don't know how i can do it now she is so bad.,
i was looking for homes - i have been trawling the internet but i have to find ones that do nursing and dementia care.,
i am looking for one as near as possible to home so that i will be able to go in and i have told them that if there is any improvement in her i am having her back home even if i have to kidnap her.,
my dad died at home 2christine - 2001.,
"i was not actually here when he died but he just sat in his favopurite chair, mum said she would just answer the phone then get him his tea and he said okay and went she finished on the phone he was gone.",
"i came round and sat with him and my daughter did too, she had just turned 14, and we said goodbye to him.",
my daughter idolised him and she was the apple of his eye so it was nice in a way.,
my daughter spent a lot of time with her 'grumps' and grandma and is terribly upset at how mum has been treated.,
i am working late shifts now until tuesday so my husband weil have to do the visiting.,
then we only have a couple of days to sort out a nursing home.,
me again....haven't posted in a long while!!,
anyway i made a post about constantly being tired a little while ago and i went to the doctor's and she has said that my thyroid is fine and to just take vitamins etc...anyway i have been doing that and i still feel so so tired...as if i haven't had a wink of sleep when in actual fact i have had about 8 or 9 hours sleep!,
i am just getting so fed up!,
i am 20 and i just feel so drained and fed up!!,
i also thought it could be boredom of my job but it still happens when i am not working so who knows what it is!!,
"i am on citalopram and 900mg of gabapentin a day but i know these aren't the cause as i have been feeling like this way before i was taking these tablets carbsrok said: hi nicola, sorry to hear you are still feeling so tired.",
have you been checked out for me/cfs?,
if all blood tests are normal and you are still tired then there has to be a reason.,
it's not acceptable for a gp to say take vitamins with further investigation.,
click to expand... me/cfs?,
what is that?,
i don't think i have been checked for anemia either!,
i am just so fed up andbreathe said: how's your back these days?,
do you manage quality sleep with that?,
click to expand... back is okay...it never really bothers me anyway it's just my leg that i get grief with but it's alright once i have laid down etc!,
so i don't think it's that!,
i am seeing the surgeon next week to discuss my options for my back as i have two very large discs bulging!,
"totto said: nicolaanne, please remind me, what were your thyroid results?",
and did you get antibodies checked?,
"click to expand... she didn't tell me what they was specifically just that they were ""okay"" i am back to the doctors on the 31st to get my mri results for my brain scan for my migraines....rather worried about that but i will make a point of mentioning that and not letting her shrug me off!",
as for stress it has died down alot as i haven't been under as much as things with my dad are okay now!,

xx totto said: of course.,
just give them a call.,
i keep copies of all test results.,
everything.,
click to expand... well i have got to go in there tonight after work...as i need more insulin so i will ask then...if i remember!!,
"catherinecherub said: hi nicola, you say that the anti-depressant and pain killers are not the cause.",
both of these have sedating effects and it could be the timing of them that is adding to the problem.,
if you take them in the morning then they will make you tired throughout the day.,
might be worth seeing your g.p.,
to see if you can split the dosage so that you take some a.m. and some p.m. and see if that helps to overcome the tiredness.,
click to expand...,
i don't feel any worse than when i wasn't on them!,
as for gabapentin i have to take them 3 times a day!,
and if i don't then my headaches are back straight away!,
citalopram...i guess i could take them at night as that is only 1 a day!,
i forgot to mention..it isn't my bloods either...yes my hba1c is still high but it is the lowest it has ever been!,
and improving!,
totto said: lousy memory is a common symptom of thyroid under function.,

what is the difference between human insulins and modern insulins.,
i am on levemir and my sister is on insulatard.,
on what basis do doctors make decisions about which insulin to use.,
:shock: thank you very much kewgirl for that information.,
i have just been on insulin for 3 days.,
i am nearly 67 and i have a very strong feeling that my insulin producing bit has finally given up the fight.,
"i am still finding it quite emotional sticking that ""pointy thing into my tummy"".",
who do i thank for the corrective action to stop my rising hba1c.,
it was not my gp.,
it was sites like this that gave me the knowledge to realize i had a problem that need to be solved,
has anyone else put weight on since starting on insulin?,
i have put on nearly a stone in the last 6 months since starting insulin injections.,
thanks mshoane.,
i couldn't understand because i don't overeat and try to eat as healthy as i can.,
i am type 2 with a lot of other health issues.,
i have been diabetic for over 30 years but had to go on insulin in october 16 because metformin wasn't doing what it should.,
it must be too many carbs as i have potatoes and bread most days.,
i haven't had anything sweet since going on insulin.,
"hi, i was playing football yesterday and 2 of us went to kick the ball within close proximity to each other, we both connected at the same time and my big toe felt the full force of the impact.",
i struggled to play on for the rest of the game and have been in agony ever since.,
"obviously, we have to be careful with our feet.",
i am unable to put any pressure on it and can hardly move it.,
i'm having to walk on the side of my foot to compensate.,
"i don't think it's broken but it is severly bruised below the nail, all along the top of the toe and the bottom of the nail has started to go black.",
my metatarsel on that toe is also proving uncomfortable.,
is it worth me heading to a minor injuries unit (hospital name removed) and highlighting the fact i'm diabetic as well?,
any advice or previous experiences would be helpful.,
"thanks, andrew",
"type 1 diabetes - 23 years, i have recently done the cho counting course.",
also new to these forums.,
my blood sugars after lunch seems to require much more insulin than in the morning time.,
"the cp ratio appears to be around 2.5 to 3 at lunch, but 2.0 in the morning and 1.5 at evening meals.",
is such a fluctuation normal?,
"also exercise at 8am dramatically reduces insulin required at lunch (12-30pm), but morning insulin and food remain virtually unaffected ( i may need to take 1unit or 2 before exercise)- so a lag in response to exercise early in the day.",
exercise == 30 mins eliptical cross trainer - fairly rigorous.,
"if i exercise at evening meal , my body seems to react almost immediately to the exercise, and i lower insulin requirements by 6units then.",
blood sugar seems to regulate immediately after eating at 6pm and 30 min training at 6-30pm.,
my blood sugars are steady overnight and in the morning.,
its the afternoon fluctuation that can be complicated.,
are these fairly normal traits?,
thanks for the quick response!,
i take the basal insulin at 11pm normally.,
32 units of lantis.,
so is this a feasible reason?,
im puzzled by the issue.,
"some more information: if i lie in at the weekend , the afternoon sugar rise is far worse, and conversely if i train in the morning, the issue is more or less eradicated.",
so activity in the morning is almost necessary!,
the time when the sugar appears to rise is at 13-14 hours after the basal dose (between 12-30pm and 2-30pm).,
its directly after lunch.,
"sugars can absolutely rocket into the 20s very quickly after lunch, and correction doses are very high - 2units per 1mmol.",
"and i feel between 20-24 hours things are stable again, that is, if sugar levels are good at 6pm, they'll be fine at 11pm.",
very frustrating!,
"should i be taking any, and if so what?",
"i've read a few mentions of vitamins in various threads to the point it is now a niggle in the back of my head, a distraction i'd like to see addressed and laid to rest.",
"when it comes to vitamins a common response would be to get all your vitamins through your food, veg etc.",
but i'm more engrossed in finding meals/food stuffs that i can eat at the moment on the basis of what does or doesn't spike my bg levels and tbh no thought goes into to the body's vitamin requirements.,
"would i be better, for peace of mind, to just to start a '1 a day' multivitamin regime?",
i was reading about b1 supplements (thiamin..i think) the other day as well.,
"on the flip side i remember reading an article a while back saying that multivitamins were a waste of money, an unnecessary expense, cant recall the thread of the topic, think it was in the vein of myths, mouthwashes were purported to be another item that had little benefit behind it but still the consumer has ran with it.",
"starting to ramble nonsense now, always a good point to stop anyways, any views feel free....",
thanks.,
"edit just saw a few similar topics appear after i posted that never appeared on my initial search for 'vitiamins' never thought to try 'supplements' apols if already covered hi folks, thanks for the replies :wink: i managed to catch a quick read of grazers reply before i went out to the shops and on the strength of his good lady i bought myself a 90 day supply of multivitamins & iron (1 tablet) and a 90 day supply of cod liver oil, not being a fish hand i thought it was a wise buy, 1.89 for both or 60 odd pence a month, well within a scotsman's price range ..... all hail the aldi catherinecherub said: you will probably be eating more healthily now than you have done for a long time.",

happy new year to all :wave:,
i think this is what i have to do to get my blood sugars down.,
"they always go way up high after eating bread, potatoes, white rice and pasta, all my favourites.",
"doctor gave me a prediabetes pamphlet that included carbs in every balanced meal, even suggested baked beans on toast for breakfast!",
this made my blood sugars skyrocket and made me feel ravenous for the whole day.,
"i am prediabetic, no medications.",
"if you too are on a low carb diet, how long does it take before you stop craving these foods?",
"especially the bread, i will miss the bread!",
i am wondering if there is an optimal time to take metformin.,
i'm also on glicazide.,
"should i take it before a meal, after or during.",
i get liver dumps in the early hours of the morning and am wondering if i should take metformin at bedtime.,
"my pharmacist said it didn't matter when, but i've learned the people in this group have a wealth of experience.",

"i follow the instructions to the letter when 'infusing' it, but wondered if anyone has tried using it elsewhere (e.g.",
"stomach, leg, backside) and found that's maintained accurate (ish!)",
readings / results?,
i've herd the stomach can work.,
"thanks cofty yeah someone mentioned to me that they'd worn it on their stomach, i just wanted to hear if others had tried other places and if it had panned out ok in terms of readings.",
yes it is - thanks.,
"i've used medical tape, its been great but even then i sometimes have problems.",
i play a lot of squash and a larger sleeve might be a little restrictive in the racket swing.,
hoping it can work on the stomach - if anyone else has experiences there?,
"can someone explain this to me please?, my blood sugar reduces after i eat (depending what i've eaten!)",
"but when i wake it's 12+, and that's fasting, i'm confused!",
ewelina said: are you type 1 on insulin?,
"click to expand... no, i'm type 2 evidently on saxagliptin squire fulwood said: if you haven't eaten for a long time say 5 or 6 hours your liver provides you with sugar to keep you going until you eat again.",
in your case it seems to do just that but it results in a high of 12+ so we are talking diabetes here.,
"as for reducing after you eat, there is a little ambiguity here.",
do you mean it reduces to normal levels given time or just keeps going down.,
if the latter then there is a problem.,

"this morning i woke with a 13.8 blood sugar reading, came downstairs and at 9am had a glass of water and half a grapefruit that went to 14.8, then an hour and a half later at 10.30 i had a slice of bacon with an egg it went down to 9.3, i don't understand how it goes down after i've eaten like this morning.",

x nosher8355 said: the grapefruit is spiking you!,
click to expand...,
these are my last 5 days of glucose readings (if that helps) 14.0 after eating baked potato and chicken salad 12.2 on waking 10.8 after dinner of chicken fillets and veg 10.5 before bed 11.2 on waking 10.8 after breakfast of egg 10.2 before lunch 11.5 before dinner below!,
"10.8 after dinner of chicken and rice 9.1 on waking 12.6 lunchtime (not hungry so no lunch) 11.6 after dinner of chicken, sausage bbq and some salad 8.3 at 10.30am fasting 13.3 last night after dinner of fish and salad 13.8 on waking 14.8 after grapefruit 9.3 after bacon and egg i wonder if protein brings it down, but why?",
squire fulwood said: i don't find any of those readings particularly low and it makes me ask myself where you are getting the sugar from.,
your liver store is working well so that's one place.,
the baked potato might have been a mistake as was the rice and whatever you ate the sausage in.,
"as nosher said, the grapefruit could have been another mistake especially if you are one of the people that put sugar on it.",
if those readings were mine i would be thinking of cutting the carbs a lot more and going for walks more often.,
"click to expand... hi the sausage wasn't in anything as i'm wheat intolerant so i just had it with the chicken and salad from the bbq, the baked potato may be a factor as i felt very tired after eating it.",
"i should have said the rice was 'cauliflower rice' blanched and blitz in processor to make 'rice' not regular rice, i'm so used to calling it rice that i forget that others think i refer to normal grain rice.",
i walk around the whole of southwold each day with my daughter.,
what carbs do i have?,
am i missing something?,
nosher8355 said: to be normal readings at fasting is between 4 - 6mmols.,
your readings are not particularly low.,
the reason that you are getting lower readings is the natural fats in protein are slowing your digestion rate down and protein has very little of carbs.,
"in the period between fasting test and your testing after, you are probably rising and then going lower as there is not many carbs in your meals.",
everything is nomal for a diabetic with your range of readings.,
"you are doing everything you can, reducing carbs, exercise and testing.",
the meds will work and you should get your blood glucose levels down.,
"patience is required, and a couple of tips.",
eat regularly and eat little and often as long as it's low carb.,
are you getting more natural fats into your meals.,
"such as butter, cream, full fat yoghurt etc?",
click to expand...,
"i'm cows milk intolerant and soya is naturally high in sugar so i have skimmed goats milk and goats butter, i grill everything i don't fry, i eat poached eggs and the bacon i eat is grilled.",
"i don't eat yogurt no as it reminds me of when my baby's puked up milk, kind of puts me off.",
would you think that i should eat full fat milk etc?,
i use goats butter which is full fat.,
"i currently have skimmed goat milk, is that what i'm doing wrong?",
omnipod said: sounds like you need to speak to your diabetic team.,
those readings are too high and will cause long term complications.,
perhaps taking a background insulin like tressiba once a day may help?,
its peakless insulin so may help with your high morning readings.,

"thanks, i have an appointment thursday morning to see the diabetes specialist from the hospital.",
"ok, i will try that until thursday and see if it works, hopefully in 4 days i should see a difference.",
"hi well i have an update for everyone, i went to see the specialist and he has put me on gliclazide and ramapril, since taking it my blood sugar has dropped from 19 down to approx 5-6 during the day and about 6-7 overnight, for me that's good but since being on gliclazide and as i didn't usually eat carbohydrate as such i had an awful hypo, very scary and for two days afterwards my head hurt so badly that i felt like i'd been hit by a bus.",
"since this not so nice event i've tried to eat a few carbs instead of just protein and vegetables for dinner and it is working, i feel so much better i'm not exhausted all the time, i'm not thirsty and i have so much more energy.",
"i would definitely tell people with awful t2 levels to consider this, i was told that it can make you put weight on, so far i've been ok.",
i feel amazing!,
i guess many diabetics battle tiredness and have problems sleeping.,
"i'm type 1 and pump controlled, constantly tired and feel most of the time like i haven't slept.",
wondered if anyone has had any success with getting a decent night's sleep after suffering from the same.,
helensaramay said: how is your bg during the night?,
i struggle to sleep if my bg is too high or too low.,
"if my bg is under control, i am fine, get a good night's sleep and wake refreshed.",
"for me, my pump has greatly helped: once i got the basal levels set correctly, my sleep improved.",
"click to expand... my bloods are normally pretty good when going to bed, maybe the odd high, i use a fitbit to monitor sleep patterns and generally wake a couple of times but very rarely go into deep sleep for over an hour a night.",
"mel dcp said: yeah, steady, in range bgs are so important for getting good sleep.",
and good sleep is key to getting good levels.,
its a vicious circle are you in any pain or discomfort at night?,
is there anything you can change about your environment that may help?,
"my beloved husband snores dreadfully, so sometimes to break the poor sleep/poor levels cycle i sleep in another room for a few nights just to reset.",
click to expand...,
"i guess i should concentrate on that, no pain or discomfort in the night.",
my bloods aren't terrible but occasionally inconsistent.,
just tired or feeling tired mel dcp said: hmmmmm.,
do you use a cgm or finger pricks?,
"you might be able to see whats going on with a libre, perhaps?",
what are your levels when you wake up?,
click to expand...,
"i've started using the libre, struggling to afford the patches at the moment but i believe they're coming on prescription soon.",
it doesn't seem to matter if my bloods are perfect or high i still feel tired.,
"mel dcp said: might be worth going to see your gp to see if theres another problem, not all our ills are due to the diabetes, after all.",
"hope you find a solution soon, fatigue is just horrible.",
and fingers crossed you can get libre on prescription pdq.,
click to expand... yeah maybe you're right thanks for the advice.,
"helensaramay said: whenever i wake, i force myself to wake fully, take a reading and correct ... even if i got to bed on a good reading, if i wake in the night, 9 times out of 10, my bg is out of kilter.",
"once i correct, my sleep is good.",
click to expand... do you use the libre i used to check in the night when i woke.,
helensaramay said: i do not use the libre ...,
"it was not accurate enough for me click to expand... is bit and miss i found the higher my blood sugar the higher the error with the libre, if i was in range then it wasn't too far out.",
"alison54321 said: one possibility that you could consider is taking some magnesium, chelated is best.",
high blood sugars mean that people with diabetes lose more magnesium in their urine than other people.,
magnesium is very important for good sleep.,
"when i can't sleep it's the first thing i try, these days, since i found out about this, and no it wasn't from a doctor.",
you can google all this.,
"there are a few assumptions about the impact of this, that possibly go beyond the reality, but there is a clear link between poor sleep, and low magnesium, so it might be a factor.",
click to expand...,
i shall certainly try that thank you so much.,
"jlarsson said: if your blood sugar is the problem and you have all the necessary components, you may want to have a look at https://openaps.org/ which was designed specifically because the creator had difficulties sleeping.",
"https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/ is another project, shown in detail here: how to set up and use etc.",
"i don't use a pump myself, so i can't speak for how good any of this is in practise or how easy it is to set up, but it evidently works for some people.",
"click to expand... had a quick look, and it's very interesting this is where ideally you want to be with diabetes control.",
"i'll will look into it in detail but initially looks complicated, thanks.",
jenny15 said: i didn't know the fitbit could measure depth of sleep.,
usually the only way to really measure that is to have a formal sleep study at a clinic that your doctor can refer you to.,
"there are dozens of sleep disorders, many of which are treatable.",
"if you're satisfied that your blood glucose levels are in control enough to not be causing this, you might want to raise it with your doctor.",
don't let them fob you off.,
the most common sleep disorder that can cause extreme tiredness is sleep apnoea.,
usually affects older overweight people - but not always.,
"loud snoring is a common sign - but again, not always.",
unsatisfying sleep is a common symptom of this and other sleep disorders.,
i hope you're able to find out what is causing it.,
good luck.,
click to expand...,
"the fitbit gives you a good indication, it shows deep, light and rem sleep.",
"it uses movement and heart rate patterns, it shows that i'm in deep sleep for only about an hour a night, usually less.",
i'm not overweight and i don't snore.,
i'll see how the magnesium supplements go first i think.,
thank you.,
has anybody ever experienced blurred vision with low blood sugar?,
i thought this was only caused by hyperglycemia and it's never happened to me before.,
"however this evening i felt like i was having a hypo, tested and was 4.2 which i've been many times before and never felt shaky or strange at this level.",
my vision was also blurred in one eye and has only now returned to normal after eating dinner.,
diabetes related or not?,
thanks all!,
i was curious more than anything - never happened before!,
"t2, on no meds hba1c results 71 through 58 to recent 43.",
i just can't cope with diabetic regime anymore.,
"my diet has crashed and burned, i don't smoke nor drink alcohol, never did like salads, nuts and oaty things.",
"i like chips, pasta, rice and sugary things.",
i read the other day that prawns are not that good for us??,
"so, i've quit it all and gone back to my old diet, what will happen to me?",
"will i end up t1, what is diabetes likely to throw back at me, can anyone tell me please.",
how long will it take for anything to go wrong?,
"kind regards, q.. my brother just died 3 month ago, t1 and a two time amputee.",
"but, my gp told me i will not go from t2 to t1 in my lifespan, it was just after then that i gave up and went back to my old ways.",
"sent from the diabetes forum app thanks for the support but this is truly much more than a bad day, i really can't do this no more, not one day..",
sent from the diabetes forum app,
"hi all, new poster but i've been t1 diabetic for 24 years - diagnosed just before my 3rd birthday.",
"i should be a pro at this but alas, i'm not.",
"i've done carb counting courses, grown up with the condition, heck my mum is even a diabetes specialist nurse!",
"but i've had high hba1c results since my teens, and after getting my last result back at 95, and approaching 30, i've realised i need to knuckle down and manage this properly before long term complications set in.",
"i've started testing before meals and 2 hours after, adopted a low-mid carb diet to give myself a fighting chance, making sure i remember to inject with every meal and not an hour after as i've been prone to do...i know, i know.",
how i've only had dka once at 18 is a minor miracle.,
anyway.,
i'm a few days in and a bit stumped.,
"my sugars have been stable, but all around the 12 - 15 mark.",
"today for example: waking (9am): 9.0 mid morning (12pm): 12.2 pre-lunch (1pm): 13.4 post-lunch: (4pm) 15.1 now today i skipped breakfast because i overslept, and i'm wondering if my liver released glucagon in response?",
even though i was already at 9.0?,
gah i don't know.,
"lunch was a pasta salad, chicken pieces, and a galaxy ripple.",
admittedly not my low carb best but i've been exhausted all day and forgot to bring a packed lunch and i just can't be bothered today.,
"i worked my carb out at 70g, and corrected with an extra 3 units as my blood sugars have been pretty stubborn - so 10 units of novorapid in total.",
so i was surprised to see i've actually gone slightly up.,
"i take tresiba at 9pm, currently 18 units (as of last night), going to keep that as it is for a week to get an idea of if it's working.",
my carb to insulin ratio is 1:10 (ie.,
"default carb counting recommendations), but i wouldn't be surprised if this needs tweaking.",
but can anyone offer any insight?,
it might be super obvious to someone reading this but when it's your own body you can't see the wood for the trees sometimes...,

when does blood pressure get too low?,
normally my bp measures around 125 / 75 but the last few days i've woken up with it a lot lower so today it was 106 / 69.,
i take 7.5mg of ramapril / day.,
will be seeing the gp next week.,
should i mention this to him?,
thetallerpaul said: is low bp an issue?,
"click to expand... dunno paul that's why i was asking :lol: seriously, haven't had bp readings like this for years, if ever.",
the reading i had done just before going on ramapril a couple of years ago was 210 / something.,
i honestly have no idea what would count as too low which is why i asked.,
"noblehead said: hypotension (low bp) is below 90/60 according to the following article by the british heart foundation: http://www.bpassoc.org.uk/bloodpressure ... /whatislow i checked mine last week and got a 109/63 but feel fine at this level, if you are feeling dizzy or faint then it would be best to discuss this with your gp next week, it might be why you fainted in the bathroom a couple of weeks back.",

"thank you nigel, much appreciated.",
luckily no more fainting or cramp but it's on the list to discuss with the gp next week.,
"topsec said: xyzzy, i hope you don't mind me asking the question (and apologies for op for butting in) i don't have diabetes but frequent this forum as my husband is type 2.",
we both low carb (i do it as i feel it is unfair to him for me to sit and eat carbs whilst he can't).,
"i have also eased back on the salt during cooking to try to help his bp too (was high but is now in the high level of normal ) i feel fine and everything and have lost a few pounds so that's a bonus however i may have to sneak in the odd cake whilst i am out with friends as i need to arrest the weight loss, the question is i already have normal to low blood pressure but have noticed that since low carbing (about 10 weeks) i have started to get quite a lot of nightime cramps, is this something that is a sign of it being too low?",
i have always had that issue where if i get up from laying or sitting down i go very woozy and have to hold onto something.,
thanks ts click to expand... well as i was the op i don't mind at all :lol: i started to get night time cramps a few weeks ago and asked people for help and it ended up as a big thread here http://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes-forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=28647 with lots of people posting some good stuff.,
since i posted i have been drinking at least a glass of slimeline tonic in the evenings and mine has gone away.,
i will still be mentioning it to the doc next week as its probably wiser (and cheaper) to talk to him and get some pills if i need them.,
i don't think its related to low carb as my diet has been pretty consistent carb wise.,
both noblehead and others suggested the falling over fainting thing i got on one day good could have been down to low blood pressure.,
i think bp is lower in the night although i'm no expert on that.,
the getting up and woozy thing is quite common i think.,
"i use to get that quite a lot in my youth, not so much now.",
never asked or did anything about it as i assumed it was just something everyone got now and then but again if it worries you the doc is the best person.,

"i first went to the docs with suspected urine infection in 2009 but it didnt clear up and i then developed itchiness and a yeast infection,these havent cleared up even now.",
then i developed frequent urination in july 2010 and this is still with me.,
been checked by 2 urologists and this isnt a urological problem.,
in that time i've had many flu/virus like symptoms which have come and gone.,

"i went to my doctor yesterday and was going to ask for a referral to an endrocrinologist and had an episode of low blood sugar,3.7 just before i went so was able to get through a little to the doctor more than before.",
"ive suffered from these episodes for a few years,shaky,sweaty,cold hands,very pale,needw to eat something sugary asap but they are happening a lot more frequently of late,most mornings 2-3 hours after breakfast and sometimes in evening.",
"in fact a few months back i went to the dentist and the dentist thought i was going to faint as i looked so bad,i have no fear of dentists btw.",
i made it through the treatment and when i got home i was able to test and i was 2.9mmol on that occasion.,
so i do suffer from low blood sugar but i didnt even think of this until it happened on a doctor visit day.,
it may help with a diagnosis.,
"also i've developed tingling hands and fingers of a night and morning over last couple of months,is this significant at all?",
"i just thought i'd update and let you know that i'm eventually seeing an endrocrinologist tomorrow but it looks very much like i've got the totally unrelated diabetes insipidus,nephrogenic,rather than diabetes mellitus like most of you on here.",
so my symptoms were similar but were indicating a different diagnosis.,
best wishes,
i've just been informed that i have to use the public changing room toilet in work to change my pump cannular instead of a sterile drugs room in residential care home where i work .,
is this hygienic enough and what are my rights ?,
help !!!!,
not really a reason but it was implied i would use a residents insulin their reasonable adjustments are ' the toilet is ok to use ' .,
there is no sharps box to use so i have to walk through the home with exposed needles .,
"i work an 11 hour day so it's hard to make judgments on how much insulin i give , i've had to skip a few meals so i don't use up my cartilage which means i can't change it",
hi guys !,
"i've recently switched from rice to pearl barley, and my sugar level is much more stabilized,.",
"usually, after a meal i had around 260 sugar, and in 1hour it lowered to 180.",
"after trying out barley, i have stable 180 sugar.",
"should i just give up on eating rice, and what other foods are good for normal lunch for diabetic ?",
"well, i'd love to switch to cauliflower, but i'm afraid i will be instantly hungry, and i will have lower sugar level :/ sunnyexpat said: basmati rice is worth a try.",
grated cauliflower is grated cauliflower.,
click to expand... that's the problem.,
"i was eating basmati, it just didn't work for me.",
"now, i have stable 180 sugar, but i can't eat pearl barley forever i'll try to experiment, but i'm stil not convinced to grated cauliflower.",
i just don't know if i will eb able to calculate my insulin for it.,
"is there any place i can post my whole diet, and get some feedback on it ?",
"i was told this is one sweet treat you can eat please can anyone confirm this for me, thanks",

i was 7.10 stone 2 weeks ago and now my weight has gone down even further to 7.1 stone.,
i am wasting away!!,

all i do is to cut carbs out of my used to be carbs heavy diet..,
please help me!!,

please seek some medical advice -- are you testing your bg levels ??,
if not -- get a meter and test until you see your gp -- possibly you could be type 1 ( don't know but is possible ) sending hugs !!!,

thank you for replying to me.,
i will try to book an appointment with gp first thing in the morning.,
i don't test as i have this fear of needle and also i thought i would wait till having the second test after the first 3 months with dn.,
i know most members here test themselves... but my fear of needle uses the excuse that dn gave me which is no need to test i can become obsessed...,
so i thought i would wait and see if my diet works..,

on eof the most obvious signs of lada is sudden severe weight loss.,
i was in your shoes.,
58 and 94#s before finally diagnosed.,

i was so weak and freezing.,
many docs dont like doing these tests.,
insist.,

thank you for replying to me.,
now i will have to look up what is gad and lada as i am still new here and know little about diabetes.,
"my weight loss started only since i started low carbs diet, before that i was fine with a healthy weight.",
did you suffer from the weight loss before being diagnosed?,
i do feel weak and right now suffering from a bad cold with proper headache and running nose.. himtoo said: hiya red river !!,
"without sounding panicky -- i would be worried about a 20 lb weight loss -- only you can know if you have other symptomatic signs of d ( thirstyness , weeing constantly , tired , irritable ) go stand at the gp door tomoerrow morning at opening time -- click to expand...",
i was diagnosed only because i asked to have a diabetes test.,
i was having a blood test after a course of iron supplements as i was then anemic.,
i suspected i might have diabetes because my mum and most people on that side of family have it.,
"also the fact that my second child was 9.1 pounds when born, so i could tick more than one box on the on line self test.",
"i don't think i have any other symptoms of being diabetic, maybe the fact that i need to wee more often, but not too bad and i don't have to get up during the night even now.",
i do drink more in the evening as i always realised i don't drink enough during the day so try to make up for it in the evening.,
"since being diagnosed i almost cut out carbs totally and skip meals too for not knowing what to eat, and feeling scared of eating..",
"i never eat a lot, but my meals used to based on carbs.",
i don't snack.,
could just cutting carbs or not eating enough is the cause of this weight loss??,
i will try to see a gp tomorrow as you advice.,
thank you.,
"himtoo said: perhaps add up the total calories you are eating per day ( not just the carbs -- or lack of ) if the total is less than 800 - 1000 than indeed you could be starving yourself without realising it click to expand... oh i hope that's the case, not because of any underlying illness i might be having, as i only count carbs not calories.",
i almost became vegetarian and even cut down on root vegetables..,
i have a much smaller potion now too.,
i just wonder a lot of members here eat so little and even no breakfast and seem not having the same problem as i do.,
himtoo said: hiya lovely -- see below and for your info ( to answer your query to me ) -- yes i suffered a pretty big weight loss over a 2-3 month period prior to my type 1 diagnosis at age 14.,
a gad test is a blood test which measures whether the body is producing a type of antibody which destroys its own gad cells.,
"in type 1 diabetes, a number of autoantibodies are thought to circulate including those which target glutamic acid decarboxylase.",
presence of these autoantibodies suggests type 1 diabetes.,

"anyway, i am glad you advised me to see a doctor and i am glad i will have that blood test to see what is wrong.",

she seems to know more about diabetes than the dn that i see.,

i was healthy through out my pregnancy.,
salvia said: hi @red_river_ sorry to read of the weight problem you've been going through.,
"reducing carbs was a good idea, though not supported by many gps, so perhaps expect your own gp to advise against it when you see him/her, and they may simply try to blame weight loss on the low carb rather than anything else.",
"please insist that you get tested for other things, coz it could be a number of issues that may be causing the weight loss.",
"on the other hand, when anybody reduces their carb intake suddenly, those calories would normally need to be replaced by increased fat to help provide proper nutrients for the body and to keep us feeling fuller for longer, alongside greens and vegetables.",
did you increase your healthy fats when you went low carb?,
"we've been told for many years that fat is bad for us, with the result that many people have grown up with a fear of fats, and find it hard to put aside that fear.",
there's no need to gorge on fats - just enough to ensure you have sufficient for your body's individual needs.,
hope things work out well for you.,
keep posting here; plenty of people to help you with any queries or issues you might have.,

thank you salvia for replying to me.,
i will have a mot (or mod) blood test next week to check all and everything.,
"i was luckily seen by a gp this morning and she was very good, she wanted me to have that test as she said that i might even not have type 2, that there is a grey area between type 1 and 2.",
"and if my weight keeps going down, she will arrange for me to see a dietitian, too.",
so i feel a bit better now thing has been taken cared of.,
i won't know until end of january because this test will take a few weeks to get result.,
"at the mean time, i will follow the advices lovely people like you here give me, which is eat more healthy fat.",
i had been too busy counting carbs and being worried i didn't think about calories and protein.,
"still, that doesn't explain such a huge loss in weight.",
"anyway, thank you all for your support!",
xx,
i am type ii diabetic and i have other health complications unrelated to diabetes.,
i am forty two.,
i take metformin 500 slow release twice a day.,
my blood glucose readings are around 14 no matter how or what i eat.,
my gp put it up to 750 twice a day but it made no difference whatsoever so i put it back down to 500.,
she wants me to take gliclazide but i don't want to take it.,
i am already overweight and i have heard that most people who take gliclazide gain more weight.,
my blood glucose has been around 14 for about three years now.,
"i am tired, and find it hard to concentrate and therefore find it hard to sort this out without asking for advice.",
today my gp says would i consider insulin?,
"i am aware i would have to inject myself but aside from that, what would be the benefits of going on insulin as oppose to gliclazide?",
"my diet last year was not good, i have had an eating disorder but in the last few weeks i have been eating 'good'.",
"is it possible to go onto insulin to get my 14 reading down and then stick to a healthy diet, come off the insulin and take just metformin?",
or is it once you are taking insulin you are on it for life?,
i don't know what to do and would appreciate any advice,
"hi, i've just been given a five day course of prednisolone 30mcg a day along with 500mcg amoxil 3x a day.",
took my steroids at lunch time yesterday and two of the antibiotics and woke up with my blood sugar at 7.2!,
"that's really high for me, normally a bad result would be 6.0 - i've always had a tendency to have a highish morning reading.",
"i became t2 eighteen months ago after being on a 3 month course of prednisolone for ra but i discovered lchf, bought a blood sugar meter and ate my way out of it.",
i'm really worried now that i become t2 again.,
when i was grumbling about the steroids my other half reminded me of someone we know who is t1 and whose bloods were wrecked ( i think only for a while) when he was given antibiotics.,
does anyone have experience of this and if so what happened.,
any advice would be more than welcome.,
all i can think of is to be really strict on the lchf.,
"thanks in advance, lizzie pipp said: hi @lizzie2 sorry you are not feeling well.",
i have to take prednisolone sometimes.,
as often as 3 or 4 x five day courses a year.,
sometimes with antibiotics.,
"i find that for a while, ( up to 3 or 4 weeks after) i have higher blood glucose readings, particularly in the mornings.",
"i think it important to keep to low carb diet, and to drink plenty of water, whilst taking the meds, but just accept for a few weeks bg will be higher than i like.",
the need for steroids and antibiotics is sometimes greater than the need to keep bg numbers low.,
hope you feel better soon.,
click to expand...,
thank you for your good wishes and thanks for your reassuring reply.,
"know what you mean about the need for steroids, i always felt i would never have them ever again after my first experience with them but i've got some sort of infection and it hurts to breathe in then it hurts to breathe out and when the doctor asked if i'd ever had steroids, i said that i had but i'd ended up with t2, she said this would only be for five days etc and i actually felt glad to get them knowing that last time i had them i felt like super woman.",
"i'm kind of needing to feel like that again, i've got a huge amount of stress in my life at the moment , two of the men in my family are waiting for major surgery.",
then i got up and discovered i was 7.2 and didn't feel quite so chuffed - i think i really need to chill out.,
"pipp said: yes, if you can relax and accept that for a few days you will be having higher bg numbers it will help.",
"i find that at times when i need steroids ( mine for allergies which cause breathing problems which can become chest infections) it is annoying, but i have to take time out and do nothing until recovered.",
if i try to carry on as usual i take longer to recover.,
"one thing i have noticed, as have my nearest and dearest, is that i have much less patience than usual.",
"whether that is due to the meds, or just due to me not being well, i don't know.",
"i have been known to get a bit bad tempered when taking steroid meds, so tend to avoid situations that could annoy me, and keep a low profile.",
nothing wrong with taking duvet days when out of sorts.,
click to expand...,
"i agree, you've just got to accept it and go with the flow.",
hard to tell if it's the steroids or just not feeling well.,
think i'd go fir not feeling well because i know i was feeling sore and grumpy before i finally admitted i wasn't feeling good and it wasn't improving and went to the doctor.,
a duvet day or two and a low profile - especially the low profile - shall be my aim,
a few weeks ago i was diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease.,
i've been unwell for years but drs only started taking it seriously when last summer things got from bad to worse.,
i was very shocked when the dr told me the diagnosis of some of the tests that have been done and also said but need to carry out further tests to see whether i have crohn's or ulcerative colitis??,
i've never heard of any of these conditions before.,
anyone been diagnosed with any of these?,
how are you managing it?,
i'm still very confused as to what to eat with regards to diabetes and the above?,
any advice?,

click to expand... sound advice totto.,
it's good to know that people are managing this and taking control of their lives again.,

i think i've caused these problems to myself ... through my life of being a vegetarian and eating high fibre cereals and wholemeal flours ..,

problems flared up again last summer and after recent tests it has finally been diagnosed as crohn's disease and i'm due for more surgery in a few months.,
"how are you managing your diabetes now, hope you 've managed to find a diet suitable as it's really not easy combining ibd with diabetes!",
"my bg levels are high but slowly coming down, but i don't think they'll get much better now till after the surgery and some of my inflammation has gone.",
"click to expand... hi rowan, i'm so sorry to hear that you've had all these ongoing health conditions... gosh you really have been through the mill.",
"did you find the symptoms quite different or are they similar for uc and crohn's, especially during flare ups?",
what are you eating to keep the diabetes and crohn's under control?,
are you following any particular diet?,
i too was diagnosed with ibs many many years ago.,
"during the last 4 years, ive been diagnosed with 7 different health conditions ibd is the last one.",
first appointment to see the specialist is in april and they'll be carrying out tests to see if it's uc or crohn's.,
really not looking forward to this at all.,
"i've never eaten eggs, meat or fish, so my diet was kinda restricted even before being t2 but nowadays i'm really lost... don't know what to eat or not to eat, ibd flare ups last weeks and during that time i'm afraid of what to eat.",
"last summer was the worst flare up and since then i've realised i've had to restrict even more foods... can't tolerate cold uncooked cheese but i'm ok with a little heated cheese, no seeds unless they're blended into a green smoothie.",
food seems like an enermy not a pleasure.,
"i haven't found a suitable diet for both diabetes and ibd... don't even know if is one out there.... indy51 said: if you aren't already aware, there have been a lot of success stories posted on various paleo/primal sites about people being cured and/or their autoimmune diseases put into remission by following the paleo autoimmune protocol diet.",

my tyroid and cortisol levels are okay.,
i had ferritin and vit d deficiency but they came back to low-normal after 2 months of supplements.,

doc said i am insulin resistance + reactive hypoglycemia due to this.,
he said my insulin is pretty high considering how well i eat and the exercise i do.,

thank you so much for your reply!,
"i tried really low carb and sugar diet for around 3 months, before i was diagnosed and prescribed metformin.",

it made me gain more weight!,

"lamont d said: hi, you have reactive hypoglycaemia.",
which means that you react to the food you eat.,
"welcome to the forum, known as rh on here, we have our own sub forum.",
"if you click on forums at the top of the page, then scroll down to the reactive hypoglycaemia forum and click on there you will find a lot of information about rh.",
"what is happening when you eat too many carbs or even too much exercise, you create too much glucose for the insulin, then a second insulin response is excessive and you have too much insulin.",
"you go high, then low.",
"you hyper, then hypo!",
that's what your eogtt shows.,
that is typically a rh glucose test.,
"the only way to treat rh is with diet and experimenting with a glucometer to see how you react to different foods and combinations of food, that includes drink.",
the usual suspects are carbs and all forms of sugar.,
you need to have a diet that is very low in carbs.,
"your symptoms of hunger and brain fog, lethargy etc.",
is your brain telling you to eat the stuff that is bad for you.,
"i would definitely read the low carb forum, as there is some great ideas and recipes to get alternatives to carbs.",
as with food exercise is what you can do without your liver supplementing your glucose levels without creating the excess insulin.,
you are in a viscous circle of going high then low.,
your health depends on breaking that circle.,
enough for now.,
have you a glucometer?,
i will tag @brunneria to give you the cheapest option.,

"after few long term trials and comparison, now i am 100% sure carbs and sugar consumptiom helps me to at least maintain my weight.",
do you think i still should stop eating carbs?,
i will dig into the rh forum to get more information.,

so it will help my rh too.,
this is.,

i was just trying to ose weight with that diet.,

resurgam said: doing serious resistance and cardio exercise should make you gain weight - why would you think that building muscle mass would be lowering your weight?,
i was 147 lb with a 24 inch waist in my teens - no one believed i could weigh so much but i was very active - women did not do gym work in those days.,
"a lower carb way of eating allows for most normal exercise, but high intensity could be detrimental if it lowers glucose to the extent that your liver releases everything to try to sustain it.",

"i agree with you, but seriously, no one can say that i have gained these 5 kg's as muscle mass.",
"it's obvious, and what i used to wear doesn't fit anymore.",
"that's another issue, i don't feel like the resistance work (what i do is way heavier than what other girls in the gym do) help me to get thighter and gain muscle too.",
my gym's professional trainer is very suprised too after obaerving my last 2 years.,
"i have read this may be a result of the insulin/blood sugar problem too - simply, if you don't produce energy over sugar, protein will not work efficiently.",
i hope metformin helps me on that too.,
littlegreycat said: could you perhaps give us an idea about what you were eating on your low carb/low sugar diet?,
usually you would expect to replace the carbohydrates (which include sugars) with fat to make you feel full and maintain your energy levels.,
click to expand...,
it was more like a paleo diet.,
"for example, i used to eat - breakfast: eggs, high fat (healthy-organic) cheese, 15 mixed nuts, tomatos, cucumber for breakfast.",
"- in the middle: a coffee with full milk (sometimes) - lunch: a small soup, a portion of meat (with it's own fat), a small side salad or veggies - a cup of yogurt, one portion of fruit, and sometimes 10-15 nuts if i do exercise on that day (i do exercise 4 times a week mostly)",
"hello, first post from husband of insulin dependent diabetic who seemed to acquire the condition after a road accident and fractured skull some years ago.",

regards,
i'm type 1 diabetic.,
started to get quite a lot of spots on my hands and arms last week.,
it's got worse and pretty my whole upper body is covered in them now.,
i have been to my gp who reckons it's just eczema but the cream she gave me has been no help whatsoever.,
i am going back tomorrow to see if she can try something else but just wondering if any of you have had something similar and if it is related to diabetes.,
wasn't sure if i might be taking an allergic reaction to insulin or something like that.. thank you.,
not so much pain.,
it's uncomfortable.,
a bit itchy but not to bad.,
it's just spreading everywhere now.,
i have it all over the soles of my feet aswell.. just thinking of every possibility.,
only been diagnosed for 3 months.,
i use levemir and have seen a lot of people complaining that they are allergic or that i leaves them with sore lumps..,
i have been taking antihistamines for the past week since it first started and don't seem to be much help either...,
"it's 3 months down the line that it's started but when i have looked up, some of them say that people take allergic reactions to them years after first starting to use them.",
i am going to phone my diabetes team in the morning and see what they think thank you for your comments,
i have been searching to see if it is possible to influence the hba1c test.,
"i am due an op for bariatric surgery in nov/dec and have recently found out that if my test is above 67, my op will have to be postponed until i get my average result down.",
i might add that my hba1c was at 54 until the doc meddled with my meds.,
when my daily bg went through the roof he apologised saying he didn't know how i would react to the change in meds?!,
i'll explain...,
"i was taking 2000mg sr metformin per day, leaving me controlled at 54.",
he decided to half my dose and give me 5mg of forxiga.,
"all that did was send my bloods through the roof, into their 20s and give me thrush for 3 months.",
and a hba1c of 63!,
anyway background over!...,
lol.,
"to try to influence my hba1c for my test that is due he has put my metformin back to 2000mg and taken away forxiga and also introduced 40mg of gliclazide - my daily bloods have reduced, going from 16/17/18mmol/l down to 6/7/8mmol/l in a week!",
i have my test in 10 days so based on this info i am hoping my results are good x [smiling face with open mouth and smiling eyes] ......... taken from nsgp.org...,
many studies have shown that hba1c is an index of average glucose (ag) over the preceding weeks-to-months.,
erythrocyte (red blood cell) life-span averages about 120 days.,
"the level of hba1c at any point in time is contributed to by all circulating erythrocytes, from the oldest (120 days old) to the youngest.",
"however, hba1c is a ""weighted"" average of blood glucose levels during the preceding 120 days, meaning that glucose levels in the preceding 30 days contribute substantially more to the level of hba1c than do glucose levels 90-120 days earlier.",
this explains why the level of hba1c can increase or decrease relatively quickly with large changes in glucose; it does not take 120 days to detect a clinically meaningful change in hba1c following a clinically significant change in ag.,
sent from the diabetes forum app re: could this really work to lower my hba1c result quickly?,
oh also might add that i have discovered that i have become extremely carb sensitive which is also raising my bg.,
"i have reduced my carb intake to 50g per day, eating anything else with no limits.",
to my astonishment i have also last 7lb in a week!,
lol.,
it's a shame as am struggling with this.,
"i can handle being hungry all of the time, but really do not like meat, so am gagging and eating with a peg on my nose to be able to eat enough protein to fill me up each meal.",
i now dread meal times...[disappointed face].,
i know i couldn't do this forever!,
i think the only reason i am able to push myself is because i know it's for my op!,
"at least once i've has the op, my stomach will be smaller and i will be able to cope with eating smaller, balanced meals as i won't be hungry.",
so got the post op diet nailed!!!,
[smiling face with open mouth and smiling eyes] lol sent from the diabetes forum app re: could this really work to lower my hba1c result quickly?,
i know hun and thanx for your comment.,
the only reason my hba1c was higher was because of my doc changing my medication and me becoming intolerant of carbs.,
my diet is quite good otherwise.,
i suppose i'm just really frustrated as my op could be delayed due to no fault of my own.,
my diet is the same now as when my hba1c was 54 re: could this really work to lower my hba1c result quickly?,
thought so sam thanks for that!,
"to be honest i have virtually cut out carbs and got my average blood glucose level down from 13mmol/l to 9.8mmol/l within 3 weeks (average over the last 90 days, according to my daily readings from my meter).",
"i know it differs from a hba1c result, but know things were going in the right direction.",
"last night this persistent condition was at its worst with the burning feeling on the outer sides of each leg from the hips down feeling very sore yet, to touch, the skin was quite normal.",
the outer shins to the feet was by far the most painful.,
"i am currently trying to establish whether it is internittent use of 40mg lasix (water tablet) to reduce foot and ankle oedema or, perhaps, captopril (ace inhibitor to arrest kidney damage) is the cause.",
experimenting by leaving one or both off does not come up with definitive answers.,
"i have recently increased metformin (glucophage) by 1 x 500mg to a total of 1500mg daily but, as i have been very tolerant with this, feel that it is not the cause.",
both metformin and simvastatin 10mg have been used constantly for 8 years.,
"the burning is not tingling as often described and has disappeared after a few hours but, nonetheless, makes for sleepless nights.",
any other similar sufferers out there please?,
"dear ian and catlady, as i have been on simvastatin (ian) so long and have tried going a week without using it and not being able to decide whether it was associated with the burning sensation or not, i must look for other possible neurological (catlady) causes.",
i have 100% sensation but do experience pain in my toes and fingers.,
looks like an email to my doctor is called for as my appt is not due til october.,
thankyou both for your suggestions - i do hope others may still help me.,
carol - yours came in as i was writing the above - it is certainly worthwhile checking for vit b12 def.,
as you have suggested - i am grateful.,
"rob dear catlady and doug, after writing my last post i emailed my doctor (i can do that here as i have to pay for everything) detailing the condition and asking his opinion re neurological suggestion and vit b12 and will post his reply when i get it.",
"one further concern is my bp as, for the whole of my life until a few weeks ago, was always that of a ""young horse"" quoted one doctor ha ha ha (probably told everyone that) reading 120/90.",
since going onto ace inhibitor and lasix it dropped to 90/60 which is obviously too low.,
"problem is which one (or both) should i stop/change - yes, of course i will ask him.",
thankyou mick and doug - will be back as soon as i know.,
i am back as promised.,
"my doctor seems to feel that, after 8 years on metformin (glucophage), i have become intolerant evidenced by the upset stomach and burning legs sensation even though the dose had only been increased by 1 x 500 after lunch.",
"also, as my bp was too low and affecting me when standing up (feeling faint) he has considered discontinuing captiprol for the moment.",
the situation now is that he has prescribed a half tablet (15mg) glurenorm (cliquidone) and taken me off metformin.,
the glurenorm is to be taken once a day before breakfast for one week from tomorrow.,
i am a little concerned because he has warned me to be on my guard against hypos and this is the first time i have been so advised.,
i should also mention that he suggested my muscular aches and symptoms of increasing athritis may repeat may have been caused by metformin.,
"so, if my condition improves over the next week i just might have something positive to report.",
any helpful experiences would be gratefully acknowledged.,
"re: legs on fire change of medication glurenorm i have updated my post re: ""legs on fire"" and would ask for any advice regarding being taken off metformin for glurenorm (cliquidone) especially with regard to possible hypos dear doug, thankyou for the hint/warning - i did do a reasonable google search on respectable sites and did not find any reason to be concerned.",
"perhaps i had better word it as to ""why was..........in 200?""",
let you know the outcome - it does occur to me as to how you would have known this.,
"regards, rob dear mick, sorry not to have been back before this but i did not have anything useful to report.",
i was too afraid to go onto cliquidone even as an experiment.,
"trying to establish the cause of any persistent, pain, etc., is very difficult when on an established regimen and members will probably agree.",
"problem with my legs started after coming off quinine sulphate (8 years) which had apparently damaged my kidneys - if the oedema in my legs ankles and feet is anything to go by, the specialist and radiologist were right because my heart is a1.",
i use lasix for six days and then go back on when obviously need some 4/5 days later.,
it is this which makes determining whether the use (or non-use) of this drug may be the cause.,
the other morning after 4 days without lasix i had a repeat attack of 'burning legs' although not so severe.,
specialist today offered the suggestion that it may be my tissue filling up with water which cause the pain.,
to citari who suggested simvastatin may be the cause - i thank you.,
"i did stop the statin for some 10 days and, again, i could not come to a conclusion.",
"i have gone back to 1 x 500 mg twice a day with the statin at night and, after i feel able to experiment again, i will go back onto the additional 500 mg metformin at lunchtimes - it had reduced my bg's by a respectable amount for the short time i was on the increased dose.",
i am sure i will be able to tell the difference this time.,
in any event i will report my findings here.,
"to mick again - i know i did not need the cream but, when all has settled down i will ask for the vitamin b compound you so kindly suggested.",
"regards to all, rob",
"i was dignosed type 2 about 3 years ago and taking metformin, my bs levels were always around 8 or so my metformin was gradually increased to the maximum dose, this didn't seem to lower the levels but i was ok although often tired and took naps.",
"it was so consistent that i stopped blood testing after about a year, but levels were still always about the same on my 6 monthly fasting tests about 8 weeks ago the result of my last fasting blood test came back at 12 so i was given gliclazide as well.",
oh i forgot to mention during the 3 years i did not really watch what i ate as nothing seemed to affect my bsl i would even eat bigmacs and cream cakes!,
"anyway since the high result i have been extremely careful with my diet eating nothing that i was not allowed, no sugar at all, no fats etc i had another fasting blood test 4 weeks later and the result was 18!!",
"gliclazide was increased and i carried on with my strict diet, about a week later i was horrified to get a reading of 33!",
my medication has now been changed to still metformin & gliclazide but slow release.,
"still seems to have no effect on my bsl in fact it is extremely erratic, varying between 5 and 22.",
i am so confused about why the sudden change and why nothing i do seems to have any effect.,
"i actually was taken out for my birthday and had a huge roast dinner followed by chocolate fudge sundae with fresh cream and my level after this was only 13 after 3 years the doctor asked me what had the diabetic clinic said about the change, well this was the 1st i had ever heard of a diabetic clinic but i now have an appointment at the end of this month have posted this here in the hopes i can go to this clinic armed with any relevant info that might be useful to help them and me figure out whats going on i have racked my brain to think of anything different that could have caused this, i took a 10 day course of champix to help stop smoking about 12 weeks ago, actually did great cut down from 40 a day to 4 in 10 days but the doctor would not give me another prescription because i had not stopped completely, (i have read online that champix can influence bsl) i also had bout of thrush which i cleared up with cream from the chemist, have taken much more regular exercise been eating far less and better foods, doctor said none of which could be the reason!",
"i also feel much more awake than i have for ages and rarely drop off watching tv and i don't have any of my original symptoms of diabetes its almost as if i feel better with high bsl btw i was also put on thyroxine about 3 months after the diagnosis of diabetes that medication has never been changed, although i think that i was more lively when i was on metformin only for 3 months would be grateful for any advice or views on this please thanks pam hi thanks for the reply but i have already really cut down all the empty starches, sugar, pasta, bread, rice, potatoe.... apart from one day (my birthday) i have eaten only foods that i am allowed, yes maybe occasional pasta, bread potatoes but only small amounts and not every day (get so much conflicting advice, my doctor said eat baked potatoes and pasta) what are the best foods to help lower the levels?",
also the high numbers came before i was put on gliclazide and they haven't stabalised since in fact they appear to be going up since the dose of gliclazide was increased last week nice note to go to bed thinking that i might be out of time??,
"pam either i am not expressing myself too well or you are not reading my posts, i am not feeling tired since the high bsl's in fact i am feeling better than i have over the last 3 years since i was diagnosed and i have been eating correctly for the last 8 weeks since the 1st high bsl!",
"my problem is that the bsl's have suddenly become high & erratic and i want to know the reason and what i can do to get them down, as what i am eating doesn't seem to have any effect on my bsl.",
the one time i pigged out my bsl was actually lower than after eating low carb meals pam hi yes i realise the advice given is good advice but i can't see the relevance to my circumstances.,
"today (morning bsl 11.9) i slice of weightwatchers wholegrain bread toasted with a thin scraping of flora extra light for breakfast (2 hour bsl 11.7), this was at 11am as i overlayed, no lunch as i was out until 5pm (bsl 7.7)then had 2 boiled eggs, 1 slice ww bread followed by some melon & grapes bsl 12.8.",
yesterday after the same breakfast (always the same) bsl was 23.1 yes i have a referral but not until the end of the month and am trying to gather as much info as possible before the appointment thanks pam cugila said: hi pam.,
the advice from you have been given so far has been very good.,
"you state that you are eating correctly, what would a typical days menu consist of ?",
in view of the fact that you are having these problems it may be better if you get a referral to an endocrinologist who is an expert in all these matters.,
your gp is not exactly on the ball if he wants you to eat baked potato and pasta ...!!!,
"click to expand... actually the doctor thought at first i was coming down with an infection but 8 weeks later no infection, the only infection i had a while back was thrush which cleared up in a couple of days, can we carry infections and not know about them?",
"i have only been on gliclazide for about 6 weeks but it was increased this week by the doc, doesn't seem to have had any effect on the bsl's at all thanks pam hanadr said: pam you ask about sudden changes could you be carrying an infection?",
that could make a sudden change also the pattern f deterioration you describe is typical.,
"it's what the doctors expect to happen to all t2s and it usually leads to insulin therapy, because there's nothing else left.",
"i was warned it would happen to me 5 years ago, but it hasn't.",
in fact my use of medication is now minimal.,
metformin only.,
"it's down to reducing my carbohydrate intake 8) why the medics tell diabetics to cut down on fats, when we can metabolise them perfectly well and to base our eating plan on carbs, which we cannot?",
it is madness.,
"if you have totally wiped out your beta cells with gliclazide, there will be nothing but insulin left for you, but if you still have some beta cell activity,cutting your carbs back drastically should help.",
"in any case, it won't hurt to try.",
click to expand... are you on any other medication?,
medications such as steroids can make your bg go up a lot click to expand...,
"the only different medications i have been on are champix & thrush cream grapes are high in carbs and it is not a good idea to go too long between meals as you tend to liver dump and send your blood sugars way up click to expand... i didn't know that grapes were high carb, knew they are high sugar but read that the skins are good for diabetes plus i love them what was your morning fasting level before you had the bg of 23.1?",
click to expand... 15.0 thanks pam actually have only started eating grapes since the high blood sugar using them to munch on as i thought better than m&m's or biscuits guess i had better sip red wine instead but i have read that they may be quite good for diabetics http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/03/080318094514.htm cugila said: hi pam.,
grapes are 16.5g carbs for a very small portion of around 80g weight.,
just a few grapes only.,
i love them too but i know not to eat them like i used to - by the dozen or more !!,
i steer well clear of them and cherries.,
if you want the benefit of the grapes try drinking the odd glass of a good red wine instead.,
very beneficial.,
"click to expand... hi sue and thanks i have read this on the net too and will certainly discuss at the clinic later this month, i have mentioned this to 3 doctors at my practice and none have thought it could have any bearing on my high levels but i hadn't seen the article when i mentioned it, in fact the non smoking clinic asked for my doctors approval before she would prescribe them and it was given!!",
"i started taking champix on 15th june but my high bsl was up before this at the fasting blood test on 1st june (12) , doc put me on gliclazide on 15th july and i had another fasting blood test on 21st july and bsl was 18, (prior to this it was always about 8 or 9 for 3 years)the highest bsl was on 26th july and it was 33.3 my concern is that if champix can cause diabetes how does it affect people who already have diabetes?",
"pam sugarless sue said: champix: the fda also received 544 reports suggesting varenicline may be related to a loss of glycemic control, including many cases of weight loss or gain that could have alternative causes, but also identified numerous cases of symptoms and laboratory tests consistent with new onset diabetes.",
"click to expand... http://www.news-medical.net/news/2008/05/25/38637.aspx this may or may not have a bearing on your erratic bg levels, best to discuss with endocrinologist when you see him.",
"click to expand... another point about champix is that usually the drug is only taken for 10 days as by day 10 you should have stopped smoking so its not a long term medication, if it does cause damage it must be fairly quick acting and long lasting i will indulge in a glass of red wine now and again its one of my fav drinks, i did more or less gave up alcohol about 10 years ago but still have an occasional tipple usually the odd glass of champagne or a pimms, actually when i pigged out on my birthday i had a glass of red wine too maybe thats why my bs didn't go sky high after all the stuff i ate i shouldn't have wonder if anything is produced from the grape skins alone eg some type of supplement?",
cugila said: grapes.,
"don't believe everything you read...it's not the grapes that are good for you but the skins which contain resveratrol, a compound present naturally in grape skin, can protect against the cellular damage to blood vessels caused by high production of glucose in diabetes.",
this is what you get in red wine as well.,
"so you would be better off peeling the grapes and eating the skins, or the easy way....a glass of red wine instead.",
enjoy.,

i admit i kind of stick my head in the sand and don't want to accept what i have and i forget to take my metformin (on two a day twice a day) i do not have the best diet and don't follow any low carb diet but i think with that reading this morning my eyes have been woken up and i now feel i need to start to look after myself or i will get very poorly.,
i haven't been to see a nurse about this reading yet the receptionist just read it out over the phone.,

i have decided to go out and have a last supper tonight and then tomorrow start from day one - i will try the intermittent fasting and only eat between 12pm and 8pm which shouldn't be too difficult and then look to be low carb and sugar all the way.,
its going to take some adjustment and some pain to do it but i need to do something drastic,
"okay i fell asleep around about 8.30pm i was so tired, but have woken up again at 00:30?!",
i'm still awake obviously but i am absolutely so hungry and have just tested my bloods (6.8) they were 8.1 2 hours after my meal.,
do people usually get a snack or do they try to go back to sleep?,
"i don't want my bloods to spike, just wondering whether this is a normal thing?",
to get hungry and wake up?,
thanks charlotte ahh ok i just meant cause i was really hungry but i'll just drink some squash and try get some sleep it's been like the third night i've woken up at 12/1?,
not feeling it.,
can blood sugars rise in our sleep?,
they were 6.8 at 2am now done them again they're 7.8?,
i'm super confused.,
i've not eaten anything just had some sleep and some painkillers for my back x my bloods were 7.8 2 hours after i ate my dinner.,
was around 30g of carbs.,
i usually eat cheese when i'm peckish cause i know that doesn't spike my blood sugars.,
this morning they were 7.8 went up to 8.2 in 30 mins?!,
now i've had my shake and medication they've gone up to 13.7?!?!,
i've only had squash this morning and haven't eaten anything.,
i'm so worried it's the highest they've been in a week or 2 the squash is like dilute like cordial sugar free i can't sit around and drink water all the time as its too plain for me 24/7 i do drink a lot of water though.,
"my slim shake contains no sugar, but 2g carb each shake and i have skimmed milk to go with it.",
"my shakes don't really mess around with my bloods, it's perhaps i've not been feelin too great at the moment?",
i'm on gliclazide (160mg twice daily) and metformin (1g twice daily) slow release my bloods settled down when i drove to work it was just it randomly spiked?,
unsure.,
they've gone from 6.8 when i finished work to 8.5 after i got in from eating nothing and having squash and having a bath?,
unsure.,
"i think i'm jus gonna stick it out i've eaten barely any carbs all day my body will get used to it eventually x i'm usually stuffed for a few hours after i eat tbh, and my shakes really make me full for a while after cause i drink them during the day usually when i'm busy.",
i think i've been falling asleep earlier so i've been napping not fully sleeping so when i wake up i'm hungry perhaps?,
i've tried the fruit in water thing and it didn't really do it for me.,
i don't drink fruit juices i only drink no added sugar squash cordial stuff or water.,
i occasionally treat myself to a diet coke but that's not very often.,
"i'm not counting calories i just am using these shakes to help monitor my carb, sugar intake and increase my protein intake.",
i usually eat snacks of cheese or when i eat my main meal i have full fat options as opposed to fat free types.,
i've just tested my sugars and they're 7 which is okay for me!,
is it okay to snack on cheese?,
x i just had a munch of mature cheddar from sainsburys i'm on my break from work but i've got 70g of cooked couscous (packet and weighed) with salad for tea i'm at work till 8pm i'm on a 7am-8pm shift,
is there an accurate glucose meter that has economical testing strips.,
i am a type 2 diabetic and have been having hypos recently and am testing quite frequently.,
"i thought that because i'd lost a lot of weight that my diabetes had gone as i don't have to take any medication, only to find that i now have reactive hypoglycaemia following my gastric bypass, i just want to be able to test at as low a cost as possible but i don't want to get a monitor that gives misleading readings.",
any ideas anyone?,
"guzzler said: you say that you thought your diabetes ""had gone""?",
i am not far along from diagnosis but i was under the impression that once a diabetic always a diabetic.,
"control is the best i, personally, can hope for.",
click to expand... once i'd had my bypass surgery i was able to stop taking any diabetes medication as it wasn't needed.,
i therefore thought that i was no longer a diabetic but clearly you are always a diabetic.,
"i hadn't realised that i could get reactive hypoglycaemia after bypass surgery but my bariatric dietitian says they are seeing more of it now, although it is not suffered by all that have a bypass.",
"i got free testing strips from my gp but as i am testing frequently, due to the hypoglycaemia, i don't know how many strips they are going to allow me to have.",
"hi there, i'm not a diagnosed diabetic and don't believe i am currently diabetic, but have recently been diagnosed with reactive hypoglycemia after a 5 hours glucose tolerance test.",
i've had blood sugar issues for years but only recently done this test.,
apologies i don't have all the numbers to hand but i know from memory the following numbers from my test.... fasting bs - 4.7 1 hour postprandial - 8.8 3 hour postprandial - 3.1 5 hour postprandial - 4.8 pretty much a classic hypoglycemic spike and drop.,
not much that's too alarming from what i can see and the test i'm sure will exaggerate things slightly given the pure and fast acting carbohydrate load.,
more alarming is i now have neuropathy symptoms which have developed over the course of a few months.,
"i'll be honest and say my diet has still been high in carbohydrates during this time, much of which refined.",
"i experience tingling in my feet, that 'crawling under the skin' feeling, some light numbness in the arms, but most difficult is the shooting/stabbing pain specifically in my right foot on the right side along my ankle.",
"at the moment i get about 5 seconds of searing pain, in waves of 2-3, then it might settle down for an hour or so, then occur again.",
"sometimes more often, sometimes less, but typically everyday.",
i might also feel less painful 'shocks' frequently.,
this occurs mostly in the evenings.,
"as you can imagine not only is the pain unbearable, but sleep is affected and of course the anticipation each and every day.",
i have changed my diet and reduced carbohydrates and it's early days (2 weeks) but i have experienced a decrease in numbness but an increase in shooting pains since.,
"whilst pain is more uncomfortable than numbness, i'm hoping that i might be experiencing the 'worse before it gets better' and the nerves are repairing, causing more pain.",
i'm not currently on any medication.,
has anyone been through something similar?,
i'm a little worried that i'm experiencing these symptoms without diagnosed insulin resistance or diabetes....,
many thanks!,
"greetings, i am on the cusp of type 2 diabetes and my doctor just prescribed metformin as a hopeful preventative in addition to weight that i need to lose.",
"so i checked online to see the side effects and while it's not listed as an official side effect like nausea/throwing up for example, i happen to come across a website where someone said that metformin caused their hair to thin out big time.",
i typed metformin and hair loss into google and was shocked and scared at the explosion of results with people telling their horror stories.,
"https://www.google.ca/?gws_rd=ssl#safe=off&q=metformin+hair+loss as a 45 year old, who has been lucky to still have really great hair, i am freaked out about the idea that metformin could be the thing to change that.",
"i realize that many millions of people are on meformin and any such hair loss stories might be an almost negligible side effect percentage, so i wanted to hear what people here had to say has anyone here had any hair thinning/hair loss due to metformin?",
"my doctor did say that there are alternatives to metformin that don't have any claims of hair loss, so if it was a problem - he could put me on something else.",
"but again, i would like to hear what people here have to say per your experience and what you think of the responses on google.",
thank you very much.,
hm phil1966 said: i've not noticed any issues but there is a thread on this forum from a while ago discussing it: http://www.diabetes.co.uk/forum/threads/can-metformin-cause-hair-loss.68263/ click to expand...,
thanks for the response and link - which seems to confirm my fears.,
i was hoping for the other way around and the google responses were just a very small percentage.,
"the odd thing that is the is zero scientific proof that there is any connection, which is why hair loss is not officially listed as a side effect.",
"while we were at the body worlds exhibition on saturday, i took my blood pressure... i've yet to really understand exactly what each number means, i haven't read anything yet that's made it really clear what the numbers mean.",
can someone explain it in laymens terms?!,
my blood pressure was 116/74... is that good?,
bad?,
indifferent?,
thanks!,
found this bit...,
the first (or top) number is your systolic blood pressure.,
it is the highest level your blood pressure reaches when your heart beats.,
the second (or bottom) number is your diastolic blood pressure.,
it is the lowest level your blood pressure reaches as your heart relaxes between beats.,
that explains it nicely!,
"apparently, a red blood cell can travel your entire body in 20 seconds!",
learnt that at body worlds :wink:,
somebody has just posted on facebook that prawns are high in cholesterol.,
i love prawns and have them at least twice a week.,
does anybody know if they are something i should avoid.,
"i'm glad that they are ok to eat, i didn't doubt it really but wanted some confirmation, can't find the facebook post now.",
prawns for lunch tomorrow.,
"just a mo, i had them for lunch today as well.",
"@tipetoo can't even pop round for a small snack, you rotter.",
@tipetoo bit far to come but thanks for the invite.,
"i believe there is a form that diabtics can get that gives them exemption from costs for medical treatments, if you take medication for your diabetes, is this true, and can anybody get 1, with diabetes obviously!!!",
"my mum is 83 and insulin dependant and my dad is 86 and tablet dependant, i control(or try to!)",
with diet and excercise!,
"so im not eligible for the form, but i could do with getting 1 for my parents, any ideas about how to go about it?",
thank you all for your input im not entirely sure where my parents have got this from about a form i know i was told i wasnt eligible because i dont use medication my dad has a touch of dementia too so maybe its just something hes heard somewhere!!!,
its quite possible.................wont be the 1st time!!!,
but while i have you all here!!!,
another question....................sorry to be a pest!,
"my mum has insulin injections which my dad has to give ehr daily, is there a specific time of day she should have it?",
as he just seems to do it basically when he remembers!!!!,
"many thanks 1 and all , much appreciated help",
"hello all, i am a newly diagnosed type 2 and i am following a lchf diet plan.",
"my appetite has been 'dulled' since starting to eat lchf and i just don't get that 'hungry' feeling anymore, and i feel full on less food when i do eat.",
"so my question is, should i eat when i don't feel hungry, even if it has been six or seven hours since i last ate and i am due to go to bed in an hour or so?",
"if i don't eat then that would be a very long time to go without eating until morning ( i haven't a meter yet, bought one online the other day and am waiting for delivery).",
"i have read loads of places that it is better to eat little and often, is it?",
"also i have a lot of weight to lose, around 50lbs, so that is a consideration too.",
"any advice will be gratefully received, thank you.",
thanks for your replies andbreathe and jack.,
yes perhaps it is the metformin that is reducing my appetite.,
"having a smaller appetite is very, very unusual for me as i have always been a greedy guts - especially with carbs!",
"at the moment i am making biscuits and crackers from ground nuts, butter and eggs as i miss 'bread-y' things, especially in the morning.",
which foods should i concentrate on in order to lose weight?,
are nuts and seeds ok?,
thanks again.,
andbreathe said: hello there.,
"diabetes is a very personal condition, which we all have in individual ways - although there are usually lots of similarities.",
"the good news is, there are always lots of people on here who will help you out.",
"the bad news is what works for me, may not for you.",
"so, it's the beginning of quite a steep learning curve for you.",
"your profile suggests you are taking metformin, and you say you have started to adopt the low acrb way of eating.",
jolly good.,
"metformin is known to suppress the apetite in some, and maybe that's what's happening for you?",
the great news is that could certainly help with the trimming up you say you need to do.,
"in my experience, it is good to eat regularly, although my overnight fast is often 13 or 14 hours, without any harm or i'll-effect.",
i would suggest though it is great if you can eat breakfast.,
that kick starts your metabolism and gets everything moving.,
"i don't know if you have been reading for forum much before posting, but please do have a good read around and ask any questions you need to.",
it's how we all get going.,
"i don't know what your blood scores were at diagnosis, but usually with a decent modified diet, it is possible to make significant improvements.",
"once you receive your meter, you will probably have another raft of queries, but you'll soon get the hang of it.",
welcome aboard.,
click to expand...,
"thanks andbreathe, breakfast is the hardest meal for me as i just want to drink tea in the morning.",
greek yogurt with berries and some nuts is as much as i can face.,
everyone seems to eat eggs for breakfast but even the thought of eggs at 7.30am makes me feel queasy.,
at diagnosis my fasting blood glucose was 10.4 but it had been over 8 for a couple of years before that so i should have started improving my diet and taking the metformin sooner than now.,
my gp is a lovely person but he is a bit too easygoing about medical matters and doesn't even think a type 2 needs a meter.,
i saw him again this morning and insisted on a meter and he relented and agreed to give me one.,
he thinks people become 'obsessive' about their glucose readings.,
"thank goodness for the internet and books, people can be a lot more informed about their own health nowadays.",
"thanks for you input, ellie andbreathe said: well done getting a meter from your doc.",
most of us haven't managed that!,
i don't do a great big breakfast most days.,
"the only time i have cooked is if we have people staying, we're away, or if we're having a brunch, rather than standard breakfast.",
"like you, i like plenty of tea in the morning, and i don't necessarily have breakfast as soon as i get up.",
"in fact, its usually some time later, but i do break my fast with something light.",
"i like yoghurt with stewed rhubarb, for example.",
"and i sometimes have my oily fish at breakfast, which i know isn't for everyone.",
"if you have found that the metformin has reduced your appetite, then it might be helpful to scale back your meal/portion sizes, so that you feel like eating regularly again?",
"that way you'll probably be fitting in better with family, if that's a concern.",
"stick with it, and get testing!",
how many strips a month is your doc allowing you?,
"click to expand... hi breathe, i am allowed 200 strips per months, if i want more than that then i would need a really good reason to get more.",
it works out at over six strips per day so that should be plenty.,
"i don't live in the uk, i live in ireland and the health system is very different here.",
i will try eating smaller meals to see if it makes me a little more hungry at the next mealtime.,
"thanks again for your help, ellie deejayr said: i've recently decided that not wanting to eat is a sign that i should eat properly at the next mealtime.",
not wanting to eat is a new thing for me.,
if i go without i feel lethargic and gloomy.,
"if i eat well, with plenty of fat, i feel better, more cheerful.",
"sometimes eating regularly will be out of my control, but if i just do my best, all will be well.",
"click to expand... hi deejay, eating a lot of fats and oils is something i find hard to do.",
i like to smother my veg in butter but i find oily salad dressings etc difficult to stomach.,
i will just add more fats bit by bit.,
i am the opposite to you in that i feel more lively when i am eating lightly.,
people are different.,
thanks again.,
my husband has been in denial since his diagnosis in sept 2015.,
he refuses to eat a healthy diet and drinks approx 8 units per day in alcohol.,
he has tantrums when he is reminded he can't eat the things he wants to eat.,
he gets angry and aggressive.,
he has no idea of food and nurtion starving himself to lose weight he needs to lose 4 stone.,
"he seems to play a game, he will eat and drink what he likes until about a week before his bloods then starve himself.",
he has told his friends he has been misdiagnosed and that the nurse says the gp should not have put him on metformin.,
"his behaviour is causing problems in our marriage, i want to help but he tells me to keep my nose out and leave him alone.",
"he has refused to get help, refuses to look at this website, refuses to take help and advice from my diabetic dad.",
i really don't know how much more i can take.,
hi both thanks for replying.,
my response varies.,
i gently point out that he is not helping himself but if i sense is aggressive mood i am on egg shells because he blows.,
"his dad died from pneumonia and mrsa after surgery to remove his leg due to diabetes, so he is aware of the potential consequences.",
"after getting very upset myself on saturday mornings following a week of binging on takeaways cake from druckers, fry up, eton mess all washed down with lager or lager and lime he said he would try to change.",
"but later that day he asked me if he could have cake because he said he was entitled to a treat now and again, it's not just a small piece of cake but a large slice with cream.",
"i could not believe my eyes, he strolled off to the shop window and said they didn't have anything he fancied.",
i was speechless.,
when i asked why he had asked for my permission he is gored me and walked off.,
"thank you, i have considered speaking to his gps or at least writing to him, we are at different practices.",
"he was diagnosed with gout in june 2015, he has reduced his intake of whiskey and coke he has replaced it with lager.",
thank you again for your response.,
"v hi, thank you all for your comments.",
you have all been through difficult times.,
i have written to his go now and spoke briefly to him yesterday.,
"he was shocked, he said my husband does not give any indication he is struggling.",
he does have other emotional issues going on that add to have s situation.,
but because he refuses to talk about things on top of is health issues things are getting out of hand.,
i truly believe he is depressed is moods are so bad at times.,
i know he is terrified but he will not admit it.,
i have told him i can't stand it anymore and i want to leave him.,
i have to think of my health and that of my daughter who lives with us.,
every conversation is about how unfair he thinks it is that he can't eat as he pleases.,
"i have an eye condition that has meant i have had to have my sight removed from my left eye, through no fault of my own.",
i don't know if at some point in the future my right eye may be affected.,
fingers crossed it won't be.,
"but to be with someone who appears not to care, to be in self destruct mode is difficult.",
to risk his sight amongst other things.,
i have told him my biggest fear is he will die or become so il i will lose him anyway but it has made no difference at all.,
i can't bear to look at him,
"hi there, im new to the site!",
i've made a few posts but its my first thread so treat me gently a couple of my family members have type two diabetes but they both love chocolate.,
to be fair to them they've cut it out of their diets as much as possible.,
"however in recent years more diabetic chocolate seems to be on sale, ive looked for some locally but not had much looking finding any good quality choc.",
"do any of you have any info regarding it, where to get some etc?",
"thanks adam thanks for your advice guys, they're definetely more milk than dark chocolate lovers though!",
i suppose they may have to broaden their horizons.,
"hey guys im new around here, and i was wondering what the best app for recording my glucose results is that people are using?",
i have heard that people who suffer from auto-immune conditions are often severely deficient in zinc.,
does anyone know anything about this?,
it's not something that has ever been mentioned by consultants etc.,
"i am interested in doing the zinc taste test to check for deficiency, but am not sure how accurate it is.",
"are there any dangers for diabetics, as i'm aware zinc alters your response to insulin.",
"thanks, lucie thanks for this.",
"i have started taking a daily supplement of 10mg zinc, with vitamin c (as your body cannot absorb vit c without zinc).",
"one of the reasons i've decided to start this is because my immune system doesn't appear to exist at the moment, and i've been rubbish at fighting off even common colds for the last couple of years.",
i'm not going to take any chances with any higher a dose as you can easily take too much and this also has side effects.,
"i'll definitely be researching this a bit more though as i've read that zinc can also help to lower cholesterol, and as mine has risen in the last year quite considerably i'm interested in reducing it again, with the help of a healthier diet too.",
as diabetics have a higher risk of heart disease etc i'll be doing all i can to lower my risk.,
i'd be interested to hear about the apparent effects on your bg later down the line!,
"many thanks, lucie thanks for your replies everyone!",
"since i started taking zinc & vit c i've gone from having one cold after another with hardly a break inbetween, to having one cold in all this time (and that only lasted 2 or 3 days rather than the 8-10 days previously).",
i've felt so much better in myself as well.,
it may be a coincidence but my cholesterol dropped from 6.4 to 4.8 in 12 months (although i have also altered my diet slightly to include oily nuts and blueberries which are cholesterol-eaters!),
i didn't take the taste test in the end as it proved impossible to get hold of it so i took a chance with boots own make.,
the dose is really high at over 1000% per day but it really has made a difference.,
i have been taking the tablets that you drop into water to make a fizzy squash type drink - also great for hydration first thing in the morning (if you're like me who usually waits until mid-morning to have coffee!!),
one of my better decisions!,
lucie,
hi since i began to apply the diet more weight loss again because i left almost dinner i do not like this i am afraid to fall into the problem of anemia i do all my instincts to nourish my body this 2 month i loss 4 kilograms i have 186cm and my weight now just 58kilograms.,
the size and length are disproportionate what i'm i doing for better ?,

"i think protein, especially at night, is worse than eating carbohydrates it takes a long time to convert it to glucose as the body finds it difficult to deal with it bluetit1802 said: there is no need to increase carbohydrates.",
you have a choice between protein or fats (or both).,
there is nothing else.,
maybe you aren't eating enough.,
"are you just having one meal a day, at night?",
"if so, could you introduce another meal earlier in the day?",
what about nuts and cheese as a snack?,
"click to expand... hi madame yes there is one main meal yes, eat nuts about fifty grams a day and sometimes increase the quantity to one hundred grams eat a piece or two pieces of cheese daily bluetit1802 said: if it were me, i would have another meal earlier in the day with plenty of protein and fats.",
it doesn't have to be a big meal.,

okay i will try to add one meal thank you for your help daibell said: hi.,
you need to get yourself checked out soon for possible t1 (lada).,
your body may be burning fat as it doesn't have enough insulin.,
this can be dangerous if the blood sugar starts going up and stays up (ketoacidosis).,
i would get some ketostix and check your ketone levels which will be high if you are burning fat (ketosis) click to expand... hi thank you .,
but my blood sugar daily bellow 5.4 and after meals bellow 7.4 plus i dont have any symptoms of lada slaxxfb said: do you calorie count?,

have you had any thyroid problems before?,
digestion problems?,

"yes, i also agree.",
i decided to add breakfast mainly because i do not need to lose weight but i need to adjust my blood sugar only i think the best time for breakfast is at seven in the morning my body takes enough time between breakfast and lunch,
"i was told to change it after every 9-12 injections, but is it necessary ?",
i change every second day just so its new and clean and nice.,
"okay, im not worried then.",
"seems its all different for everyone, but one for sure if it hurts or anything change.",
good.,
thank u everyone !,

x,
i have just come across the recommendation by dr bernstein to keep blood sugar levels around 83.,
i assume thats a us figure?,
it seems to equate to 4.7 in uk terms.,
is that the hba1c?,
or fasting?,
or pre-meal?,
"can someone tell me if i am correct that, if it is hba1c then it is 27 - which seems very low to me.",
"but then, i havent come across this before.",
"i thought that getting under 39 was normal, and anything under about 30 was lower than non-diabetic levels.",
"any info gratefully received but i am not a type 1......................sorry, am i being thick?",
thank you everyone.,
one more question - so is 4.7 the target hba1c number?,
"i dont think i could get that low for my fasting blood test, as i seem to be one of those people who have a liver dump almost as soon as i open my eyes.",
but as a pre-meal target its worth the attempt.,
hi i have been reading the boards for a few days following a few visits to the doctors.,
in february i had a really bad chest infection and as it had been over 12 months since my last visit the doctor did a routine mot which discovered high blood pressure and elevated fasting level of 5.9.,
as that was slightly high she called for a repeat test and hba1c as well as repeat kidney function to assess effect of the bp meds.,
the second result came back at 5.8 for fasting but she seemed very puzzled that the hba1c result was very low (didn't think to ask her the numbers sorry) and showed good control of my blood sugar.,
i am now awaiting an appointment for an ogtt but should i start taking action now to lower carbs or would that compromise the test results and give a false result?,
"previous urine test was clear, cholestrol came back as very low (yet another puzzled look especially as i am very overweight), kidney function excellent, bp meds had reduced me almost to normal levels in three weeks.",
"for both of the fasting tests i did have either the tail end of the chest infection and on the second one another cold/cough, seems the antibiotics have wrecked the immune system and its taking a while to get it back.",
would this affect the readings?,
i'm not sure how concerned i should be regarding the elevated fbg level and whether i should invest in a bg monitor to start checking whether there is a major problem or wait until after the ogtt for which there is a waiting list and i got the impression it could be 6-8 weeks before that happens.,
i have never had any diabetes symptoms or anything i could vaguely connect to blood sugar problems.,
i do tend to eat a moderate carb diet as i am very overweight and have been losing steadily on this for the past year or so resulting in a 5 stone loss so far.,
would this have masked any pre-diabetes/diabetes symptoms?,
any advice would be appreciated as obviously the doctor didn't give out too much information and i remember she got a bit testy when i asked pertinent questions about the bp meds as i'd previously worked with someone who had been prescribed ramipril and suffered several side effects.,
after the ogtt i'd like to go back with similar pertinent questions regarding the results.,
many thanks for reading thank you for your kind replies.,
"yes it was the fasting reading at 5.8, the doctor didn't give me the result for the hba1c she just said it was very low and showed good glucose control and asked if i'd been eating any different foods especially sweet stuff recently as if the two figures were totally out of sync with each other.",
"i wasn't worried about the fbg reading when i went for the test i was more concerned that the hba1c would be off the scale as whilst i had the chest infection i was existing on fruit juices/smoothies, soup and bread as i had little appetite so expected it would be the longer term test that read higher.",
weirdly the doctor doesn't seem that bothered about the weight side of things just wants all the bp/bg numbers to be within the ranges in the guidelines it seems.,
"i shall keep on with my current eating plan, try and shed some more of the weight before the test and try not to worry about it too much.",
could i ask if a longer fasting period would cause a higher fasting result?,
they advise at my doctors not to eat/drink after 10 p.m except for water but my blood tests were at 9.15 a.m. and probably the latest i ate anything was around 7.30 the previous evening which is my normal routine apart from maybe a cup of tea at around 9 p.m.,
i was wondering if anyone could answer my question;- why can't diabetics use ice packs to sooth injuries?,
i ask this because i have recently had a total knee replacement & a couple of days after my op i asked the nurse if she could give me something to ease my discomfort & she said she would go get me a ice pack but when she came back a little while later she said i couldn't have a ice pack because i am a diabetic but she did not explain why this is so i thought i'd ask on here!,

"can anyone please tell me if monster energy drink, absolutely zero is ok to drink with type 2 please",

i have a large bowl of cornflakes but if i ate less i'd have to get something else to eat a bit later!,
"wizardo said: forget the cornflakes, nothing much in them but sugar.",
wouldn't eat porridge either.,
"i eat two eggs, bacon, sausage and mushrooms, i don't get hungry on that.",
click to expand...,
"i wouldn't be able to eat that kind of thing in the morning, i like bacon but can't stand the smell after its been cooked.",
i am seeing a dietician next week so i'm hoping she will be able to help me.,
i'm finding the hours i work difficult regarding food.,
"i eat breakfast abt 8.30/9 am, lunch if i'm working at 2pm or 1pm if i'm not working, tea will be about 5.30/6 when i'm not working when i do work i don't have any tea and just eat a few biscuits maybe more cereal.",
i finish work at about 7.30pm and could not eat a meal that time of night.,
paul-1976 said: sorry to be blunt but it's meant with the best of intentions but cereals and biscuits day in-day out are a no-no for the average type 2 diabetic and diabetic complications are potentially on the cards-i believe you stated in the past that you were on insulin yet had high bg readings and weight gain problems so my advice would be to get real and accept that the carbs have to be reduced heavily in your diet as eating what you did before diagnosis and expecting a magic pill or injectable med to cover it ain't gonna happen-insulin resistance cannot be helped with a high carb-high med regime no matter what an nhs dietitian may suggest.,

i do understand what people are saying but i just don't know how i can change my eating habits.,
the fruit i do like i've read isn't good for you.,
the nuts i like isnt good for you.,
there are just lots of things i don't like.,
i work at least 5 evenings a week so i don't have an evening meal.,
i know i need to cut back on things as my hba1c has gon up to 9.5.,
it had taken 13 years to get my hba1c down to 5.8 (2012).,
i was fine on insulin just the weight gain was the reason my consultant changed me to byetta.,
i really just don't know what to do anymore.,
"i have just had my recent hba1c which was 8.8, too high!",
"its been creeping up over the last few years and my gp has given me till march to try and bring it down, a repeat ha1c will be done then and if still high then i will be refered back to the hospital.",
"i admit to having a sweet tooth, my diet seems to be the one thing that could maybe change, i'm not sure.",
"both mum and i are diabetic and we both follow the diabetes uk guidelines with our diet, but i can't help but wonder if i eat far too many starchy foods.",
"a typical day for me is as follows (this was saturdays blood sugar readings and what i ate) blood sugars on waking 9.8 breakfast gluten free fibre flakes & milk - blood sugars 2 hours after around 12.8 mid morning options hot chocolate lunch 2 slices of gluten free bread, low fat spread and usually ham or chicken with lettuce or tomatoes 1 fat free yogurt fruit pot blood sugars 2 hours after - 10.8 dinner baked salmon small jacket potato with butter vegetables sugar free angel delight blood sugars 12.1 9.30pm small glass of milk, and 1 gluten free biscuit & 2 squares of milk chocolate.",
"has anyone got any suggestions as to what i can do to help reduce my sugars, my mum is of old school that we need to follow the dietician instructions and she won't budge on what she eats but i'm prepared to experiment!",
although i confess that the odd sweet treat will prob make an appearance in whatever i decide to do with my diet.,
i also need to lose weight as well.,
i tried to do the newcastle diet but i only managed to do 2 days because the slim fast shakes really upset my tummy and i couldn't keep out of the bathroom.,
my gp wasn't smitten on me trying that diet but i was prepared to give it a go!,
"am grateful for any help, from a fed up diabetic whose diabetes seems to be controlling her at the moment and not the other way!",
hi grazer i am a coeliac hence the gluten free diet.,
"i also have to watch my intake of nuts and shellfish as i suffer from idiopathic anaphylaxis, so although its okay for me to eat a few nuts i couldn't base meals really around it.",
i'm allowed 1 tsp of peanut butter a day or 6 almonds or 4 brazil nuts - big deal i know!!,
i'm also allowed a very small portion of prawns but i tend not to go near them as they do make my mouth itchy although eating them would not bring on anaphylaxis.,
i do probably go to bed high so i prob wake up high!,
"i do like berries so this would be an easy swap to do, also i don't mind new potatoes but i guess you would only allow yourself maybe 1 or 2?",
"scarmbled eggs for breakfast would be okay, i can't make an omelette to save my life!!",
"hmm, you have given me food for thought!!",
"i admit i do it alot of starchy food, if i was looking to cut my carbs down is there a rough guide i should be aiming for?",
eg maybe 80g per day or would this still be too high?,
"thanks hi angie thanks for the tip about frozen omelettes, i might have to investigate this!",
"hi libbyloo thanks for your advice, haven't tried gf oats but will give them a go when i go shopping this sat.",
"am planning to have scambled eggs tomorrow for breakfast, an open sandwich with ham salad for lunch with some berries and not sure about dinner!",
"i don't tihnk i will be able to convince my mum to alter her diet, what the nhs and the dietican says goes!!",
if they were to give her a diet sheet with reeuced carbs on then she would follow that!!,
"all that seems to have happened to me is follow their advice, gain weight and have high blood sugars!!",
something is wrong somewhere!!,
"hi doug i take 4 metformin a day, inject byetta twice a day and i go to the gym 3 times a week, aqua aerobics 2 times a week and i take my dog for 2 long walks at the weekend.",
"i really can't fit in much more physicla activity as i leave to go to work at 7.30am and i don't get home till about 6.00, by the time i have eaten and done the exercise i can fit in its like 10pm and time for bed!!",
"i have reduced my carbs over the last few days and i have noticed an improvement in my sugars, i don't think i could ever really go low carb, but 1 slice of bread, 1 boiled potato and 1oz of pasta doesn't seem to make my sugars rise at least at the moment my sugars are not in double figures anymore!!",
thanks fiona,

"i am only 48 but have had a below knee amputation 20 months ago, i take tramadol and pregabalin.",

any suggestions?,
that's all i get too.,

the cavity hasn't developed yet so he said they will cut away the area and fill it.,
does anyone have a filling in this area?,

thank you.,
i agree there is so much to learn my head on occasions starts to buzz with all the info keep well daisy1 said: @acorncap hello acorncap and welcome to the forum here is the basic information we give to new members and i hope you will find it useful.,
ask as many questions as you need to and someone will help.,
basic information for new members diabetes is the general term to describe people who have blood that is sweeter than normal.,
a number of different types of diabetes exist.,
a diagnosis of diabetes tends to be a big shock for most of us.,
"its far from the end of the world though and on this forum you'll find well over 235,000 people who are demonstrating this.",
"on the forum we have found that with the number of new people being diagnosed with diabetes each day, sometimes the nhs is not being able to give all the advice it would perhaps like to deliver - particularly with regards to people with type 2 diabetes.",
the role of carbohydrate carbohydrates are a factor in diabetes because they ultimately break down into sugar (glucose) within our blood.,
"we then need enough insulin to either convert the blood sugar into energy for our body, or to store the blood sugar as body fat.",
"if the amount of carbohydrate we take in is more than our bodys own (or injected) insulin can cope with, then our blood sugar will rise.",
"the bad news research indicates that raised blood sugar levels over a period of years can lead to organ damage, commonly referred to as diabetic complications .",
the good news people on the forum here have shown that there is plenty of opportunity to keep blood sugar levels from going too high.,
its a daily task but its within our reach and its well worth the effort.,
"controlling your carbs the info below is primarily aimed at people with type 2 diabetes, however, it may also be of benefit for other types of diabetes as well.",
there are two approaches to controlling your carbs: reduce your carbohydrate intake choose better carbohydrates reduce your carbohydrates a large number of people on this forum have chosen to reduce the amount of carbohydrates they eat as they have found this to be an effective way of improving (lowering) their blood sugar levels.,
"the carbohydrates which tend to have the most pronounced effect on blood sugar levels tend to be starchy carbohydrates such as rice, pasta, bread, potatoes and similar root vegetables, flour based products (pastry, cakes, biscuits, battered food etc) and certain fruits.",
choosing better carbohydrates the low glycaemic index diet is often favoured by healthcare professionals but some people with diabetes find that low gi does not help their blood sugar enough and may wish to cut out these foods altogether.,
read more on carbohydrates and diabetes .,
"over 145,000 people have taken part in the low carb program - a 10 week structured education course that is helping people lose weight and reduce medication dependency by explaining the science behind carbs, insulin and gi.",
eating what works for you different people respond differently to different types of food.,
what works for one person may not work so well for another.,
the best way to see which foods are working for you is to test your blood sugar with a glucose meter.,
to be able to see what effect a particular type of food or meal has on your blood sugar is to do a test before the meal and then test after the meal.,
a test 2 hours after the meal gives a good idea of how your body has reacted to the meal.,
"the blood sugar ranges recommended by nice are as follows: blood glucose ranges for type 2 diabetes before meals: 4 to 7 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 8.5 mmol/l blood glucose ranges for type 1 diabetes (adults) before meals: 4 to 7 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 9 mmol/l blood glucose ranges for type 1 diabetes (children) before meals: 4 to 8 mmol/l 2 hours after meals: under 10 mmol/l however, those that are able to, may wish to keep blood sugar levels below the nice after meal targets.",
"access to blood glucose test strips the nice guidelines suggest that people newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes should be offered: structured education to every person and/or their carer at and around the time of diagnosis, with annual reinforcement and review self-monitoring of plasma glucose to a person newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes only as an integral part of his or her self-management education therefore both structured education and self-monitoring of blood glucose should be offered to people with type 2 diabetes.",

thank you for the information it will be a great help,
"hi there, i'm a (non-diabetic) medical student currently researching the diets diabetic patients in hospital have because it has come to my attention that, for some, it is anywhere from poor to totally uncontrolled.",
i was wondering if anyone knew of any hopsital in the uk where they had had a good experience with the food they were served: i.e.,
where they thought that they were offered food that was suitable in the context of their condition and where they thought that their diabetes was taken into account when chosing their meals.,
thanks in advance.,
"dear all, thanks ever so much for your posts, very informative indeed.",
this research was born out of an encounter i had with a patient a few weeks ago who mentioned to me that he was diabetic and was being offered all sorts of food (like cake and juice) that he thought completely inappropriate in the management of his diabetes.,
"in my hospital, this is how it works: you get a menu that you can chose from (nowhere is there any indication of the glycaemic index on the menu) then that goes to the catering staff who know absolutely nothing about your medical history.",
"if you're good at managing your diabetes, and if there happen to be diabetes-appropriate options and if the catering staff stick strictly to what you ordered, this works fine.",
but you can see that there's a lot of 'ifs' in that sentence.,
so the idea was to sound out the patients and nurses in my hospital to try to find out where things were going wrong when this was the case and how practice can be improved.,
"to that end, if would be useful to know if there were an nhs hospital in the uk were diets were managed better so that i had a standard to which a comparison might be made.",
hana dr: thanks very much for your post.,
"i was particularly interested to read that your hospital had a little ""d"" on the menu (that is not the case in my hospital and was actually a simple measure that i thought might be appropriate - though i hear what your saying about the fact that the d may in fact be misplaced).",
may i ask what hospital you are referring to?,
sid bonkers: enormous thanks for your post - i really appreciated it.,
firstly i wanted to apologise if my choice of language was/is inappropriate/patronising.,
i really did not mean to offend.,
and i can completely understand that my bringing up this issue may seem fairly nave.,
i also totally take on board the notion that there is no such thing as one sole diabetic diet.,
"patients in my hospital do receive a choice on their menu and options will be marked as v (vegetarian), hallal, contains nuts, milk gluten free etc... and some of these options must be more appropriate in general terms than others for patients with diabetes.",
"that said, i'm aware that this may well sound rather paternalistic of me.",
"my idea here was not to try to remove choice from those who manage their diabetes well but to help guide those who, for example, are newly diagnosed.",
"i hope that does not sound to condescending, i assure you it is not meant as such.",
thanks very much again to you all.,
i've just obtained a copy of this book ( see post title) from my local library.,
it's by dr neal barnard.,
"it seems to suggest a totally vegan diet and is supported by much evidence that such a diet, which is also very low in vegetable oils/fats, can make a dramatic difference for type 2 diabetics.",
"in some cases, complete reversal is considered possible.",
"does anyone have any experience of such a diet, good or bad please?",
i'm newly diagnosed type 2 (hb1c of 7.4) and looking for a way of fending off the worst consequences of doing little to manage the condition.,
"i've cut out all sugars, foods containing sugar and gone off all junk food, keeping fats down, eating lots of vegetables.",
been on this regime for approx 4 weeks.,
"lost a little weight already, exercising daily.",
feel hungry all the time though but resisting temptation.,
also want to avoid diabetes drugs as long as possible.,
any comments or suggestions appreciated.,
"sent from the diabetes forum app hi suzi, lee and dai.",
thank you for your responses and helpful advice.,
sorry the following post is rather long.,
"wanted to provide as much info as i could, both for the active respondents and for others who may be reading.",
"suzi, may i wish you good luck with the newcastle uni diet, it sounds extreme but very likely to be effective.",
i've read all of the materials on the link you provided and will consider this as a definite possibility.,
it would be worth the pain!,
i note that the information suggests that it would be possible to spread the diet over a longer period and possibly make it less arduous.,
"in case anyone wants more info on the dr neal barnard d diet, this link provides a downloadable pdf which gives a complete summary.",
there is also a complete workbook which can be purchased (please see title of the original post on this thread.,
"the book costs around 14 but the detailed pdf is free to download here: http://www.vegetarian.org.uk/campaigns/ ... report.pdf lee, thank you for your comments on vegetarian diet.",
"the d diet also banishes animal fats, including dairy.",
this is on the basis that the fat inside cells interferes with the insulin's action.,
i do not think that the book is written with a promote vegan ism bias.,
this is diet and its underlying rationale are explained in the pdf and more fully in the book.,
my current diet is a little bit of a knee jerk response to my diagnosis if i'm honest.,
"i have completely removed all junk food, sweets, sugary drinks, crisps, biscuits, cakes, pastries etc from my life, starting on the day i received my diagnosis, around 4 to 5 weeks ago.",
"i have also stopped eating bread, virtually completely, apart from occasional slice or two of rye bread or pumpernickel.",
"breakfast is usually porridge oats, real ones, cooked with water.",
"no sugar, very little milk.",
blueberries or raspberries to supplement.,
"i used to have 2 or 3 cooked breakfasts per week, bacon, egg etc.",
stopped completely!,
"lunch is salad, i've developed a pea / bean salad approach.",
"evening meal is either cooked vegetables or more salad, sometimes grilled salmon or occasionally a chicken breast but 5 out of 7 evening meals are currently salad, no meat or fish, pumpernickel bread is often added, 1 slice max.",
"i love salad, so at the moment, i'm not complaining too much but this diet is probably not great and probably not sustainable long term.",
"dai, thank you for your point about the low carbs.",
i will calculate my current total carbs intake and see what it reveals.,
"my current confusion, possibly doubt, lies with the fats.",
"i am 55, a little overweight (76kg) for my height (1.68m or 5ft 6in).",
"i also have high cholesterol (decided not to take the statins in the short term, hoping to bring level down with my change in food habit, please see earlier regarding the junk food, etc).",
"with my current, knee jerk diet, my weight is coming down and people have commented on it.",
"both the d-diet and the newcastle diet appear to be low fat as well as low or controlled carb, (in the case of the d-diet).",
i am metering bg and trying to reduce the levels.,
"my early morning fasting level is averaging at 7.3, with a go-to-bed level averaging 6.9.",
"not too sure why the waking, is lower than go-to-bed value.",
"my average post meal, 2 hour is 8.2 (breakfast), 8.7 (lunch) and 9.1 (dinner).",
i usually eat nothing after the evening meal and no alcohol.,
"i'm also walking and cycling daily, probably averaging 1 hour per day.",
increasing this and will also add swimming and also some core strength exercise as soon as i feel up to doing so.,
"to a newbie, the recommended diet thing is confusing, there appear to be many differing schools of thought about the balance of carbs, fats, proteins.",
the official guidance seems counter-intuitive to me.,
"my objective is to fight the good fight, so to speak, and to bring the diabetes under complete control, if i can.",
i acknowledge that there is officially no cure and that reversal probably only means control.,
sorry the above is rather long.,
"wanted to provide as much info as i could, both for the respondents and others who may be reading.",
"sent from the diabetes forum app very sorry, not sure why half of the text in my last post might have become a hyperlink.",
on way to fix it.,
only click on it if you want to go to the pdf.,
sent from the diabetes forum app hi carbdodger.,
you make a very good point about the porridge and the beans / peas.,
i've just realised that they contain more carbs than protein!,
"i'm trying to bring the cholesterol down, hence the oats breakfast and the avoidance of the bacon and egg, although i love the latter!",
"i guess i need low carbs and also low fat, given the cholesterol level.",
"my doctor / nurse simply said, focus on whole grain, rather than the simpler carbs and sugars but reduce carbs overall.",
"otherwise live normally, as long as its healthy.",
"i guess, i'm now looking for a number to follow.",
x grams carb per day.,
"actually, i am looking for a long term control or reverse approach.",
"my hba1c level was 7.4 on diagnosis, only a bit above suzi (see her post, above).",
she was considered pre-diabetic.,
how bad is 7.4 and can i get out of the diabetic zone?,
do you have any opinion regarding the starvation diet approach to she'd weight and improve insulin sensitivity?,
sent from the diabetes forum app hi again carbdodger.,
"just bought a copy of the collins gem carb counter, via kindle.",

sent from the diabetes forum app hi cd.,
i will take on board your advice and comments.,
"no, not had a gtt up to now.",
"i don't like the idea of a starvation diet either but with the newcastle uni diet it might actually be possible to rid oneself of the disease completely, provided that the ongoing lifestyle is healthy.",
like you i enjoy food as a positive part of life.,
the diabetes appears now to be a barrier to enjoying food.,
"food decisions now seem to dominate my life, or at least preoccupy my thinking.",
to what extent do you think the exercise you are doing is helping?,
"do you think that cure is possible, given one of these diets (new readers, please see top most posts), or is it likely to be fools golds?",
"sent from the diabetes forum app thank you everyone for your replies, the advice and comments are invaluable to a newbie :sick: .",
cathy - i was put off a bit from adopting the d-diet because it is totally vegan (not that i object to vegans or vegan-ism - i just like some meat or fish occasionally).,
"i was also surprised that the d-diet does not require low carb, only low gi/gl (contrary to most comments i've seen on this forum that suggest it is the best way to go, low carb).",
i have decided to try low carb for the time being - until i am able to control my levels and am confident that i know how foods affect me - combining this with an escalation in exercise and trying to approach normal weight for my height.,
"barbara - statins have such a bad press, trying to keep away from them if i can.",
i'm sure the press like to emphasise the problems and they are no doubt exaggerated.,
i will look into natural / plant based alternatives.,
yorkman - i think we have very similar food tastes!,
all - i think my longer term plan (6 months or so from now possibly) will be to try and go on something akin to the newcastle diet.,
"nothing to lose by it (apart from weight) and who knows, it might prove to be effective in holding off the worst that diabetes can muster :twisted: very sorry izzi, suzy and bonnie.",
"when i posted the above, i hadn't seen the most recent posts (did't notice page 2) izzi - i will continue to consider this until i decide what strict diet to adopt after i know what foods help my levels, the d-diet isn't completely off the menu (no pun).",
suzy and bonnie - you both make the point loud and clear about exercise.,
i am not doing enough and i need to change it today.,
bonnie - your diet seems to support the d-diet (apart from the meat and fish etc).,
awesome exercise record.,
will visit your site.,
"this is turning out to be a great education for me, thank you",
right where to begin.,
about 3 years ago i started getting a very dry mouth which led to me drinking oceans of whatever there was available normally pop from the fridge.,
"during the day i hardly drank anything, it was after i'd come in from work and started to make tea.",
i could drink 1 1/2 pints of orange while making tea and another 1/2 pint with my tea.,
"then while watching tele, about another pint until i went to bed which was around 10-10:30 pm.",
during the night i would get up religiously every 2-2 1/2 hrs for a wee and this went on for about 3 years until i had my heart attack on the 14th nov this year.,
whilst in hospital i was diagnosed type 2 and was given metformin along with about 6 other tablets (listed below).,
since day 1 of taking these tablets i have been going to bed at around 12pm and not getting up once during the night.,
i sleep right through till about 8am.,
has anybody else had a similar experience or does anyone know if any of the below tablets are the reason for this?,
sancho panza said: i would think that as your sugar levels have come under control and with the metformin that why you no longer need the toilet at night.,
it's one of the common symptoms and was the reason i took myself to the drs like you i was up every couple of hours and constantly thirsty but after getting my sugars down and with the metformin its a thing of the past even if i have had a drink.,
i was a great fan of fresh orange juice too click to expand...,
"cheers sancho, glad to see it wasn't just me.",
sancho panza said: no defiantly not just you prior to diagnosis i would drink at least a litre of still pop during the night click to expand... is that all !!,
"sumobabe said: you're lucky if you were getting to sleep 2 to 2-1/2 hours at a stretch: before my diabetes was diagnosed, sometimes i was getting up every hour, sometimes even more frequently.",
"and the urinary frequency wasn't just at night; i had to urinate so frequently during the day that it interfered with everything, even going to the grocery store.",
i was just diagnosed less than a month ago.,
"i'm making dietary changes and taking metformin, and i've already noticed a difference in how frequently i have to hit the loo.",
"i must say, it's a very welcome change!",

"hi, after an ultrasound scan i have found out i have gallstones (quite impressive ones according to the operative :lol: ) just got back from gp and she is going to refer me to hospital with a view to having the gallbladder removed .",
has anyone had theirs removed?,
"how did it go, how long out of action?",
i go to the gym for an hour twice a week and don't want to have to spend weeks out of it and have to get my fitness levels back up again.,
"i thought that they could be broken up, but apparently this only applies to kidney stones that are then flushed out of the system, but with gall stones (she says) they would just lay in the bottom of the gallbladder like a sludge.",
anyone got stones and just left them and if so what side effects did it have?,

"im convinced that one or both of these are causing me to have irregular bowel movements (if any at all) stomach cramps and a severe lack of sleep, if anything i feel more tired and sleep in the day.",
is any of this things normal?,
i take 2 metformin and 1 gliclazide twice a day.,
i also must mention i've begun the lchf diet.,
i have suffered from reactive hypoglycemia nearly all my adult life but have always been told that sooner or later it will turn to type 2 diabetes.,
i have always been careful with my diet and mostly all has been good.,
for one reason or another i had a chicken caeser burger in a bun and a few fries from burger king.,
2 hours later i felt awful and my blood glucose was 12.9.,
does this mean that i have diabetes?,
i know i should make an appt to see the dr but am really scared about this.,
it has never ever gone this high before.,
any advice would be much appreciated.,
thank you.,
hi there new to this so apologies if there is a more dedicated thread.,
"i do not have diabetes, but i am on a ketogenic diet as i am quite obese and this seems to be a good way of life for me.",
i had my cholesterol and blood glucose levels checked today after being on a lchf diet for 3 months.,
cholesterol was 4.99mmol and glucose level was 1.3mmol.,
"from my reading, 1.3mmol is very low on a ""normal diet"", and indicates hypoglycemia, but is this to be expected on a keto diet?",
a bit in the woods and just want to ensure i am not doing something harmful.,
thanks in advance!,
"hi all, thanks for the responses.",
that is what was showing on the device and what was written down on the chart.,
feeling 100% so not sure what the deal.,
may call them and ask them to recheck.,
"def not in a coma or dead got it rechecked, 4.4mmol.",
"nurse said she wasn;t worried as i was fine, no shaking or any signs of a hypo.",
getting another fast check done in the am.,
hopefully not an issue.,

"ringi said: very low bg reading with no visible health issues have been reported when people 'eat' very high fat (including their own), with limit protein and few carbs, it is not normal, but does happen.",
"the body can ""learn"" overtime to live on ketones.",
personally i would be increase the carbsa little .,
"click to expand... hi thanks - this might be the case as i have really axed the carbs, and the pharmacist did say that some people are out of normal ranges but cope well regardless.",
i'm going to increase good carbs and keep an eye on this.,
"you guys got me a bit worried, thought i was circling the drain!",
"take care bulkbiker said: can you tell me your definition of ""good carbs""?",
if you want to achieve weight loss i would caution against increasing carb intake too much.,
there are a few reasons for this 1.,
eating more carbs may well cause further carbs cravings and hunger pangs 2.,
loosing weight on keto is usually assisted by having low insulin levels so you can access your body fat for energy rather than insulin triggering fat storage.,
eating more carbs may cause raised insulin.,
3,
4.4 is a perfectly normal level so i wouldn't sweat it 4.,
"the 20g per day ""carb limit"" is generally thought to be where we could all maintain nutritional ketosis which is what you are aiming for.",
increasing carbs could knock you out of ketosis.,
i'm sure there are others here who will disagree but as someone who has lost a fair bit of weight first by going lchf then a keto way of eating i will just share what has worked for me.,
hope that helps a bit.,
"click to expand... hi i was just going to up my veg intake, (aubergine and courgettes) and possibly some coconut milk.",
i'll go back to using my app to record carb intake so i know the values i'm getting to ensure i'm around 20g a day.,
"i know often i'm around 10g, which is prob the reason it was so low this am?",
"i may have been overdoing it more ""no carb"" than ""low carb.""",
i guess any changes will depend on what tomorrows reading is after another fast (as requested by pharmacist).,
hopefully it'll be normal range and the 1.3 was just a calibration blip.,
"at the mo i have no carb cravings or hunger pangs, and down to eating 1 normal meal and 2 lighter meals a day.",

"my 2.5 year old daughter woke up for the loo, i thought it smelt pungent so dipped it with a ketostick.",

"i'm in a total panic, i'm t1 have been for 10 years but neither of my children had any signs/symptoms until now.",
"i will recheck her urine again next time she goes, it's unlikely it'll be tonight as she usually sleeps right through she had mince and potatoes for dinner around 5.30 then had some veggies and waffles off her daddy's plate an hour or so later, followed by a muller yoghurt and rice crispies just after 7ish...",
"the smell just reminded me of when i've had ketones, at diagnosis and when i've been unwell, that's what made me dip it catapillar said: have you tested her blood sugar?",
"she won't like it, but i probably would be testing her blood sugar pretty instantly.",
because if it is diabetes related you need to know so you can get her to hospital.,
hopefully a test will show normal blood sugar and you can breathe a sigh of relief.,

has she been drinking enough?,
also did she have any problems or winged when she passed urine?,
was the smell slightly fishy?,
if so it might be an infection.,
if you have any concerns with a child it is always best to get it sorted and checked out.,
try getting a clean sample tomorrow dip it again if still possitive and take her and it to idoc or a&e.,
if your concern lessons then i would take her to gp on monday with a sample just to get checked out and put your own mind at rest.,
"maggie click to expand... hi maggie, yes she's been drinking often and enough.",
her urine was clear and not too concentrated.,
the smell reminded me of when i've had ketones which set alarm bells off and caused me to check it with a ketostick.,

"one of my friends has recently been told she is 'pre-diabetic' and so she is taking this very seriously, changing her eating habits in various ways, cutting back on obvious things, ie sugar in tea/coffee, not eating cakes, desserts and such like and she's doing very well, it seems.",
"the diabetes nurse, that she has seen for the first time, was apparently surprised that my friend had had hba1c tested but not a fasting blood sugar and that her diagnosis was made on the basis of the hba1c only.",
the nurse had apparently explained that a fasting blood sugar would show what her blood sugar levels had been over the past 3 months!,
"i said i thought she must have meant hba1c but, no, she definitely wants my friend to have a fasting blood sugar test when she is due a re-check in 3 months, ie march 2018 now, i was under the impression that it was now acceptable to diagnose on the basis of hba1c rather than requiring a certain number of random blood sugars and/or fasting blood sugars.",
i just do not understand this and wonder if the nurse is confusing the tests or just 'out-of-date'.,
"however, i don't like to assume i know more than the nurse can someone explain this, please, or are you as confused as i am now???",
many thanks hi all i'm so sorry.,

i have looked at that web page and the only symptom i have is pins and needles in my hands which i mentioned to the diabetic nurse 6 months ago.,
i also take multi vits which include folic acid i just checked the ingredients.,
maybe its a side effect of taking metformin?,
it was just the general diabetic blood test.,
never seen a doctor since diagnosed .,
only a diabetic nurse who says i only need to see her and when i went last week said only once a year now.,
good advice in getting a print out will ask wednesday.,

"freema said: have you been taking vitamin b12 lately, usually it is the other way around, like vitamin folic-acid can mask a vitamin b12 deficiency, but maybe the two can interfere with each other if taken in very high amounts.. years ago i read a lot of books from the hand of a finnish vitamin/nutrition scientist; one thing i remember is that he stated that the lungs need a lot of folic-acid to be in the best ""shape"", so i would guess that if one has had a cold or influenza maybe ones body uses more folic acid than other times, also the folic acid is in higher amounts in green foods and liver and to lesser degree in milk in the summertime where plants are getting the best conditions and the same about cows grassing and other animals feeded with green foods... folic acid has its name from the word ""leaf"" in french, where it was first isolated from as a vitamin... vine-leaves are filled with folic-acid..",

i left her at the tram stop at 11-30 quite coherent but then i have no memory until i was at a tram stop 13 miles away from where i should have been.,

then on sliding scale if higher than 140.,
she was diagnosed 5 years ago type 2 but turned brittle 2 years ago and is now considered type 1.,
my brother was type1 since age 15 and lasted through 3 kidneys and 2 pancreas for 45 years.,
last year sugar would never come down even with iv insulin and in end because of gastropernesis could no longer stabilize.,
that is our worry now wiyh my mom.,
yes i was just talking with dr.,
need to get with her diabetic dr and get a number for how many grams she should stay below.,
thank you to everyone who stayed close with help and advice while my mom was running high.,
"she ran from 350 - 512 for about 3 days then on morning i first wrote she woke up at 400 with slurred sporadic speech, extreme weakness, and very disoriented.",
your advice to get her to hospital was spot on.,
"turns out she had an infection and was immediately given two doses of strong antibiotic through iv, along with iv fluids.",
after day and half in hospital level came down to low 200 and we brought her home at 10pm last night.,
she was given info on diet and told no more than 40 carbs per meal.,
"before this incident she never paid attention to carb.intake, only sugar.",
i would like some feedback if anyone has thoughts or knowledge on the subject.,
".... the last year of my brother's life (he was juvenile diabetic type 1 as compared to my mom who is considered type 1 because of brittle diagnosis) he fought hard every day to keep sugar levels as close to low 200's as possible, but inevitably would get to where he was in hospital one week each month for iv insulin to bring levels down.",
this continued for year until end.,
my question is...when my brother would go on he was immediately put on iv insulin and usually ended up staying 5 days before levels were under control.,
"when my mom went in just 3 days ago, they immediately did iv fluids, but never once did the doctors even talk about using iv insulin.",
they just treated the infection and did not seem concerned at all that sugar levels stayed high 200's - 360 while being treated .,
in fact i had to show them the sliding scale for number of insulin units avcording to each blood reading.,
"it's been a year since my brother's experience, but have ideas changed about how to treat high levels?",
when she went in with dka in august she was treated with iv insulin whereas my brother was always treated with iv even though not dka.,
any ideas?,

not good.,
post-snack bg was 225 mg/dl (12.5 mmol/l).,
i haven't had a reading that high since i started eating low carb in february.,
i was in shock.,
"all i could think of is ""how long is it going to take to get my bg back into the normal range?"".",
"but to my surprise, pre-dinner (2 hours after the high reading) my bg was 179 mg/dl (10 mmol/l).",
"then 2 3/4 hours later, post-dinner bg was 125 mg/dl (6.9 mmol/l), a 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l) drop in a little less than 6 hours.",
"after this, i ate a whole avocado.",
my post-snack/pre-sleep bg was 143 mg/dl (7.9 mmol/l).,
fbg this morning was 135 mg/dl (7.5 mmol/l) so still not back to normal.,
"i find this interesting, because after i started eating low carb, it took me 21 days to get my bg down to 125 mg/dl (6.9 mmol/l) for the first time .",
"i believe, thanks to the lchf diet, i'm less insulin resistant now.",
that's good.,
"my questions: if i'm less insulin resistant now, and i'm producing adequate insulin, why are my blood glucose levels still stuck in the 115 - 135 mg/dl (6.4 - 7.5 mmol/l) range for the last 3 months?",
it's as if my body thinks my normal fbg is 115 mg/dl (6.4 mmol/l).,
how do i change that to 85 mg/dl (4.7 mmol/l)?,

"yes, i've definitely plateaued nosher8355.",
"what got me thinking more about this, after reflecting on what happened, is a post i read recently.",
the poster was a type 2 diabetic.,
during a meeting with his/her healthcare provider it was observed that his/her blood glucose (bg) levels were higher than they'd been previously.,
"in response, it was explained that sometimes the body's set point for bg gets stuck at a higher than normal level and that switching to a different medication sometimes returns the bg to its previous, lower levels.",
i find this idea interesting.,
nosher8355 said: sometimes your pancreas needs a kick in the arse to get it moving again!,
click to expand...,
yes.,
but then maybe no.,
"i'm speculating, but i think i'm producing enough insulin and i think i've come along way in reducing my insulin resistance too.",
so what else is at play here?,
"another question that i'm trying to sort out is ""why are people who do the whole foods, plant based, low or no fat diet that includes whole grains, starchy vegetables, and legumes as successful as those who do the low carb, high fat diet?""",
"from what i've read, their blood glucose drops too after a few weeks.",
"nosher, i feel like the child who's always asking the exasperated parent, ""yes, but wh-h-y-y?""",
"brunneria, your range of 5 - 7 mmol/l (90.1 - 126.1 mg/dl), though a lot better, is similar to mine, 115 - 135 mg/dl (6.4 - 7.5 mmol/l).",
it helps knowing that at least one person shares my experience.,
i do empathize with your hypoglycemic episodes.,
"i suffered with hypoglycemia for a number of years in the early 80's, and don't want to ever go through that again.",
i also had a bad temper.,
kept food available at all times.,
"if forced to choose, my preference would be pre-diabetes over hypoglycemia in a heartbeat!",
"i think you're dead on in your statement, ""our bodies get habituated to a certain bg range.",
"and it drifts back into that range, when bgs stray above or below.",
"in order to get habituated to a new, lower range, is harder work than just staying where you are.",
"i think habituation takes several weeks at the new level before you fully adjust.""",
i also think there's something to what you say about getting the bg down and keeping it there for several weeks.,
i hadn't thought about that until i read your post.,
that's essentially what @ian dp did.,
"his bg was so high, they had to medicate him to get it back down.",

yesterday i attended my annual diabetic review at my hospital hospital name removed .,
"i was greeted by a new consultant, and following a very limp handshake he skimmed over the usual questionnaire, skipped the parts about checking sensation in my feet etc, then announced that, having been diagnosed type 1 in 1995, with an hba1c of 7, there was nothing more the hospital could do for me, so i am being discharged into the care of my local surgery.",
"i explained i did not want this to happen, as follows: - my annual review is the only opportunity i have to discuss diabetes with someone qualified in diabetes - i live in a small rural village with a very poorly managed local surgery, not close to my place of work - whilst my hba1c has been constant, it hides many highs and lows, and i have just had the worst and most difficult year of diabetes management since diagnosis 16 years ago.",
"my protestations were ignored, and i have been discharged from their care.",
"i`m guessing that it is now down to me to contact my local surgery, and try to negotiate with them to test my blood for me as regularly as i would like (ie quarterly of half yearly), in the meantime, thank you technology for the internet, as it will become my diabetes support team from today!",
"anyone else been dropped by their hospital, or is it just hospital name ?",
"thanks, that sounds like good advice.",
"i also kind of agree to the principle of health professionals focussing on priorities, but it wasn`t really ""sold"" to me like that...",
it was cheap of me to name the hospital...but cheap of them to discharge me.,

i have had a very bad cold/cough for about 3 weeks.,
i noticed that my vision was getting a bit blurred over the weekend but got worse on monday.,
i went to the hospital and took a blood test which showed my reading as 27+.,
my reading has never been anywhere near that high before.,
the hospital checked my urine which contained a high level of ketones (not sure exactly what that is).,
i was given insulin on a drip which reduced my blood sugar to a reading of 9 the following morning.,
i was put back on metformin and given gliclazide.,
my sugar reading in the evening roses to 22.,
this morning i was given another medication sitagliptin as my blood sugar remained high.,

jim brunneria said: aha!,
we posted simultaneously!,
hi nosher.,
"click to expand... hello, thank you for your reply.",
"what does ""low carp to meter"" mean?",
how do you do that?,
"brunneria said: hi it means that i bought myself a home blood glucose meter (available at boots, on ebay and amazon), and test my blood glucose regularly.",
so i can tell when my blood glucose goes too high or too low.,
it also means that i can work out which foods cause those rises and falls.,
"since we are all unique, my reaction to food is going to be different from yours, or nosher's, or anyone else.",
"it has taught me to avoid bread like the plague, that i can eat potatoes as chips but not mash, and that berries and cream is a much better desert for me than icecream... that kind of thing.",

click to expand...,
"thank you, it looks like i'll have to get a meter.",
nosher8355 said: before meds i had a list as long as a foolscap piece of paper.,
i hope you have started to read all about rh.,
the top and bottom is you eat carbs and sugar and you hyper and then you hypo.,
which if not treated means you will suffer even more symptoms or maybe hospital.,
you will have to eat or drink something that is low carb and not full of sugar because if you high carb or too much sugar you will hyper and hypo and yo- yo your bsls.,
"you will have to test food to see what effect it has on you and if possible avoid bread, potatoes, pasta, pastry, rice and anything in milk.",
cereals are just full of sugar.,
only have diet drinks.,
you will eat a lot of meat and veg.,
eggs are good.,
salad is good but no dressings.,
no beer but some wines are ok. fruit is another food group that you have to be careful.,
have small pieces every couple of hours.,
berries are fine.,
watch out for tropical fruits they tend to spike you more.,
you may have to eat up to 7 or 8 small meals a day.,
this will keep your bsls around normal avoiding carbs and sugar.,
cheese and butter is fine.,
greek yoghurt is fine.,
fish is good.,
when you have your meter you will test for all of the food that you like.,
i would recommend using saturated fats to cook with.,
eat as much as fresh food as you can.,
control is the key to living with the condition.,
have you been referred to an endocrinologist he will help you?,
ask away!,
have you any help at all?,
are you on any meds?,
click to expand...,
thanks for getting back to me.,
i have a question for you about symptoms.,
i have been keeping a log in regards to food/liquid intake and how i feel.,
my light headedness has been pretty constant throughout the day.,
"i wake up fine, but after about an hour or so, start with the light headedness, my arms and legs tingle, and i get very fatigues as well.",
this goes on pretty much all day regardless of what i eat.,
these symptoms go away around 3:00 in the after noon and don't come back until the next day.,
is this symptomatic of rh?,
jim nosher8355 said: once again @brunneria has summed it up perfectly.,
i had light headedness but in the evening after i had bounced around all day.,
it was my consultant that gave me a diagnosis and the no carbs no sugar diet!,
small plates eightish times a day.,
hypos at night etc wake up ok until after a couple of hours then a lot of different symptoms.,
this is not meant to hurt or scare you but if you have a meter and your willing do a fasting test.,
if you are rh!,
once you start fasting your bsls will normalise 4-6 mmol.,
and as long as you fast it will not drop or go up!,
it's only when you eat that your bsls will move.,
you can take sips of water.,
i have done 4 days.,
never budged below 4.,
what meds are you on?,
have you been referred?,
what are you eating and drinking?,
click to expand...,
thank you very much for this information!,
it looks like i'm experiencing similar symptoms.,
i'm trying to figure out what i can and cannot eat.,
can you eat whole grain breads?,
what about milk?,
"i had my thyroid gland removed 20 years ago, and am on levothyroxine.",
"other than that, i'm not on any other meds.",
i'm trying to set up an appointment to see an endocrinologist this week.,
was really upset tonight.,
i tested 6.2 before i ate then 2 hours after i ate i was 19.3 and feeling dizzy gliclazide only been 3 days but it had been coming down jacket potato i had sliced ham which was 1 percent sugar.,
and handful of cheese and onion.,
i just don't understand it all still.,
i never drink sugary drinks or eat sweets and i have all these diabetics telling me you can have the odd treat but i have one jacket potatoe and all hell breaks loose??,
i took it about 10 minutes before and i was taking one in morning and one at night now nurse told me to take two was not crisps but thanks for the advice.,
i am really upset by all this as my diet is not bad.,
my friend had diabetes and eats all sorts and smokes excessively.,
i have abstained from almost everything since diagnosed at the weekend xx trying not to be i am active and diet is not bad.,
so does this mean i will never even be allowed a treat of does my medication need to change xx ok am just crying now i can't do this.,
"hi all, i did another test after 3 months.",
today my result is 5.8 %.,
three months ago it was 5.6% is that mean i am getting worse?,

but i am still worry.,
from 5.6 to 5.8 getting higher.,
please advice.,
"dear all, thanks for your comments.",
i feel better now.,
"hi everyone, my question is does anyone else taking statins suffer hair loss.",
"my hair has always been quite thin and although i suffer from hypothyroidism and have been through the menopause i am sure that the simvastatin is causing my alopecia, it comes out in lumps when i wash it.",
i do use a hair thicker which does cover it up but costs 15 a tin and i can see the problem getting worse as time goes on.,
i don't want my lipid profile to increase as a result of not taking a statin but i am seriously thinking of stopping.,
"any advice, many thanks, debra x hi guys thanks for the replies, viviennem, duane graveline does have alopecia listed.",
"noblehead, i have looked in the bnf and all statins have this side effect.",
"sue 02, i think i am in for bad time then, at the moment dm is controlled by d/e only but if hair loss is a side effect of metformin, great.",
i am already on levothyroxine and a beta blocker.,
"i will make an appointment with my gp, who is very good but of course simvastatin is recommended by nice for type 2's again, thanks for the replies, debra x many thanks viv, i will stick to my guns!, deb x well everyone i went to see my gp today and basically he said that it could be anything thats causing the hair loss because i am on so many medications, beta blocker, calcium channel-blocker, levothyroxine.",
"anyway we agreed that i stop the simvastatin, no statin at all as they all cause alopecia and go back for repeat bloods in january and review the situation, so hopefully my hair might be better, debra x hi daisy1, i have sent a pm to energize, but my hair loss is all over the top of my head and i now use mane hair thickening spray (just google it).",
"it costs 15 per 200ml can but does last for ages and completely camoflages hair loss and if you order 6 you get one free, best wishes, deb xx hi to everyone who is interested in this thread.",
i went back and got blood lipids tested again in january after being off simvastatin since august 2011 and low and behold serum cholesterol 7.7 and ldl 5.4 so am going to re-start taking simvastatin tonight again.,
as i said i am already on beta blocker and levothyroxine due to hypothyroidism so not much i can really do about it.,
"i did have my calcium and ferrititn checked also and they are ok, so hair loss not due to parathyroid gland or low ferritin levels.",
"i may see if i can go on atorvastatin instead but in bnf it states that all statins have hair loss as a side effect and of course it may all prove to be post menopausal, oh the joys of getting older!, debra x hi to everyone again, i re-started the simvastatin last week but i went back to my surgery today and saw a different doctor, who was very nice and sympathetic.",
she said that she didn't doubt for a minute that it was the simvastatin that has been causing my hair loss and that i was to stop it immediately and to commence a fibrate called fenofibrate 267mgs od.,
"it was just so good to see someone who seemed to understand and didn't just dismiss it as ""getting older"" and ""after the menopause"".",
so i will take it daily and report back in due course to you all.,
"stay healthy, debra x hi everyone, i can now report back on this subject and to let you know that whilst my thinning patches are still that, obviously once the hair has gone it is gone forever.",
i can report that no more is falling out when i wash or comb my hair so i am pleased with the result and would recommend that anyone who is having the same problem and thinks that it is due to their statins to go and see a sympathetic doctor and ask to switch to a fibrate instead.,

"i felt light headed last week and quickly treated it as a possible hypo, i ate a hard candy sweet and half a sandwich.",
the blood glucose reading was 7.9 after 30 mins.,
my question is can you feel hypo even if your blood sugar is above 4.3?,
and should be treated like a hypo even if the reading is above 4.3?,
thanks in advance for your help.,
tim2000s said: i've noticed that if my blood sugar is dropping rapidly from within a normal range (<8mmol/l) i can feel it.,
the symptoms are not quite the same as a hypo.,
having the libre has given me the opportunity to identify this better.,

was fine soon afterwards as soon as i ate the sweet and sandwich.,
"thanks for the libre tip, i'll look into it.",
"ohitsnicola said: if my bg is say lower than 5 and i still have active insulin in me, then yes i get the symptoms but sometimes i think it could be psychological because i know i am going to be hypo...like for instance i could feel fine sometimes...test and be about 3.2mmol and then once the realization is there, i then have all of the symptoms!",
click to expand...,
thanks nocola although i am t2 but a lot of what you say applies to me.,
i think i might go hypo but my meter says otherwise.,
and usually i am fine.,
ione of the doctor's blog i read said that diabetes can not cause hypos it is almost always the medications.,
for example metformin can not cause hypos !,
pss brunneria said: there's a phrase i've seen used in a couple of studies on reactive hypoglycaemia.,
"the phrase is 'relative hypoglycaemia' it describes the experience when blood glucose drops sharply, to lower levels than the person is used to.",
"they then experience hypo symptoms, even if the blood glucose doesn't fall to true hypo levels (below approx 3.6 mmol/l).",
"here in the uk, we often call the experience a 'false hypo', but i much prefer the term 'relative hypo' because the symptoms are very real, and very unpleasant.",
definitely not fake!,
as to whether it should be treated... well i think prevention is better than cure.,
"so i like low carbing, because if your bg never swings high, then it can't drop sharply, hard and fast enough to produce a relative hypo.",
hope that helps.,

so i guess the trick is to avoid spikes.,
it must be very hard to achieve on ongoing basis :-(,
have been told by the specialist nurse to start on metformin 500ml twice daily for ten days then to increase to three times daily for another and then up to the final dosage of four tablets after a further ten days.i am reluctant to take the medication at all but if i have to i would like the dosage to be as small as possible.if a dosage of two tablets shows any results(as in my daily testing) why should i increase the dosage until i really have to?,
may i know the drug interaction/effect when taking aspirin & metformin thanks so much for the attention.,
"i'm taking low dose aspirin & 1500 mg of metformin for 2 weeks now on a daily basis, so far have not experienced any problem.",
just trying to find out if any member has had encountered adverse effect doing the same.,
i am continuing my intake of low dosage aspirin and 1500 mg of metformin (3/day after meals).,
"i'm consuming meat, pork, 1 boiled egg, low intake of carbs, blended vegie combo of cucumber, celery & okra & of course regular exercises.",
"my bs readings for the past 3 days were 102, 98, 94 respectively and this morning it was 90 mg/dl.",
i will reduce my metformin intake to 1000 - 500 mg/day if my bs contunue to drop.,
i am a recently diagnosed t2.,
my bg was about 21 at diagnosis a about 8 days ago.,
i have brought it way down via keto diet and its now running between 6 and 8 depending on time.,
"so over the past few months ive had nerve tingles in my hands and feet which i expect, but also near the groin area, especially when peeing.",
the groin tingles went away pretty quickly once my bg went down but i just felt them again and im at 7 presently.,
is this normal?,
is this an odd place for tingles?,
what does this mean?,
im also feeling them in random places in my legs and arms but not all the time.,
thoughts?,
im not freaking out but also i am.,
thanks for any insights.,
iban said: i too am t2 and was diagnosed october 2017 after years of cold tingling feet but it was a very itchy groin which took me to the gp where t2 was confirmed.,
i have opted to see an endocrinologist this month in order to get to the bottom of my symptoms.,
i went to buy a blood glucose monitor and was told by the chemist that it could be provided by my gp on prescription but the surgery later told me that not for t2 as there is nothing to be done if readings are extreme.,
"good luck to you, windover.",

i got a meter and test all the time so i can monitor my bg.,
i have found it to be invaluable.,
changing to a lchf diet has brought my numbers down.,

hoping this continues.,
also taking b-12 and magnesium.,
i would suggest to pick up a meter.,

"hi all, from my previous post:- being aggresive with serious hypo's http://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes-forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=12399 , i mentioned that i was going to see a diabetic welfare specialist, today @ 10:20.",
"when being seen, she asked for the nature of the visit.",
i tried to express my concerns regarding my insulin & would like to be transferred onto animal insulin.,
"i did not even have a chance to finishing off saying what i had written when she interupted me & said, ""the diabetic consultant would probably not agree to changing you onto animal insulin"" ""it may be something simple like adjusting the dosage or poor control"" she stated hypoawareness can appear in longer term diabetes (which is true) but disagreed it could be related to the lantus insulin.)",
"and so on..... after she said this, i said to her that when booking the appointment, it was stated by the receptionist, that the consultant would be coming into the practice.",
"she replied, well, i am the diabetic care nurse & give general advice but i am not in the position to question about insulins or change them!",
"i then asked, although i am the patient using this medication, surely i am allowed to have a choice of what insulin i can be on.",
"she replied, it is up to the consultant.",
(that was the whole idea of the visit!),
she then requested that i had to have my hb1ac blood test done.,
i was all for it.,
"then i had my weight checked, feet examined & blood pressure checked.",
all was ok. she said that she has booked an appointment for me to see the consultant in a months time.,
"i made a request to her, saying i would like it sooner if possible.",
she agreed.,
some advice from you please.,
"as i really want to give animal insulin a try, mainly to get my awareness back & stop feeling lifeless, etc, can anyone recommend the best way for me to reinforce this fact to the upcoming meeting with my consultant?",
many thanks for your time in this matter.,

do we have rights anymore?,
"hi sue, many thanks for your advice.",
"as it goes, i have an appointment with my gp on monday 25th jan, so i will raise it with him.",
"cheers, steve hi barb, well done to you, great work on your part.",
i have my appointment for this thursday to get of lantus & try & go onto animal insulin.,
great news again.,
"regards, steve",
hi everyone in october last year i developed oral thrush following a very high dose of penicillin for a very bad throat infection.,
eventually in december my gp did a throat swab which came back positive for thrush so was given flucloxacillin along with another week of oral nystatin.,
this appeared to clear up.,
however i am now sure that i have it again - have started taking acidophilus again but my mouth is so sore and uncomfortable.,
does anyone know of any other treatments which will help me deal with this.,
having checked on the internet i definitely have the symptoms - my tongue feels like it is burning most of the time.,
"i know you are all going to say that it will improve when my sugars are under better control but i always defy ""normal""!!",
during the past 2/3 weeks my sugars have improved but i have been eating more fruit over that time also (i dont usually eat fruit because of my ibs).,
i know certain foods aggravate it so can someone tell me which foods please?,
i only have thrust in my mouth - no problems at all anywhere else!,
thanking you all in advance.,

"great not only is my husband diabetic now my little westie is to just wondering if anyone else has a diabetic dog my dog was diagnosed last week, it happened suddenly, he just seemed suddenly to get very very slow and have no energy as well as urinating at night in the house.",
"i have to injected him 12 hrs apart every day with insulin, so i feed him at 8am and 8pm and give him his insulin poor dog is miffed as he was always fed at lunch time and he looks for his dinner i f you have a diabetic dog please do post as i am feeling rather alone and there isnt any forums on the web at all andrea i am feeding him raw natures menu in the mornings he has boiled chicken breast and in the evening rabbit and cranberry it seems very hard on the web to find good information about controlling dogs blood sugar levels but even with 2 insulin shots aday nearly every morning he is lethargic and slow, perks up in the afternoon and evening before he is fed again",
"hi everyone, i was diagnosed three months ago with hba1c6.8 and c- peptide 5.2, as a type 2 diabetic.",
"i am male 27, height 165 cm.",
weight at the time of diagnosis was 75kg now reduced to 68 kg..,
immediately after diagnosis i made good lifestyle changes...,
"started to read a lot about diabetes on internet ..no meds, started low carb diet, completely avoided all forms of suger, refined carbs, fruits, starchy vegetables, n packeged n junk foods.",
n started brisk walking 4 to 6 kms everyday.,
"i was consuming 120 to 140 gms carbs, 80 to 110 gms of good fat and 50 to 80 gms of protein everyday.",
regularly started monitoring bgs on glucometer.,
n based on all glucometer readings i estimated my hba1c to be 5.8.,
(use accu chek active glucometer) but surprisingly my latest hba1c was 4.6.,
i was doubtful about lab accuracy.,
so i did full blood work from another lab.,
still again hba1c was 4.6. fasting 72 n pp 99.,
"and all other reports lipids, hemoglobin, thyroid function, kidney function, everything was normal.",
now my doc says i am not diabetic or was misdiagnosed.,
"what do you people think was i never diabetic, or am i just good controlled???",
thank u,
i have been administering humilin 70/30 for the last 10 years.,
"on my request, recently my doctor put me on novomix 30 recommending the same dose as of humilin 70/30.",
"in the past by using humilin 70/30, i had hypos, and bg was somewhat sometime under control especially during the evening time, but novoflex has not shown me any sign of hypos, also glucose level is not coming under control.",
i am very much worried about this.,
any of my friends on this forum can educate me what are possible reasons and what should i do?,
thanks in anticipation for your valuable input.,
"thank you ebony, i will try to explain as under:- novomix 30 : 32 units in the morning (before breakfast), 30 units in the evening (before dinner).",
my usual breakfast : at around 7:30 a.m. 2 or 3 slices of bran bread with little margarine (cholesterol free) and 2 or 3 times a week one boiled egg with a cup of low fat milk daily.,
at around 9:30 a.m.,
i drink one cup of tea or mild coffee with milk.,
lunch : chicken/meat burger composed of bran bread with one small apple or an orange.,
"dinner : 2 brown breads with vegetable curry or meat with salad consisting of tomato, carrot, cucumber, onion.",
readings : fasting always around 150 - 200 mmdl and random around 200 - 225 mmdl.,
i am diabetic for the last 30 years.,
protein in urine has made me worried.,
hope the above will assist you in advising me what to do?,
thank you once again!,

i've used 2 different sensors so far as per the instructions which say that it has to be inserted on the upper arm.,
i don't want to keep inserting it there while the weather is hot though because i don't like it being visible in sleeveless clothes.,
does anyone know why it says you can only insert it on the upper arm?,
i can't work out why it couldn't be out on the lower back or another flat place... any insight would be appreciated and if anyone has tried putting it somewhere else i'd like to know how it went.,
they're so expensive i don't want to try it and it go wrong!,

"i have normal blood glucose levels (below pre-diabetic), but it took going keto and carnivore to achieve that.",
low carbing in the 30g carbs or above range had my blood glucose levels in the pre-diabetic range or above.,
during the last few years i have trialled both berberine (and more recently metformin) but neither seemed to offer enough benefit to outweigh the gut consequences - and the hassle of remembering to take the dratted tablets.,

thanks all for your replies....,
"i spoke to my diabetic nurse recently, who i asked the same question... she told me that the consultant suspects that i am actually type 1 late onset, which she said unfortunately means that i may never come off insulin... after continuing my exercise however and after buying umpteen lo carb cookbooks (all i found were useless as if they are lo in carb they seem to be high in fat!",

"i'm having a big problem getting my head around this, so i'd appreciate any experts on here who can clarify things for me.",
"i finally got to see a 'diabetes nurse' a few days ago, and i found our conversation very frustrating (and unhelpful).",
"she wanted me to just accept that i now have diabetes, on the basis of two readings of my fasting bg taken weeks and months ago.",
"she didn't exactly say that they constituted valid diagnostic criteria , but she did say that my bgs would never get that high unless i were diabetic.",
so let me accept that as a starting point.,
i must be diabetic if i had two high fbg readings in the past couple of months or so.,
ok.,
definition accepted for now.,
"next, what would be the diagnostic criteria for me having ceased to be a diabetic?",
"i've encountered this 'diabetic for life' approach, according to which you can never stop being a diabetic - you can only hope to get it under control.",
so let's suppose i do get it under control (and i seem to be doing so already).,
but that seems a bit ridiculous.,
"unless there is reason to say that permanent and irreparable damage to my system has manifested the diabetes, as for example if my pancreas packed up for good, there has to be at least a logical possibility of eliminating the condition.",
"suppose, for example, i were to recover my health to the point of having completely normal bg readings for the next year, living a healthy lifestyle with no meds.",
wouldn't that constitute no longer being diabetic?,
"the prevailing view seems to be that once a diabetic always a diabetic, but if that just means that once you have produced two high readings they are not going to be forgotten, what is the point of that?",
"ok, so the central point is that there are enduring, defined, physical disorders that render someone as an ongoing diabetic.",
that's fine - totally comprehensible.,
a pity my gp practice didn't manage to explain it.,
"so even if i need to continue with a very strict diet and exercise regime, i will regard myself as healthy.",
what would happen if i were to adopt a different lifestyle is not too important to me.,
thanks.,
"yes, i've had the carb diet from my nurse already, and as you will know, it is in the official nhs leaflet.",
"it doesn't make any sense to me either, and i am frankly dumbfounded that the nhs just seems to blindly hang onto it.",
"there's a great series of videos (five parts) on youtube here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrhkk5l7 ... playnext=6 what this guy explains is all what i thought already, as a matter of common sense.",
my high bgs developed because my lifestyle was appallingly unhealthy - regular drinking and zero exercise.,
it doesn't follow that it is not reversible by way of an appropriate readjustment in lifestyle.,
"certainly, it is possible to re-establish healthy bg levels with diet and exercise (i've already done it), but further, i don't see any evidence that the insulin resistance is irreparable either.",
"by the way, i am equally sceptical about the nhs's motives for pushing the carbs.",
"i taught medical ethics at postgrad level for a number of years, and my degree of scepticism got worse the more i looked into it.",
it comes down to greed and profiteering.,
money and integrity make rare bedfellows.,
http://www.cchr.org/cchr-reports/invent ... ction.html http://www.amazon.co.uk/selling-sicknes ... 286&sr=1-6 plenty of interesting material to read.,
just do a search for 'inventing sickness / disease / illness' i think that seems to be about it.,
"but the irony is, of course, that they are not, in fact, normal.",
they are the levels of carb intake foisted upon us by the modern food industry.,
the 'low-carb' diet we are all trying to maintain is very similar to the diet of our ancestors - the diet we evolved with.,
"so for anyone who is successfully managing their bg levels by diet and exercise alone, the answer to the question ""so in what sense am i still diabetic?""",
"appears to be, ""in the sense that your bg-management system can't cope adequately with the junk diet most people have.""",
"no, i wasn't saying such d&e successes are non-diabetic ; just that their diabetes amounts to a surviving inability to manage excessive levels of carb intake, as southerngeneral6512 suggested.",
"if that inability is attributable to a damaged pancreas, though (as a separate point), i also wonder whether it is true that a damaged pancreas is incapable of regeneration.",
"the liver is self-repairing, for example, and a biochemist friend of mine has explained to me that: it might be one of three things.",
> the first is that you are not producing enough insulin ( the hormone > that stimulates cells to uptake glucose).,
"if this is the case the > pancreas (islets of langerhans) may be active but ""lazy"" and need some > stimulus to allow you to produce your own insulin.",
"as you rightly observe, we are all at our own stage of the disorder, but for someone who is still able to manage a controlled intake of carbs it might well be that the pancreas can still be 'kick-started' back into full functionality.",
"at this point i am speculating, of course, but my point is just that it would be premature to give up hope and resign oneself to a lifetime of medication.",
"hi there, i'm a newbie to the site, diagnosed (with type 2 they think, though still waiting on a couple of tests to confirm absolutely that not type 1) about 8 weeks ago.",
"immediately cut out all sugar and followed patrick holfords low gl diet for first 6 weeks, then last week or so have altered slightly to follow the blood group diet (i'm an o - which means i'm meant to eat a lot of meat, but am pescatarian).",
"anyhoo, this is the second q i'm posting today as second thing that's really confusing me; i've pretty much ate the exact same thing for the last 4/5 days, but in the last two days, my readings are going high two hours after my breakfast and dinner... where as before it was ok... any idea why this might be...??",
"i've not been sneaking in a chocolate bar in between ;-) i've only had a meter for around ten days so appreciate it's early days, but just really confused that i thought i'd found a 'safe' breakfast and dinner, but now both are coming up as between 10 and 14's two hours after eating.",
"my lunch seems to be fine still, and i'll drop back down to about 6.5 after, but was 10.7 after last nights dinner and it was still 10 fasting this morning :-s my last hba1c was 7.5 and my blood sugars are *usually* around 8 on waking, then can go down to 5ish or up to 14ish throughout the day.",
"i am not very overweight, but definitely have excess belly fat which i know it's considered the worst place to store fat.",
"i am female, 36, and bmi of 23.",
i'm feeling a bit disheartened today so any tips muchly appreciated....,
thanks daisy thanks for the tips - i haven't felt particularly more stressed and ate pretty much exactly the same meals/portion sizes - but - i did have a terrible nights sleep on tues and then quite a long day yesterday - and i'm guessing from what you've said this could affect things?,
"posting reminded me to see if the various antibody tests they took were back yet, so just rang dr's and they were: all normal so defo type 2 apparently... which at least means i'm a little bit clearer on what i'm addressing if nothing else haha, i can see the headline now: 'high winds cause chaos with diabetics across the uk' :-d thanks for the replies - its all learning...!",

"hello, recently went to the chemist to pick up a prescription of accu chek multiclix lancets and i was told they have been discontinued and i was to go to my g.p to get an alternative ...",
i don't have another lancet device so the nurse gave me some unistix to last me till monday ..,
i phoned accu chek and was told that they will send some but would take up to 10 days and i asked why is it so long and they said it's not an emergency item but was told that the doctor could prescribe accu chek safe-t- lancets but my doctor isn't happy to prescribe them ...,
i would have thought since i am on insulin treatment and i have to test that i would have been at least been given some lancets ..,
i am unsure what to do as i don't have many left ???,
"any suggestions thanks for the offer anne very much appreciated, was more wondering what to do long term as they have discontinued the lancets and doctor is not willing to prescribe different ones.",
have got an appointment monday with a different g.p but unsure what to ask for does any one know any lancets that are single use but is a device its self rather then a needle at the end of a stick?,
thanks again though anne i have been told by the chemist that the lancet devices only come with machines by the and should ask for single use lancets like these ones : i have been told to use the ones that have a needle on the end of a stick but they are really painful scotty57 said: what about contacting roche and asking them if they can send you a new one.,
i now use their fast clix device (which is supposed to be the least painful one to use).,
it also has a drum with 6 lancets in it but it is smaller than the multiclix.,
click to expand...,
so do you think they would do that then @scotty57 i have had a lot of trouble with my doctor before - when i was first diagnosed i was given a letter to take to my gp to get a repeat prescription and it said i needed to test 6-8 times per day but apparently he thought that's too much and should only test 4 times a day ...,
went saw another doctor and problem sorted,
is there any correlation between ibuprofen and raised bs levels?,
"of course, my level of pain at present could also be responsible.",
alisonjane10 said: hi lynn1 i suspect that the ibuprofen is not the cause of raised bs.,
it's most likely that the stress upon your body due to pain & inflammation is actually the cause.,
"keep well hydrated & if the ibuprofen isn't managing to control the pain effectively, or you have breakthrough pain, then another visit to see your gp is necessary.",
your doctor may want to combine the ibuprofen with an analgesic or increase your dose.,
"ibuprofen often causes gastric disturbances, so i do hope your gp has prescribed you something to protect your stomach....something like omeprazole or lansoprazole is the usual first choice.",
i hope you feel better very soon.,

alisonjane10 said: ouch!,
"yes, i am aware just how painful this procedure is.",
i'm afraid orthopaedic surgery can be brutal on the body.,
"pain will usually be worse on the second or third day after surgery when the anaesthetic and strong medication wears off, and youll probably need strong painkillers to control this.",
without them itll be difficult to do the exercises needed to strengthen your muscles and restore mobility.,
"you haven't said how long it is since you had your procedure, but you're clearly still experiencing a great deal of pain/discomfort.",
the knock on effect is resulting in higher than usual bs levels.,
you could do without this added worry in my humble opinion.,
"as i said in my earlier reply, if you're having breakthrough pain, or your pain management isn't effective, then you need to get back to your gp to discuss what other pain relief is available to you.",
"hopefully, you'll also be seeing a physiotherapist for assessment & appropriate treatment.",

"formed a great bond with my physiotherapist last time and have already started my hydrotherapy sessions, followed by gym work.",

what would you recommend?,
"thank you lovinglife said: my none diabetic friend used an electric one and it burnt her foot, like one of those chinese burns you used to get as a kid but far bigger!",

help or advice anyone of you lovely people ?,
ang,
had a result of 86 which i told dr's receptionist meant nothing to me.,
can anyone identify what this actually equates to ?,
have an appt to see diabetic nurse but have to wait a week.,
also been told have an albumin reading which is a ' bit ' high.,
again any advise would be appreciated.,
"went to dr's initially with pains and tingling in my arms, especially in the early hours .",
had a lot of blood taken for various tests to establish why.,
doesn't seem any urgency to act according to receptionist and am still nonr the wiser.,
dr will call me at 6pm at my request tonight.,

i am 54 and have lost 20 lbs over the last 18 months.,
still about 2 stone overweight.,
i am guilty of not exercising and do drink more than recommended as i feel so fed up.,
i have read it is not good to drink with metformin ?,
i have asked several times for a monitor so as to gauge my sugar level responses to the food i eat but get the same old replies at surgery as i have read on this forum; main one being that constant monitoring is bad for us as we then dwell on the problem.,
"i really must start the tablets as i am beginning to feel really under the weather, some of this being stress from my boss/work and the worry that i am not helping myself.",
have felt extremely low for a couple of months now .,
anyway enough of my moaning.,
its good to have support from you all.,
will try harder and feel a little more positive today.,
hello i have been diabetic (type1) for the last 18 years (diagnosed at 16yrs).,
when i was about 28/29 i started to have night time hypos which were eventually resolved with a reduction to my long acting insulin.,
during these episodes i would eventually come to or awake the following morning in a completely wet bed (literally as if i wet myself or spilt several pints of water on the bed).,
im now well controlled but the night time hypos still happen maybe once or twice a year and sometimes i cannot attribute it towards anything obvious (one happened last night).,
"my wife often assists, and administers a glucagon injection to resolve the situation.",
she says that during the episode im tossing and turning and drooling excessively (she cannot administer any glucagel).,
"however my main concern is when these episodes happen i do not wake up at the onset of the hypo, and if i'm on my own could i possibly choke?",
my diabetic team never heard of drooling during your sleep when someone has a nigh time hypo so they could not advise why this happens.,
"is this common, excessive salivation during hypo when one is not awake - assume i'm lacking coordination due to the hypo and is the reason of the excessive salivation?",
"however i will salivate enough liquid to cover single bed sheet, and ironically when this happens and im on my own its the wet cold sheets and pillows that have brought me around.",
"many of you will know my posts regarding leg cramp, etc., and that i would have won the olympics if such an event existed for the most severest type of cramp imaginable - and, on one occasion, causing unconsciousness.",
"also, you will have observed a tirade from me if any mention of quininine sulphate was prescribed because of the damage it has done to my kidneys.",

having members say how good magnesium was i always thought i had a last resort and the time has now come for me to enjoy that.,
off to the apotek (chemist in your language) i went - a national chain to boot - and confidently asked for 375 gm tablets of magnesium.,
"they stared at me as if i was a confused bule (foreigner) and, after looking through the book, - an entire listing of drugs available in indonesia - looked at me with a sympathetic smile - ""not available in ind"".",
will those that posted their preference and usage of magnesium please confirm whether the 375 gm tablets were pure magnesium or actually magnesium supplements?,
"to my mind these boxes of vitamin supplements are a very expensive 'con' and, as the prices here for such items are astronomical, i do need to know.",
i should add that supplements with magnesium included are available here but one never knows the mg weight of each constituent or whether the product is bulked with less expensive chemicals.,
"your help would be gratefully received, rob i opened my post on the forum this morning and it was just like christmas !!!",
thankyou so much for your three very valuable replies.,
believe it or not i just did not give ebay a thought regarding supply even though i buy all of my test strips on their site.,
i suppose citrate and sulphate are the same.,
"i also have fallenstar's 'new' idea (at least i have never heard of it) which is malate but i do not quite understand ""source naturals"" - is this a product name?",

i am now off to do some experimenting.,
"regards, rob thankyou fallenstar, i will search amazon with the info you gave me.",
with the other members' suggestions i can probably mix n' match to make a full-time recipe.,
i am very grateful because when these cramps come on the whole lower body on one side goes into seizure - you can imagine the funny looks i get when sticking a leg out at right angles or standing up when on my motorcycle they must think it is a motogp stunt ha ha ha.,
"with best wishes, rob",
hi all i posted 2 weeks ago about how i had been diagnosed glucose intolerant but wasnt convinced i wasnt diabetic.,
well yesterday i went for a 2 week check with the nurse at the surgery.,
i had also recieved a letter about one of my many test results asking me to speak to someone about them.,
"i took a water sample with me to check that i still didnt have a water infection and mentioned the letter, and was told it was because the blood taken at the hospital was 10 and my cholesterol was high, i knew this anyway as they told me when i was at a&e.",
"i mentioned to the nurse that i was having symptoms of hypo and hyper attacks and that if i was just glucose intolerant, from what i had read i shouldnt be, and she said that from the hospital test i was actually diabetic, she took a hba1c sample, told me to carry on monitoring as i had been and recording what i had eaten and how i felt in my diary and come back in 2 weeks,and to eat small meals every 2 hours including some carbs as my pancreas was still working, but was getting sluggish so by eating i would kick start it into producing insulin, that was yesterday.",
"today i woke up got ready for work, tested my blood and ate a bowl of shredded wheats with skimmed milk, then went to work, by the time i got there i was feeling ""high"" so i tested my blood and i had shot through the roof, i tested again as i felt like my sugar had gone down and it had, but half an hour later i felt like it had gone back up and it had, which totally confused me, at 11.45 i had a fruit cereal bar and a ryvita with philidelphia light, then at 12 before i left work i had another one, by this time my sugar had dropped.",
when i got home i had 3 ryvita and 4 little skippers brisling fish in tomato sauce from a tin.,
"i was so concerned i called the pharmacist as i wasnt sure what to do, and he told me to eat normally, but i need to see the nurse asap, my fingers were clean and i dont think my machine is playing up.",
"what do i do when that happens, as i felt really rough but wasnt sure if i should eat or not.",
and should this be happening?,
here are my readings.,
7.0 @ 7.29 am - waking 7.30 am - ate mini shredded wheat and skimmed milk started feeling odd 12.9 @ 8.48 am - arrived at work still feeling odd 10.3 @ 9.29 am felt like sugar was rising 11.4 @ 10.02 am 10.1 @ 10.28 am 7.4 @ 10.51 5.3 @ 11.54 ate 1 fruit and cereal bar and 1 ryvita with philidelphia 5.7 @ 12.13 drove home 13.00 - ate 3 ryvita with 4 skippers brisling fish.,
"i know this is a lot of readings but i was worried and wasnt sure what was happening, and im still not.",
can anyone help??,
so what do i do to try and bring this sugar down when it goes up like that?,
am i actually diabetic from that?,
will eating when high have any effect (as in kick my pancreas into insulin production)?,
"thanks, thats kind of what i was thinking, i was just at a loss as to what to do at work today, so had to ride it out and felt pants in the mean time.",
"the nurse told me that my pancreas is working, its just not producing insulin all the time, which is where the small regular meals is meant to help.",
"i guess it is more common sense than i was thinking it was, but then i didnt know what i was thinking when i felt bad.",
"i didnt think i was actually meant to get low or high symptoms, a friend has told me im not ""bad"" with them levels, but she is badly controlled and on insulin.",
i know you're not doctors but i'm hoping someone can help me i was on statins from about oct 15 until november 16 as my cholesterol was high.,
i stopped because the numbers were better and i didn't want to be on them having found out what they can do - and can't!,
i understand they can increase the risk of diabetes - is that right?,
apart from anything else.,
got my latest blood test results today.,
and a phone call from the surgery asking me to come in to see the doctor.,
my hba1c has dropped from 41 in may to 38 - it was 43.2 in feb last year so that's why i'm being checked.,
i was pleasantly surprised as i thought that was why i was being called back.,
"but my serum cholesterol has gone up from 4.9 in may this year to 5.4 which is over the limit of 5, my se non hdl cholesterol level has gone form 2.8 in may to 3.4 which is over the limit of 3 and my serum urea level has also gone just over the normal limits.",
i've been eating low carb as much as i can but i have put on 7 kg over the last year - mostly due to a family wedding and also eating to relieve stress.,
i do not want to go back to statins but the doctor at the time i said i wanted to come off them said it depended on my results.,
i have patient access online to my records and after that consultation under the heading 'problems' it says declined statins!!,
"along with prediabetes, when i had it, hypertension and all the rest.",
"my question is - can i politely decline statins, or am i risking my health?",
and if so what do i say to the doctor to convince him it's not dangerous?,
"also, am i eating too much protein and that's affecting the cholestorol and the urea?",
"i know it's not the fat - although somebody on hearing my results said they were not surprised, implying it was because of all the fat and butter i've been eating.",
hope someone can help.,
thanks thank you both!,
my hdl was 2 and my non-fasting triglycerides were 1.6 - thay didn't ask me to take the test fasted.,
my cholesterol/hdl ratio was 2.7 does that help?,
"it's more awkward as the doctor is a family friend - the other doctor in the practise that i could go to is, surprisingly, very pro-statins, despite being happy for me to try lowcarb.",

clearly a 7kg weight gain is not down to a wedding.,
your comfort eating will be a bigger issue.,
if your gaining it means your eating more than your body needs.,
the lchd is not eat as much as you can its eat until your comfortable.,
cut back a little on the fats and protean.,
see how that does over a week or two.,

i don't have any heart issues.,
what is the statin you're on called?,
i was on atorvastatin.,

cutting back on fat and protein is worth a try - thanks!,
bluetit1802 said: the total/hdl should be under 5.,
so yours is good.,
your hdl is very good.,
the higher the better.,
your trigs would possibly have been lower had you fasted.,
next time make sure you fast even if told not to.,
there are 2 standards for trigs.,
fasting under 1.7 non fasting under 2.3 so your trigs are also good.,
the important ratio is the trigs/hdl which ideally should be under 0.87.,
yours is 0.8.,
"(uk measurements) doctors still look at the total, but really this is old news.",
"the total is a total of the good and the bad, in other words hdl+ldl+46% of trigs (uk measurement).",
as it includes the hdl (good stuff) it will always increase if the good stuff increases.,

thanks for explaining all this.,
maybe i can convince him that if the ratio is good i can hold off on the statins for the moment.... do i need to reduce the ldl and if so how?,

bulkbiker said: great that you don't have any heart issues but please be careful with cutting back on fats and proteins especially do not replace these with carbohydrates.,
my own cholesterol has gone up but do i care?,
no way.,
my trig hdl ratio is pretty stable at 0.8 which i am quite happy with.,
if your doc is using a total cholesterol number to advise you on taking a statin then i'm afraid he is about 20 years behind the times.,
well done on reducing your hba1c to non pre-diabetic levels.,
if you want some extra ammo to use just remind him that one of the side effects of statins can be raised blood glucose so why would he want to undo all your good work?,
click to expand...,
thanks for the support and the ammo!!,
i understood that the protein should be about a quarter of a plate but the fat should be increased to replace the carbs which are cut right back.,
and low carb veg should be eaten in large quantities.,
is that correct?,
"i have been eating quite high quantities of protien, more than as above, including snacking on it, so maybe it is too much.",

my levels are sky high but i care not a jot because i know i am now comfortable with my diet and i know that cholesterol levels take a while to normalise (for each individual) so even though i choose not to take a statin i know my levels will return to normal levels 'for me'.,
"also, when experiencing weight loss this can skew your levels until your weight stabilises again.",
"as to the suggestion up thread about cutting fats and proteins, if you are already lowering your carb intake then you lower your protein and fats you are going to leave yourself hungry and then you will be tempted to cheat on carbs.",

i am on metformin 1000mg twice a day.,
"since being diagnosed i have made significant lifestyle changes, lots of exercise, cut out all junk and fried food eats lots of salad and fruits.",
my sugars are now in very good control.,
recently i have noticed that my morning errections have dissappered and that when lying down my errections subside and dissapear.,
its extremly frustrating.,
i am in my early forties.,
could this be due to the diabetes or the medication?,
any pointers would be greatly appreciated.,
thanks thank everyone for the advice.,
i will be seeing the doc.,
it wasnt easy posting this.,
i have felt sooo let down by this as i have made magnitude changes to my lifestyle.,
thanks for sharing - much appreciated.,

click to expand...,
it doesn't feel like a hypo i feel fine i think it's high i've read on the internet that it's could be call fight or flight?,
or when my blood levels have been high for too long,
i'm recently diagnsoed as type 1 diabetes.,
i am currently taking 10 units of levemir long acting insulin with my pre-dinner novarapid dose at about 6:30 in the evening.,
for the first week after my diagnosis my levels seemed to be levelling out all through the day but over the past 3 days i have been getting low sugar readings at about 10 am in the morning (3.8-4.3).,
this is about 3-3.5 hours after my breakfast insulin.,
my pre-bedtime readings have been slowly dropping over the past few days and last night i awoke at about 2am with a sugar level of 3.3.,
do i need to drop my levemir to say 8 units in the evening?,
my sugar reading at 2hours after eating all seem to be good within 6-9.,
any advice welcome.,
thanks andrea i spoke to my dsn and she advised me to lower my morning novarapid a little and to reduce my evening levemir 2 units so hopefully that will sort me out!,
"thanks hi again, followign everyone advice i lowered my morning novarapid dose and also my levemir dose that i take with my evening meal.",
however i'm still low before lunch (4.1) and yesterday evening i dropped 5 mmol (8.3-3.3) within 1.5 hours of eating.,
i hadnt eaten anything particluarly different from other evenings or done any physical exercise so am a bit confused.,
"is my body making its own insulin when i inject, is this the infamous honeymoon period i have read about??",
should i continue to lower my doses?,
"thanks for all your help, really appreciate being able to talk to everyone about this!",
andrea makes absolute sense as i couldnt make head nor tail of what was happening with my mealtime sugars.,
i've lowered my levemir dose and i'm getting much better consistency now.,
i guess i need to keep a close eye on this as levels are likely to change when newly diagnosed?,
but i definitely feel much more in control now!,
"thanks everyone, its really great to be able to ask and get advice, mch appreciated :thumbup: just a quick update.",
after reading all the info i lowered my levemir dose and am now taking 7 in the evening.,
this seems to be working really well for me.,
my pre-meal levels are have been consistently between 4.5 and 6 mmol and my bedtime about 7.,
this means i've been able to monitor my novarapid doses better and i'm finding i'm only up to about 7- 8 two hours after eating.,
"so for now, all seems to be good...althgouh i know this is likely to change so i'll keep an eye on everyhting but now i feel like i'm much more able to understand what is happening.",
cheers,
"hi all im struggling with some ongoing medical issues, i've been tested for diabetes but my results came back fine.",

first a little history i was diagnosed type 2 in 1995 and had good diet control and over a few years i had to start taking tablets for control and in 2007 had an operation and things went a little crazy and i ended up having to control my sugars with insulin.,
in november last year sugars went crazy for no apparent reason and i was admitted to hospital (17 days).,
blood sugars are still on the high side and i have to take on average 24 units of rapid prior to any meal and 50 units of lantus at night at present sugars vary from 5 - 11.,

"hi, i am new to the forum and came on here because after christmas (when i had been eating too much rich food) my blood sugar went up to 9.5 and the diabetic nurse said i must get it down between 5 - 8.",
as the result of me halving my portions at meal times i am now reading 7.7 (this is not consistent) sometimes it is a bit lower e.g.,
7.2.,
"i take 2 gliclazide 30 mg and two 500g metformin first thing after my breakfast, i was told to take another metformin at night but found i could not sleep and got a pain in my pancreas area, consequently i stopped taking this dosage and in doing so found that it made no difference to my first reading in the morning.",

it's not that far away so take heart.,
"switch to low gi foods, brown rice, pearl barley and things like pumpernickel and, limit your portion sizes.",
test each food type systematically to see how they affect you.,
this will reduce the amount of glucose you eat.,

white bread has more or less the same glycaemic curve as sugar so toast is off limits i'm afraid.,
"becoming more active will improve your sensitivity to the insulin that you do produce which, in turn, will reduce your blood glucose levels.",
"losing weight will also help your insulin function, even if weight is not the ultimate cause of your metabolic disorder.",
it usually works with a combination of exercise to again improve your sensitivity to the insulin that you obviously are producing.,
the combination of all these factors should be enough to get you down from 7.7 to 6.0.,

"i told her i was managing average fasting which seemed to think was ok she did mention my cholesterol was 7.4(i think )and saudi would have to go on statins for that and gave me a prescription and said its quite normal for diabetics with high cholesterol , she also mentioned i was pre diabetic ages ago .",
my blood pressure was 120/80.,
are the statins essential ?,
incidentally i was convinced i had lost at least 3/4 stone at least as my trousers are falling of me but she said i had only lost a kilo from three weeks ago when i was first diagnosed .,
one other point is what does metformin actually do?,
i also received a call from the diabetic nurse this morning and she said i can come of the gliclaside which was good news.,
"noblehead said: no one can make you take statins and that is for you to decide if you want to take them or not, i'm not sure i entirely agree with what your dr said that its quite normal for diabetics to have high cholesterol as i've had diabetes for the last 33 years and my cholesterol is fine (and i don't take any meds for it).",
click to expand...,
"i am leaning towards more long walks rather than the statins , the cholesterol results are from three weeks ago when the proverbial hit the fan, it looks like the cholesterol is the next battle?",
daibell said: hi.,
as far as i'm aware diabetics have the same range of cholesterol level as others.,
arguments about the value of statins rage out there and it appears to be true that the pharma companies manipulated the data in the 60s/70s and convinced the establishment that we all needed these (profitable) drugs.,
the body needs cholesterol for reairs etc and the important thing is not the total which is largely irrelevant but the hdl/ldl ratio.,
ask the gp for these numbers and with a low-carb diet the ratio should come good.,
"metformin has three actions, the main one being to help reduce insulin resistance in muscle cells.",
"it also reduces the liver's output of glucose and, i think, enables the bowel to slightly reduce it's absorption of glucose.",
all of these actions have a much smaller effect than the low-carb diet.,
click to expand...,
"thanks for your comments daibell, hope to get of the metformin next.",
"i still can't get over only a one kilo weight loss , i'll get in touch with the nurse tomorrow and get the hdl/ldl , i feel the low carb will sort all, and i have a gut feeling my cholesterol like my blood sugar has improved from three weeks ago , which are the results she was referring to.",

"hi winnie can't tell you how much i appreciated your comments , info ( books ordered) and thoughts.",
"i was just getting my head round the diabetes and cholestral issue turns up, on top of that i'm handed a prescription for statins .",
and you say that weight loss for diabetes doesn't alway assist good cholestral levels.,
i'm going to have a word with the diabetic nurse at the clinic and get my exact hdl/ldl readings and post them later as i just want to get to a place of understanding and exceptence .,
"i'm still very confused about eating fats , yogurts , milk , cheese , i'm not sure if i can eat lamb or bacon for example now.",
strange days.,
"winnie53 said: rog, i saw the other thread you started today, so had a look at your other posts to understand better where you are in this process.",
we're similar in age and both new to low carb.,
i started the lchf diet in mid-february.,
"and i also was pressured to start a statin, so made a serious effort to learn what i could about diabetes, cholesterol, and statins.",
"this is a long post, but my hope is that at least some of it will be helpful to you.",
"when i read this study published in 2012, ""progression of vascular calcification is increased with statin use in the veterans affairs diabetes trial (vadt)"", i was able to make my decision.",
i think you'll find this overview of the study of interest... abstract objective to determine the effect of statin use on progression of vascular calcification in type 2 diabetes (t2dm).,
research design and methods progression of coronary artery calcification (cac) and abdominal aortic artery calcification (aac) was assessed according to the frequency of statin use in 197 participants with t2dm.,
"results after adjustment for baseline cac and other confounders, progression of cac was significantly higher in more frequent statin users than in less frequent users (mean se, 8.2 0.5 mm3 vs. 4.2 1.1 mm3; p < 0.01).",
"aac progression was in general not significantly increased with more frequent statin use; in a subgroup of participants initially not receiving statins, however, progression of both cac and aac was significantly increased in frequent statin users.",
conclusions more frequent statin use is associated with accelerated cac in t2dm patients with advanced atherosclerosis.,
the role of statins in prevention of cardiovascular disease (cvd) in type 2 diabetes (t2dm) is well established.,
"despite the wide use of statins, however, calcific atherosclerosis is accelerated in t2dm and is associated with increased risk of cvd morbidity and mortality in this population ( 1 ).",
the purpose of the current study was to determine the effect of statin use on progression of vascular calcification in t2dm participants with advanced atherosclerosis.,
"here's the link so you can print and read the entire study... http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/35/11/2390.full i also went onto the amazon website in the uk to find a book that explains how atherosclerosis is caused by inflammation, not cholesterol, and that is also supportive of the lchf diet.",
"this one from 2012 was written by an american cardiologist, and has been a great help to me.",
"of the six books on heart disease i've surveyed over the last couple of months, this one has been the most helpful... http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/..._rd_t=36701&pf_rd_p=577048427&pf_rd_i=desktop the great cholesterol myth: why lowering your cholesterol won't prevent heart disease: and the statin free plan that will is a very good book that is written in easily understood language that includes references.",
"it explains the role of diabetes in heart disease, also how inflammation, not saturated and monounsaturated fats or cholesterol causes heart disease.",
"it also explains what the different lab tests are and provides specific recommendations on diet, nutritional supplements, and medications.",
"i encourage you to read it one chapter at a time, pencil in hand, so you can underline key points and write notes in the margin.",
"and here's a book written by a uk author that has chapters that i think will help you interpret the results of your lipid panel - (perhaps you could check it out from the library)... http://www.amazon.co.uk/cut-your-ch...tmm_hrd_title_0?ie=utf8&qid=1433996846&sr=1-4 i think, if you read these two books, you'll be able to make a more informed decision regarding your diet and whether or not to take a statin.",
my experience with the lchf diet thus far has been positive.,
i was able to reduce my blood glucose levels within a month.,
"my a1c was 9.9% in february, 5.5% in may.",
"my cholesterol, triglycerides, hdl, and ldl remained unchanged between february and may, but my hdl moved into the normal range, so there was a slight improvement.",
"my hscrp-cardio result was bad - (i'm at ""high risk"" for heart disease, meaning i likely have atherosclerosis of the arteries).",
"so i'm continuing on the lchf diet, testing my blood glucose 4 to 8 times a day, and taking a few thoughtfully chosen, high quality nutritional supplements: a multi-vitamin & mineral supplement (that includes all the b vitamins and 2,000 iu vitamin d3), vitamin c, magnesium citrate, potassium citrate, coq10, cod liver oil (for the vitamin a), vitamin k2 (mk-7), fish oil, meriva, and an ""eye protection"" formulation.",
i'm taking many of these supplements specifically to improve my heart and artery health.,
"after reading, thinking about, and practicing the lchf diet for four months, these are the conclusions i've come to...",
"i need to have carbs, fat, and protein at every meal.",
"carbs (and protein) are where i'm getting the most nutrition: vitamins, minerals, other nutrients, and in the case of the carbs, fiber too.",
"fiber helps with digestion, and also with maintaining a healthy gut flora.",
"studies show that ""higher consumption of fruit and veg is associated with a reduced risk of mortality from just about every cause, including heart disease and stroke.""...",
"http://drsarahbrewer.com/2015/04/15/why-5-a-day-and-not-more/ fats provide the calories i need (now that i've eliminated sugar, grains, starchy vegetables, and legumes from my diet; eliminating these carbs will bring both my blood glucose and my triglyceride levels down).",
"they also provide needed fatty acids, take away feelings of hunger, and improve the particle size of my ldl and hdl cholesterol.",
"protein is where i get more vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients.",
and it helps me maintain my muscle mass.,
"carbs are non-starchy vegetables including green, leafy salads with a vinaigrette dressing - (2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar).",
"fats are primarily saturated and monounsaturated fats - (butter, extra virgin olive oil, unrefined coconut oil, and avocado).",
"protein is primarily meat, poultry, fish, eggs, a variety of raw nuts, and hard cheeses.",
there needs to be a balance of these macronutrients.,
"i believe it's important to eat whole, plant based foods throughout the day with the fat and protein.",
"i say all this because i worry that those new to the lchf diet become overly focused on the fat and protein, and as a result may not be getting a enough vegetables (and berries) in a variety of colors each week.",
"@rog from what i've read, your blood glucose levels are excellent and you're losing weight.",
that's great!,
"i know the cholesterol is a bit of a worry right now, but i think after you get a print out of your lab results and you read these two books, you'll have a better understanding and appreciation of the progress you're making.",
it might also help to get your cholesterol checked every 3 - 6 months for now so you can make adjustments to your diet if your cholesterol begins trending up rather than down.,
"but that's a bit of a tricky business because cholesterol levels go up while you're actively losing weight on the lchf diet, so it's better to have your cholesterol checked when you're maintaining your weight, not losing.",
"in fact, your recent lipid panel may have been influenced by your recent weight loss.",
click to expand... hello again winnie.,
got the audio of the great cholesterol myth: amazing so far and contradictory to the thinking we are led to believe.,
"i spoke to the diabetic nurse at the clinic today and told her my dilemma about the statins , she gave me the clinics position and said diabetics of middle age are high risk but she said however if i want to give the diet option a try so be it.",
"what part of the book does the author talk about diabetic related to cholestral as i havnt got their yet , the author did say that the only people he would advise to take statins are middle aged men who have had heart attacks or actual cardivasculour problems so far.",
the no camp for statins are winning at this point.,
"winnie53 said: @rog it's chapter 4, sugar: the real demon in the diet.",
i listen to audio recordings of books too.,
"if after listening to the book, you like it, i encourage you to get a copy of the book so you can use the table of contents and index to re-review specific topics, which i find myself doing a lot!",

"i'm sure i've read about this being a symptom of diabetes, having a metallic taste in your mouth but have never experienced it until yesterday.",
we've been in holland for a few days and i found it tough to low carb there-very few veggies and bread and chips with everything.,
since yesterday i've had a nasty taste in my mouth and i wondered if this is due to my carbs ( and blood sugar ) going a bit higher than usual.,
"if anyone else has suffered this, will it go away when i'm back to my low carb diet, or is there another way of getting rid of it.",
i don't like it!,
hello everyone and if someone can answer me they are grateful.,
"my problem is i do not know if i have diabetes or not, but from a month or so ago, my urine has sweet smelling bubbles that disappear after a few minutes almost all.",
"if i had enough water almost there, and if i have not taken enough water have enough bubbles with sweet smell ...",
i get up at least 1 time at night to urinate enough bubbles (after 4 or 5 hours of sleeping) .,
i have no thirst exes.,
i have no hunger exes.,
my wounds heal normally.,
i do not feel tired.,
i ask because i have sweet smelling bubbles ???,
i do not eat sweet.,

"a third medication called 'dulicity', has just recently been approved for use in the us and, as opposed to the other two, it apparently comes pre - mixed in a ready - to - use injection pen like victoza or the standard insulin pens.",
and i'm sure there'll be more on the way after that.,

hi..,
i have been dreading the eye screening which i have monday..i suffer with anxiety about certain things and this is really freaking me out about having my eyes dilated.,
it's not the fact of the test it's just the drops being put in and what it will do to my sight..,
i'm probably being so silly about all this but i'm working myself up and even thought of not going which i know i must go...i have been told my eyes will be blurry for few hours and that's what making me panic ..,
i know i'll just freak out if i can't see much .wish i didn't have this anxiety and i was calmer.. anyone that could give me more info about this i'd appreciate it.,
many thanks thankyou for all your messages .they are all comforting to know it's not that bad..,
i'm just being silly.,
i honestly do have a fear of my eyes being blurred ..,
i'm sure i'll be fine and hope they won't stay blurred for long .. thankyou everyone xx thankyou all so much feel much easier about it i think eeeeek avocado sevenfold said: i have not had the drops.,
three years of hospital eye clinic tests and yearly optician tests and no drops.,
the leaflet that comes with the appointment letter says that not everybody needs them.,
i always plan for it though by taking sunglasses.,
good luck @maxjoe121 things are always worse in our imagination.,
you will be fine x click to expand... hi...,
i'm sure i will be thankyou... positive thinking,
hi i was wondering in anyone has taken jardiance or forxiga for type 2 diabetes.,
my partner was prescribed jardiance 10mg once a day but it because it send sugars straight to your kidneys he is needing to visit the bathroom an awful lot more.,
his consultant then changed him to forxiga but that does the same thing and has the same effects so we are both having lots of interrupted sleep at the moment.,
i was just wondering if anyone has tried these and how they got on with them?,
does the constant thirst and need to urinate get any better?,
he basically has the same symptoms now as he did when he was first diagnosed with diabetes almost 2 years ago.,
his blood sugars are up and down between 6.5 and 8.9 most days.,
last night they went up to 18.2 because he didn't take the tablet for 2 days.,
so he definately needs to be taking medication.,
due to other medical issues he can't take metformin or methotrexate.,
any comments/suggestions would be most welcome.,
many thanks in advance.,
mags,
"ok so short info: 17 y/o diagnosed 10 1/2 years ago type 1 i went to the foot people (forgotten the proper term sorry) when i was first diagnosed, but then they never contacted me since.",
recently i got a letter from the foot place saying i'm due an appointment.,
and they haven't had any available appointments since contacting me.,
but this past few weeks i've noticed the skin on my toes has started to come off.,
"and just after getting out of the shower, as i went to dry my feet i saw how bad they'd gone since a few days ago.",
any ideas what's happening and if it's anything to worry about?,
i'm quite worried now.,
no itching at all.,
but have recently not known when my feet are warm or cold unless touching them @deespee23 so some type of cream/ powder?,
so short term- foot powder/ cream.,
long term (when i can get an appointment) see the doctors rather than the foot person or can the foot people issue prescriptions?,
ok i'll give that number a ring but book in to the doctors at the same time just in case for prescription etc,
"hi all, first post on the forum, i am hitting the half a year mark of being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, i have changed my diet and excersize patterns to ensure that i maintain my fitness and health for as long as possible, i have researched into many different aspects of treatment studied the mechanisms of the disease to try and understand it better, something which has came to my attention was the massive potential for cbd or cannabidol as a medicine to go alongside my 4 daily injections, this however has proven to be a nightmare because cbd is found within the cannabis plant (which is scheduled as a class b substance within the uk meaning to access this you are regarded as a criminal) however it produces no ""high"" effects and the more research i find the more i can say that it looks like it may possibly be one of the most medicinal compounds for treating forms of autoimmune disorders, understand that type 1 diabetes is a failure in the immune system which causes the type 1 response which destroys cells within the iselts of the pancreas which are responsible for the production of insulin, a multinational pharma called gw is based within the uk and has had several papers specific to diabetes which can be found here ( http://www.gwpharm.com/publications-1.aspx ) has indicated the theraputic benefits of cbd which modulate the immune system in a very positive light.",
"i am not however an expert on the specifics of any of this however i have noticed a massive benefit from cbd rich strains of cannabis (alongside healthy diet and excersize) in keeping my blood sugars in check for up to 3 days after consuming edibles, my needs for insulin also decrease when i can get my hands on edible forms.",
i would like to know if anyone else has looked into this or is even aware of this?,
many thanks pete!,
"http://www.projectcbd.org/conditions/diabetes-2/ here is another list of medical journals which relate to both type 1 and type 2 the reason why this is hard to get ahold of in terms of the illicit substances markets is due to the breeding programs which non medicinal users have aimed to increase the thc balance of the plant without paying any regards to the cbd content, most ""standard"" cannabis on the streets these are varieties of skunk which have increased thc production from around 8-15% in normal landrace plants (which hold a 1:1 ratio of cbd:thc) to a percentage of upwards of 25% thc content with the cbd percentages dwindling to below 1%, this is the reason why i can safely say that buying cannabis of the street to tackle illness is a complete waste of time.",
however if a state of prohibition was to be lifted we could import cannabis from a regulated supplier like bedrocan (dutch cannabis producing phrama) who offer specific strains of cannabis with thc and cbd content clearly labeled and regulated.,
"bediol ( http://www.bedrocan.nl/english/products/bediol.html ) which contains appr 6.3% thc and appr 8% cbd, would be available to uk users if the ban on importation was lifted.",
i have discussed my cannabis use with my diabetic doctor when attending clinics and the response i have received thus far is it cannot be controlled or regulated which is complete and utter nonsense.,
"i personally feel that the issues regarding cannabis have always been directed at campaigns of scaremongering which has allowed pharmaceticals to maintain a massive cash cow from diabetic patients which generally increase overtime due to more and more insulin being needed, if this could help your body to stop attacking its own b cells would you not like to help your body help itself or would rather continue to replace what it fails to produce.",
"a simple analogy to make this clearer is to look at your pancreas like a bathtub and your insulin as the water which fills that bathtub, if a bathtub has a hole in it would you continue to keep filling it with water as the hole grow's larger and larger or would you look to try and fix the hole.",
im not saying that cbd will cure diabetes but i have an overwhelming amount of scientific research to suggest that it may modulate your immune system in a way which slows down the attack of the b cells in your body allowing it a chance to repair itself somewhat and reduce the dependance on pharmaceutical medications which make your body feel like a machine rather than living breathing organism.,
"rharding93 said: hi pete, i know this is an old thread but i wondered what your experience was using cbd?",
i've been type 1 for 12 years and am about to start using cbd oil.,
have had quite a lot of hypo anxiety in the past and while i'm hopeful that cbd will lower my insulin requirements i'm also a bit apprehensive of any sudden change in my doses.,
"thanks, rachel click to expand... hi rachel, i had some mixed results with cannabis including cbd, i found that overall cbd didn't have much effect on blood sugars (i did feel slightly better when taking it) what was interesting was that i had found was that certain strains of cannabis would have a massively positive effect on my blood sugars but i can safely say that it was nor the thc or cbd but there must be some other cannabinoid which has this resulting effect.",
i however could not say any more as the constant use of cannabis had negative effects on my mental health (not mention my blood sugars due to munchies) which has left me unable to use it for any medicinal purpose.,
"hi everyone, i have just joined the forum and wonder if anyone had a list of fruits that are good or bad for type 2 diabetes.",

any help would be appreciated oldtimer :thumbup: thanks everyone for you suggestions and ideas.,

"hello, i'm new to the forum.",
i was diagnosed with type 2 several months ago.,
my question is about water consumption.,
"when i first started taking metformin, my excessive water consumption went down to normal and i could sleep through the night without having to go to the bathroom.",
i was taking 1000mg at that time and this continued for 2 weeks.,
"however after the 2 weeks, i started drinking more water again and now drink as much as i used to before my diagnosis.",
"i haven't really counted, but estimate that i drink at least 12 8oz glasses of water a day.",
"by the way, i now take 750mg of metformin daily.",
1000mg seemed to be too much as it gave me nausea and i couldn't eat.,
my glucose levels with 750mg is just fine and my doctor suggested continuing this way.,
why do you think i still drink so much water?,
i'm worried that i will damage my kidneys if i keep this up for the rest of my life.,
has anyone else experienced the same?,
thank you.,
thanks for your replies and sorry for not responding earlier!,
i was expecting an email when i get replies.,
"my last hba1c is 5,1.",
and i do self test at home.,
my hunger glucose levels are around 80-90mg/dl and after meal levels are around 98-110mg/dl.,
"and now that i think about it, my close and extended family drinks a lot of water too.",
my mom and dad both drink a lot.,
so maybe it's genetic?,
and we drink a lot of tea over here.,
"since tea and coffee are diuretic, that might be another reason for why i get more thirsty and salt.",
thanks again for the replies!,
@catherine-- that's so sweet that you checked the weather here!,
yes the mediterranean is warmer and more humid.,
i'm going up north in a few days where its a lot cooler so maybe water consumption will go down.,
"many men prefer not to speak on the subject for the sensitivity of the problem but today we will try to discuss it because it is an important topic and may include many diabetics i have heard a lot about the failure of some marital relationships because of diabetes because of the health, psychological, economic and sexual problems what concerns us here are sexual problems i have heard that many marriage relationships have stopped because of that the question is whether the person with diabetes should have this problem ?",

i would say that there are many ways to give and to receive sexual pleasure that ed has absolutely no impact on and are therefore not affected by diabetes.,
in answer to your questions about whether it is the problem just for the person with diabetes and what is the solution i think that the issue is one for both members of a couple and that one approach to a solution is to be inventive / open minded.,

"here's the second paragraph of what the naturopathic physicians wrote about alpha-lipoic acid (ala)... ""alpha-lipoic acid is an approved drug in germany for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy and has been successfully used there for more than 30 years.",
the beneficial effects of alpha-lipoic acid in diabetic neuropathy have been confirmed in several double-blind studies at a dosage of 400 to 600 mg per day.,
"(174,175) although the primary effect of alpha-lipoic acid in improving diabetic neuropathy is thought to be the result of its antioxidant effects, it has also been shown to lead to an improvement in blood glucose metabolism, improve blood flow to peripheral nerves, and actually stimulate the regeneration of nerve fibers.",

(pp 539) i hope you'll come back to let us know if it's helpful.,
click to expand...,
yes i will let you know how it goes.,
i didn't know about the diabetic side of it so that has to be good.,
"i wonder if anyone else on here have tried it, would be interesting to find out.",
"winnie53 said: lilliepop, i did some more looking around this morning.",
"you can too by doing a search on ""burning mouth syndrome diabetes"".",
it appears that there are multiple causes of bms.,
diabetes appears to be one cause.,
this article provides a good overview with links to encouraging studies done 10 or more years ago - (also other possible causes that you can investigate)... is there a bms-diabetes connection?,
"a collaboration of researchers from universities in naples and london decided to investigate the possibility that lipoic acid (technically, alpha-lipoic acid, and also known as thioctic acid) might be good for treating bms, because of an intriguing link that may exist between bms and diabetes, for which lipoic acid is known to be helpful.",
"it had been noted long ago that many patients with bms have high blood glucose levels, although no consistent or causal relationship has been documented.5 more recent studies of various kinds have led to the suspicion that bms, despite its maddeningly ambiguous and seemingly numerous origins, is a kind of peripheral neuropathy, a common symptom of long-term, poorly controlled diabetes (it can also occur independently of diabetes).",
"in medicine, peripheral means far from the center of the body, which usually means the extremities, but in this case it means the mouth (far enough).",
"neuropathy means nerve damage, and there are different causes, including high glucose levels, although how glucose damages nerves is not clear.",
neuropathy generally manifests either as severe pain or as a loss of feeling - an all-or-nothing deal.,
"lipoic acid works well on bms so what we have is an apparent peripheral neuropathy with a possible connection to diabetes - and it's known that lipoic acid is effective in treating neuronal (nerve-cell) damage, especially in diabetic neuropathy.6-8 you connect the dots.",
"the italian-british research team certainly did, and the initial result was a randomized, placebo-controlled - but open (not blinded) - clinical trial of the efficacy of lipoic acid on the one symptom of burning mouth syndrome: pain.9 the study involved 42 patients (two age- and sex-matched groups of 21 each), all with classic cases of bms and no other conditions that might confound the results.",
"the results were highly positive: 76% of the test subjects taking lipoic acid (600 mg/day for 20 days, followed by 200 mg/day for 10 days) showed some improvement, with 43% showing ""decided"" improvement.",
"by contrast, only 14% of the control subjects taking placebo showed some improvement (0% had decided improvement).",
"when the controls were then switched over to lipoic acid for 30 days, their improvement rate increased to 67% (52% had decided improvement).",
"no side effects were reported, which is consistent with lipoic acid's excellent reputation for safety.",
"lipoic acid works really well on bms encouraged by these results - which bolstered their belief that bms may be a form of peripheral neuropathy - the same research team undertook a more rigorous study (randomized, placebo-controlled, and double-blind) with the same objective.10 this time, 60 patients were involved (two groups of 30 each).",
"this time the results were even better: 97% of the subjects on lipoic acid (600 mg/day for 2 months) showed some improvement (73% had decided improvement), whereas 40% of the controls showed some improvement (0% had decided improvement).",
"in the lipoic acid group, four patients (13%) showed ""resolution,"" i.e., a complete cessation of pain, which amounts to a cure; this did not occur in any of the controls.",
"none of the patients on lipoic acid got worse during the course of the study, whereas six (20%) of the controls did.",
"again, there were no side effects.",
"read the entire article here... http://www.life-enhancement.com/mag...lps-quench-the-fire-of-burning-mouth-syndrome lilliepop, neuropathy, unfortunately, is an all too common complication of diabetes.",
i believe more than 100 types have been described.,
"so the alpha-lipoic acid (ala) is a good place to start along with keeping your blood glucose levels within or as close as possible to the normal range, which you are already doing, which is good.",
"hopefully, someone else will see your post and share what worked for them.",
"if not, you'll know in time whether or not the ala is working for you.",
"the good news is that it's good for you, whether it works for your bms or not.",
fingers and toes crossed it reduces or eliminates your bms symptoms.,

"i want to post it at work and include it in the diabetes information packet i'm putting together for new members of our local education, support, and walking diabetes group.",
many thanks!,
"yes jaylee, that's the graphic.",
i've saved the graphic in two different formats.,
thank you.,
"i'm hoping for a link to the graphic on this website too, perhaps with an explanation of what hba1c (ifcc), hba1c (dcct), mg/dl, and mmol/l means.",
does it exist?,
"for example, i'm assuming that hba1c (dcct) is what we use in the us, and that hba1c (ifcc) is what you all use in the uk.",
thanks again!,
[edited to add]: i'd also like an explanation as to how the mg/dl and mmol/l relates to the hba1c.,
"i'm assuming it is the calculated average glucose level, but not sure.",
i suppose it alternately be the calculated fasting glucose level.,
@freema thanks for posting this graphic on another topic today.,
it was the first time i'd seen it.,
@scott-c thanks for the second graphic.,
the two together provide a more complete overview.,
"in the first graphic, those of you in the uk and elsewhere use the first number (hba1c - ifcc) and fourth number (blood glucose in mmol/l).",
those of us in the usa use the second number (hba1c - dcct) and third number (blood glucose in mg/dl).,
americans can easily convert the numbers in the second graphic using the first graphic (or use the converters in the two links below).,
"for americans, some of the conversion work is already done in the second graphic: an hba1c (ifcc) of 31 mmol/mol (represented in blue for the uk and elsewhere) is already converted to an hba1c (dcct) of 5% (represented in white for the usa).",
"in addition, there's a ""hba1c units converter - dcct to ifcc"" here... http://www.diabetes.co.uk/hba1c-units-converter.html however, americans will still have to convert the blood glucose level at the bottom of the second graphic of 5.4 (mmol/l) to 97 (mg/dl) using first graphic.",
"or use this ""blood sugar converter"" here... http://www.diabetes.co.uk/blood-sugar-converter.html here's the blood glucose levels converted from uk and elsewhere (mmol/l) to usa (mg/dl) 5.4 mmol/l is 97.2 mg/dl 7.0 mmol/l is 126 mg/dl 8.6 mmol/l is 154.8 mg/dl 10.2 mmol/l is 183.6 mg/dl 11.8 mmol/l is 212.4 mg/dl 13.4 mmol/l is 241.2 mg/dl 14.9 mmol/l is 269 mg/dl 16.9 mmol/l is 297 mg/dl hope this helps americans trying to understand these two graphics.",
"hi everyone, my doctor gives my hba1c as a whole number, it was 62 now its 60 and he says i should be getting it to 53.",

thoughts?,
so this weekend i received a letter from my doctors asking me to go for my flu jab.,

my question is why are we put into this category?,

"350g carbs per day should by my opinion trigger higher insulin, but i have been taking last weeks also high doses of alpha lipoic acid + acetyl l carnitine which are both known to improve insulin resistance and lower insulin.",
in my case it seems they lowered insulin too much.,
from the day i started alpha lipoic acid and carnitine my situation started to get even worse than before: -tired and sleepy -impossible to gain any weight -bad blood circulation -very difficult to do any weight lifting training i have been felling very tired for last 4 years and my doctor thinks it is just depression which i don't believe.,
i checked thyroid and testosterone levels and they are fine.,
do anybody have any idea or thoughts if my symptoms could be related to low insulin levels even if my glucose is always normal?,
"it is done in laboratory, i ordered it together with some other tests.",
"my last hbca1 was 80, up from 50 last year.",
i've started on metformin and lchf to remedy this.,
"i had been getting little infections in the skin creases around the top of my legs , under my belly and under my breasts, along with a cyst that healed and then came back again despite keeping myself clean and dry.",
i know thrush can be as a result of poor control but are these small infections too?,
"tia jo grantgam1337 said: in short, yes.",
high bg provides an ideal breeding ground for the bacteria which we can naturally carry on our skin.,
high bg can also compromise your immune system; so it doesn't fight infection as well as it should.,
the end result is the cysts and boils that you're unfortunately experiencing.,
getting your hba1c back down to 50 (but preferably lower if you can) will be the best place to start.,
"you can be as clean and dry as you like, but if your sugars are poorly managed then you're unlikely to notice any improvements with your skin i'm afraid.",
"i don't mean to instill any panic or fear into you, but an hba1c of 80 will cause a lot more damage than just a few boils... do you test your bg?",
click to expand...,
yes i test.,
i've been on 1 x500mg metformin for 2 weeks (double from tomorrow) and lchf for about the same time.,
my bg is reducing but is obviously not low enough yet.,
lowest they've been in the past 2 weeks is 7 before food and 9.2 two hours after.,
"an hour after that, down to between 8 and 8.6.",
"highest readings are after waking, average 10.4.",
"they were around 14. noblehead said: i'm afraid so, have a read of the following which explains all: http://www.diabetesselfmanagement.c...-diabetes-information/diabetes-and-your-skin/ click to expand...",
thank you.,
"fortunately, other than these little infections from time to time, i don't have any other issues.",
the cyst/ boil healed a good while ago and hasn't returned.,
"i use hypoallergenic soap etc because i have always had sensitive skin and i don't use creams, potions, lotions or perfume for the same reason.",
"hopefully once my bg is controlled better, ill not see a reappearance freema said: how many grams are your daily amount of carbs ?",
"click to expand... last week, 100g or less.",
this past week between 20 and 50g grantgam1337 said: well it looks like you're making all the right decisions to improve your bg.,
"it will obviously take a bit of time to improve, but you're testing your bg and following a good diet wrt to successful bg management - so you're making all the right choices.",
"i don't know if you exercise, but if you were to add that to the mix, then you'd really find it hard to not improve those numbers good luck to you @joandollie , the benefits are endless!",

many thanks for your input.,
i was diagnosed 8 years ago but have only recently had problems.,
i do a small amount of walking every day but no other exercise due to back problems and osteoarthritis.,
"i work in an office doing a 9 to 5 now, whereas my previous life was running a pub, on my feet 12 -16 hours a day, eating on the run.",
"freema said: oh that is low, well a fine job you are doing, maybe also count your grams of protein, not more than 0,8 grams pro kg body-weight , as excess proteins can be changed by the liver into glucose ... except from that there is only excercise and fasting left.... if you could take like 3 days of fasting like only two smal meals of 250 calories each in a eating window of 6 hours those 3 days it would probably also help yoy getting it down.",
click to expand...,
i will certainly bear this in mind.,
i'm increasing metformin every 2 weeks until i reach 4 x 500mg a day.,
"once there, i think i will have a better idea of what i need to do next.",
freema said: yes but metformin doesnt do much unfortunately maybe only 10% at the highest.. click to expand...,
i did read this on the forum.,
i've only been low carb for 2 weeks.,
hopefully i will continue to see results in both reducing bg and losing weight.,
increasing the metformin just gives me a time scale to work to and then i will reassess freema said: loosing weight also helps a lot also in my case with my arthritis especially in my feet and legs my pain is almost gone now from low carbing especially but also from loosing a lot of weight.... and it is also much easier on very low carb to lose weight combined with calory counting.. click to expand...,
"i had been on slimming world prior to my last test and lost over a stone, but being carb heavy and eating 3 meals a day made me feel like ****.",
"stupidly, poor control of diabetes didn't occur to me at first.",
"after 8 years of no issues, i dismissed it.",
not so easy to dismiss after a result of 80.,
"on lchf i'm losing a couple of lb a week which i'm happy with grantgam1337 said: that's no problem at all, that's why we're all on the forum - to help each other out if we can sorry to hear about your arthritis, as if having one chronic condition wasn't enough... have you tried any non impact exercise, something like swimming or cycling?",
"i don't know how bad the arthritis is, so even those may be out of the question.",
click to expand...,
"the arthritis is only in my neck - thankfully, but it causes me pain etc in my right shoulder/arm/hand.",
add to that sciatica on the same side and it means only my left side is capable of anything strenuous for any length of time.,
don't get me wrong - i'm very mobile - but right now even vaccing is painful during and after.,
"i'm hoping weight loss and lowered bg will lead to being able to start swimming freema said: and meanwhile when getting your blood glucose down counting daily carbs, you can maybe also try after consulting your gp try using a thin layer of some cream with zink in it, as fungus and some bakterias can not thrive in zink.. https://www.drugs.com/cdi/zinc-oxide-cream.html click to expand...",

apologies for duplication from another thread but wanted to ask advice about 10 second rule on injecting.... ....background info from other thread.... molly56 said: just wondered how common it is to experience pain on injecting or bleeding from injection site....my partner seems to often experience these when injecting his insulin (novomix 30 flexpen / mylife penfine classic 4mm needles).....injecting into stomach area.......is this usual or is there a way of minimising this... click to expand... molly56 said: have just been reading around on forum and am wondering if my partner's injection technique is part of the problem.....he always injects in the stomach area and doesn't pinch the skin when injecting....i have also noticed that he only holds it in place for two or at the most three seconds before withdrawing the needle and saying 'that's done'... am i correct in assuming that holding the needle in place for the ten seconds as recommended would allow for the insulin to be absorbed into the fatty layer before withdrawing leading to better overall absorption......and that pain and bleeding would be less likely to occur as insulin would not be leaked out.,
is difficult for me to criticise his injection technique as he is reluctant to listen to what i have to say and thinks he is doing it correctly....however if i can say that holding it in place longer will help to minimise any pain or bleeding perhaps i can get him to try it this way for a while and see if it improves.,
as far as injection sites go he has only ever used his stomach as is the easiest part to get to....and don't think (know) he has any particular system in place as to where in his stomach he will inject....would guess that most injections are roughly in the same place depending on which hand he holds his insulin pen in.....i have vaguely mentioned moving the injection site around but he wouldn't remember where he had done it last time anyway... click to expand... how is the best way of explaining the 10 second rule when injecting insulin....what are the reasons behind this...is it to do with absorption or minimising leakage.....why 10 seconds...what happens if you do less than 10 seconds.... am just wondering how i can best explain this to my partner to improve his injection technique and perhaps minimise the pain and bleeding he currently experiences......and if those problems exist because of poor injection technique.. @shar67 did suggest (on other thread) getting the dn to explain this to him but unfortunately i am unable to go to his next appointment with him to ask the question and regardless of this being explained on a couple of occasions in the past he soon reverts back to the 'quick in and out' method.,
..as i see him inject on a daily basis i was wondering if there are any useful suggestions i could make (preferably on a casual basis) that will encourage him to follow the 10 second rule.,
ambersilva said: i was told to count to 10 so that the device has time to deliver the dose.,
"with the short 4 or 5 mm needles there is no need to ""pinch the skin"".",
the reason for needing to pinch or to clutch the fat layer before injecting was recommended when using longer needles so as to not inject into muscle.,
sometimes we hit a nerve and feel pain.,
other times it just stings.,
sometimes we hit a minute capillary and we bleed and bruise.,
a new needle for each injection is recommended because the sharp tip becomes blunted after continued use.,
it must be very irritating for your partner to have you watching his technique.,
you are only seeing the visible part of his diabetic management regimen.,
you have no way of knowing how he actually feels from minute to minute.,
there is so much more to diabetes than just the injections.,
my recommendation to you is to leave him to deal with his injections his way as he does 24/7.,
click to expand... @ambersilva ...just to clarify the point about 'watching'......perhaps i should have used the term 'noticing'.....he takes his insulin as i am dishing up the dinner and i notice his technique....but make no comment.,
i do leave him to get on with it but just wonder if he improved his technique it would help him to feel less despondent about the pain...and the correct amount of insulin would be delivered.,
"dannyw said: to be fair to op, i've been told how to inject properly but i'm not 100% sure of why we count to 10 secs or what happens if we don't so the points are very valid and may/may not improve her partners diabetes management.",
click to expand... @dannyw ....that i think was my point....no one to my knowledge has explained 'why'....if he knew why and that it would improve his injection experience in terms of minimising pain or bleeding then he would feel more comfortable about the process.,
jaylee said: hi @molly56 i am assuming your partner uses a modern pen?,
"the mechanism in these devices have a ""smoother action"" regarding insulin delivery these days.",
"but, if one was to do an ""airshot"" of (for instance) 10 units?",
(an airshot of 2 is always done prior to injection to prime the needle & expell any trapped air.),
"the stream of insulin will fire into the air, and as the insulin jet drops off when the plunger in the barrel pushing the bung comes to rest.",
you should then see a couple of droplets emerge from the end of the needle..?,
there may be a split second delay in this action.,
"so the ten second rule is to allow ""absorption"" as mentioned by my good fellow injectors earlier.",
"thus ensuring the correct dose.... click to expand... @jaylee ...thanks for comments....this raises another issue about injection technique....my partner never (and i mean, never) does the 2 unit airshot before dialling up dose and injecting....just wondered how much this matters ....could air in the needle potentially cause pain or discomfort when injecting or affect absorption of insulin... jaylee said: hi @administrator , can i be a little bit forward in asking if this thread can be merged with the topic in the link attached by the same op, covering pretty much the same issue..",
i feel this action would help the op acumilate the advice given a little more efficiently..,

hi everyone.,
ive been a type 1 for nearly 3 years now.,
"ive always eaten a high protein diet as i started weight training around 6 years ago at the age of 18 and up until recently this has caused me no issues whatsoever, even after becoming diabetic.",
over the last few months my bg levels were starting to rise slightly higher than usual after eating.,
normally 2 hours post meal my level would be in-between 5 & 7 but i was finding readings to be now closer to 10-12 (obviously not what i want!).,
"i narrowed it down to it being caused by the high volume of protein i was eating with each meal and i am now finding myself having to inject insulin for something as simple as 1 roasted chicken breast, something i never had to do for the first 2.5 years of being diabetic.",
after doing some digging online i've found that its due to glucagon being released to match the insulin release (that obviously i am not getting from my body anymore) that shuttles the amino acids from the protein into my muscles.,
do many other people experience this?,
i was never told that this would happen from any of the diabetic dieticians/nurses or from when i went on the dafne course so i was just looking for a bit more info.,
slightly annoying as i'm now finding myself not only having to calculate the amount of carbs i'm eating but also if i need to inject extra to cover the protein.,
i have also found that varying protein sources give different results.,
i.e beef does not seem to effect me as much as chicken does.,
any info would be great.,
thank you,
can anyone help with an answer for me?,
"i have recently had my big toe amputated, and while in hospital my leg was quite swollen, but it went down and has been fine for weeks.",

"i have rested with my feet up, to no avail, and they are quite painful, in a throbbing, tight sort of way.",
"(if that makes sense) i am finding it difficult to move around, as i am so uncomfortable.",
"is this just the heat, although it has never affected me before, or could it be something more sinister?",
"i am so scared that i may have further complications, don 't think i can take anything more right now.",
"thank you czj, kat and thundercat for your advice and good wishes!",
"have spoken to my dsn, and been reassured that this is quite common in high heat, and as i have now returned to scotland, where it is cooler, i have found my ankles again!",
"still a bit puffy on the feet, but much better.",
"i also had the results of my recent blood tests, and my hba1c is down to 72, and considering it was 135 7 weeks ago, means that i am now coping with the new insulin regime, and eating correctly, yay me!!",
"i even managed to reduce my cholesterol too, so good news for a change.",
"i am a much happier bunny than i was, and having people to ""bounce off"" really helps, so thanks again.",
"i am just north of aberdeen, where it is roasting, but not as much as the south coast and london, can definitely feel the difference.",

"i am assured it will improve, just not sure when.",

would love to just feel normal again.... :sick:,
hi carb lo carb completely confused hello everyone i was diagnosed t2 in march this year.,
i have just had my first hba1c which was 5.9.,
i get average bs reading of around 5.5 before meals and 6.9 - 2 hours after my meal.,
when i saw my dietician for the first time she told me to increase my carbs as i had experienced several mild hypos (3.2 3.8) since then i have only had 1 hypo(3.9) since reading the posts on the forum i see that the subject of carb consumption is much more complicated than i thought.,
i was advised to take starch with all my meals.,
so i eat cereal and toast at breakfast ( i used to eat fresh fruit and low fat yoghurt for breakfast but by lunchtime my bs often dropped into the 3s causing me to feel faint and dizzy.,
"also i got a blinding headache and needed to sleep for a couple of hours) i have bread sandwiches or a baked potato at lunchtime and either pasta, rice or potatoes at suppertime.",
i try to keep my protein lowish usually 1 serving of meat or fish a day i eat lots of vegetables and salads + some fruit banana or soft fruit on cereal and a fresh fruit salad with my evening meal.,
i feel fine and i am gradually losing weight about 2lbs a month.,
i like the controlled energy that i get from a fairly high carb diet.,
so why is there such a down on carbs :?,
": as i understand it, sugar acts a bit like rocket fuel an intense boost of energy that is quickly used up (thanks to my meds) while the carbs offer a slow release of sugar - that sees me through to the next meal.",
.,
since increasing the carbs i have not suffered from a hypo so i assume my diet is right for me but the posts i have read here suggest otherwise.,
i would really appreciate the thoughts and advice of more experienced diabetics.,
"all the best gill thank you sue, noblehead sid and catherine cherub for your reasurring replies.",
i really appreciate it and iget the idea - it is as sid says - if its working dont fix it.,
to ian d a very big thank you for your long and careful post - i really appreciated all your comments.,
like you i am very surprised to learn i am diabetic.,
if it was not for the very high readings i had when first diagnosed i would dispute the diagnosis.,
but with an undiagnosed bs of 45 - i suppose there is no doubt?,
the first month my levels stayed in the double figures and i was thrilled when i got under 10.,
since then i rarely go above 7. i still use a little sugar - on my cereal and in my coffee - and still enjoy a sugar fest when my family come over for sunday tea.,
its very strange.,
when i was first diagnosed i was on max doses of metformin and glicazide but i am now on a reduced dosage of 2*750 mg of glucophage - the slow release metformin meds.,
i no longer take glicazide as my doc thought that was part of the reason for the hypos.,
"i wass told in hospital to increase my exercise - so as i feel so much more energetic i am back to gardening, cycling and the occasional swim when i can fit it in.",
at the moment the garden takes up a lot of time and energy if the bs levels stay as low as they are now - i am considering trying a diet/exercise regime with no meds.,
be interested in your thoughts.,
thank you again everyone i do enjoy belonging to this forum gill,
i am 38 years old and have been diabetic for 37 years now.,
unfortunately i am still smoking and i desperately want to stop.,
a little background info: my auntie who was also diabetic was a smoker and poorly controlled - she died from a heart attack after several strokes when she was in her mid-forties - this was probably 15 years ago now and she didn't have the luxury of a pen controlled life but nonetheless it is a big worry for me as i fear i'm going down the same route.,
my father is also diabetic and getting on in years now and has had an endless stream of ops cleaning out his arteries (angioplastys) as well as having to have a toe amputated.,
i live a pretty stressful life in video production and as a result find myself regularly falling back in to smoking - especially cannabis which seems to be the thing that always catches me out when i've stopped smoking in the past ( i have gone 4 years without smoking!).,
i've tried the patches but these seem too easy a way out without requiring the massive amount of will-power it takes to stick with it.,
i just feel weighed down (and have done so since my first joint when i was 21) by the pressure of diabetes and these impending complications that i have seen affect my family so profoundly.,
i don't want to die young let alone suffer all the other horrendous things that can happen to a diabetic but i feel trapped on a course to ruin at the moment.,
are there groups out there that can help me?,
if anyone has some magic words i sure would appreciate them... firstly thank you so much to everyone who has shared their experiences and in so doing given me so much help.,
it really is a strange overwhelming feeling when i realize that i am not alone in my battle.,
i think knowing that alone helps.,
it's so hard when you have to do something out of necessity rather than free choice - but i guess as time goes by it will be out of necessity so better to do it now while i have a bit of a choice.,
"the thing is i've tried the patches several times and it's been great for a few months or weeks sometimes, but then i inevitably find myself in a band practice and someone passes around a joint and the teenager in me just can't say no.",
"so i reckon to breaking the cycle it's much more about will power and as someone said, cutting down.",
"i think that any nicotine replacement therapy just lures you in to a false sense of security, and suddenly when temptation rears it's ugly head, you feel compelled once again.",
i actually think that because vie had diabetes for so long (37 years) and have grown up confronted with the grim reality of what can happen (my dad is currently in hospital with acute resting angina from blocked up arteries) that i've actually cut myself from it all.. and it's only be reading your comments that i start to get a grip on the reality of the situation.,
so thank you.,
"sue, your journey and life with work and diabetes sound horrendous, trying to cope with a debilitating disease on top of everything else.",
it sounds like the golden hand shake is the best option.,
try and find some work you could do from home?,
"thanks all, steve",
"hi, i was diagnosed as type 1 at the beginning of the year and put straight onto insulin with no tests done what so ever.",
my hba1c at the time came out to be 91.,
"as a consequence i completely changed my diet, no snacks, cut down processed carbs and reduced my carb intake to between 150 - 200 g a day.",
my hba1c was taken again in august and was down to 40.,
"happy days, my gp was delighted and so was i. i recently had it taken again at the hospital and it was 41.",
great.,
or so i thought...,
the diabetes doctor told me that i had to try and bring it up to about 50.,
does this sound right to you?,
"i am now starting to question my diagnosis, is it correct?",
i take 8 units of lantus daily and between 0-5 units of novorapid per meal.,
"i know that this is a really small amount, but i figured i was still in the honeymoon phase.",
"if i do snack, or mis calculate my carbs my bs does go up and i can quite easily get it into double figures if i want.",
pre breakfast my bs can be anywhere between 5-8 depending.,
"my bs as a whole recently has been pretty good, but i have just moved house and have been doing about 2 hours of diy every night.",
any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated donnellysdogs said: ambersilva...,
your consultant may not sign off your licence unless you get higher hba level...,
the dvla or consultant will not believe you if you say you recognise every hypo either....,
they will then think that you are not actually recognising any.,
i have actually been told this by a person at dvla.... be careful everyone if you are t1 and a driver with running your hba1c's under 6.0...,
honestly you run the risk of being scrutinised by the dvla.... click to expand...,
thanks for that donnellysdogs.,
"i can see where they are coming from as you don't want anyone dropping unconscious at the wheel whilst having a hypo, but on the other hand it feels like they are punishing good behaviour too.",
if i am able to keep my hba1c at a really good level then surely that is a good thing as i will cost the nhs a lot less in the long run as i will hopefully not encounter any diabetic related issues that will cost them even more money.,
"it does seem to depend on who you talk to as my gp was happy, but my diabetic dr was not.",

but what about the arms/stomach?,
"is it weird to be doing that at a dinner table, or in a cinema, something like that?",
"it feels strange, my friends are all used to it but it feels like i should be going somewhere more private to do it?",
another question following that actually - is it possible to do an injection through my clothes (assuming they're thin) or will i end up with some sort of deathly infection?,
"just an idea, would be nice if i could do it through my trouser-leg when i'm out, as i sometimes run out of 'public' places to inject.",

nice.,
welcome everybody i might find someone here who agrees with me and here too some people will not care about the subject personally i think there is a line in the difficulty of determining the degree of diabetes in every human being for example : is there a difference between two people have one hba1c 6.2% and other have 6.6% if we talk medically they will say the first is not diabetic and the second is diabetic.,
"although there is no big difference i suggest an idea why we do not take digital names that can identify a patient with a taste each person exceeds 5.4% example 5.5% that's mean diabetes(-90%) 5.6% = diabetes (-80%) 5.7= diabetes(-70%) 6.3%=diabetes(-10%) 6.4=diabetes(exactly) 6.5%=diabetes(+10%) and so on just idea kk123 said: blimey hicham, as if it's not complicated enough already!",

the percentage of the disease should be determined by a percentage thus doctors can deal with the patient better and more precisely guzzler said: i honestly beleive that earlier diagnosis is more important than perfecting the glycation ranges.,
raised blood glucose as shown by the a1c is perhaps the last symptom of t2.,
why not pour resources into a test that would detect the condition earlier or at least flag up those who are at risk?,

"hi everyone, this is my first post.",
"i have t2 and have been diet control for about two years now, my gp has now put me on metformin 500mg 1 tab for the first week 2 tabs for 2nd week and then 3 tabs after that, but i do like a drink of ale.",
but the info that comes with the metformin said no drinking what do i do?,
with thanks gadget.,
"thanks carol, i am thinking about not taking the metformin as when i do have a drink it's about 3-4 points at a time, i do not drink all the time but when i do i like a good one with my friends.",
my last drink was new years eve.,
"not sure what to do, should i stop the metformin 3 or 4 days before drinking?",
thanks again gadget mo1905 said: i take metformin and drink beer etc !,
no problem at all.,
"sent from the diabetes forum app click to expand... hi mo, how much do you drink if i may ask?",
lazybones said: alcohol is know to interact with good control of blood glucose levels and can slow down the uptake of blood glucose.,
also you should be aware that when first going on metformin there are a few known side effects that is often why indivuals are slowly weaned onto metformin.,
it would think it best to stay off the alcohol until you are weaned onto the full dose of metformin as one of the common initial side effects is an upset tummy and possibly diarrohea which a few people experience until their digestive system becomes accustomed to the metformin.,
you will also need to be cautious of some beer/ales/lagers as many have a high hidden sugar content.,
however in saying that i've been on metformin myself for this last year (2 x 500mg daily) and i regularly drink just one small glass of cider and occasionally i might have as an alternative have just the one measure of spirits and i have never personally experienced any problem.,
i dare say someone here on this site can shed more light on the question of alcohol and metformin.,
.,
"click to expand... thank you for your help, my prob is i love ale and go to ale festivals, where i would have more than one drink.",
"okay thanks guys & girls, i think i will keep on taking the metformin but i will tell my gp that i am drinking ale with it for now.",
"thank you all very much for the information gadget here is what i found out, the signs of lactic acidosis are deep and rapid breathing, vomiting, and abdominal pain.",
these symptoms are not specific for lactic acidosis.,
"the deep breathing ( kussmaul breathing ), which occurs in other types of metabolic acidosis, arises as an attempt to reduce blood acidity by exhaling carbon dioxide .",
"the list of signs and symptoms of lactic acidosis includes the following: nausea vomiting hyperventilation abdominal pain lethargy anxiety severe anemia hypotension irregular heart rate tachycardia hi guy's and girls, here is an update.",
"i got a call from my pharmacy asking me if was was okay with the metformin and it's side effects, i told him i was okay on it.",
"i then asked him about drinking with it, he said why did i ask?",
"so i told him about the info sheet and it said no drinking he asked who made the one i have, told him it was bristol, he then check and said it should not say that and he was going to e-mail the makers today, and will let me know what they say.",
so i had a beer!!!,
and yes i am now taking 2 tabes a day 3 next week.,
a big thanks to all of you for the help.,
gadget,
i have t2dm and eat low carb organic or wild food.,
my gp is neutral on that and my ophthalmic consultant very much pro organic.,
"i saw a dsn who was against low carb and in the end i resorted to distracting her with my husband (who was an nhs manager then) so they had a chinwag about other stuff instead imo, food is the first line of attack against diabetes, so i'm invested in giving my body the right nutrition.",
"to me, that means removing all processed carbohydrates firstly, so that the carbs in my diet come from natural sources only.",
i feel that it makes sense to remove foods which my body has problems processing.,
"the second step, for me, was to remove as many of the additives and pesticide residues as i could by going organic.",
"this should mean also, that i'm not ingesting second-hand genetically modified organisms, antibiotics and growth hormones.",
"currently, i'm working on a document to list the nutritional content (where stated) of everything i buy.",
i want to go to my gp and get tested for b12 for example along with my routine bloods.,
"my plan is then, is either to take gp up on his dietician offer or seek an appointment with a nutritional therapist.",
"so, i'm interested in hearing your experiences with nhs dieticians, especially if you low carb.",
"secondly, there is a nutritional therapist in the next town, with a degree in nutrition from an aussie uni.",
an appointment with her is 50 for an hour.,
has anyone consulted a nutritional therapist or non-nhs dietician ?,
thanks in advance !,
thank you all for the replies !,
"x what i want, is for someone to be able to pinpoint micronutrients which i might need to eat more of.",
"my approach was to google lists of foods from many sources, which came up as being pancreas-friendly, heart-friendly, liver-friendly kidney-friendly etc and try to make sure that i eat as many of them as i can within the low carb framework.",
"i haven't dug into the antioxidant, flavonoid, plant sterol etc micronutrients.",
"also, i don't want to exclude something which newer research shows could be a positive thing for my health, if i can eat it, i have noticed that low carb advocates all seem to differ on vegetables.",
"radishes, carrots, fennel, celeriac, swede, butternut squash and pumpkin are allowed or forbidden by different people.",
"if i knew how much of the vegetable was considered the optimal nutrient-giving amount, i could check with my meter and decide whether i needed to find an alternate, instead of just ditching all of those.",
"it is sounding like nhs dieticians do the same as the dns, ie toe the nhs line.",
if they aren't up to date with new thinking and research then i think i'd be wasting my time.,
i certainly wouldn't want another bullying lecture on eating porridge.,
maybe it would be a good idea to ask questions of the nutritional therapist and see how current she is.,
if i come away from an appointment with lots of ideas to explore the 50 would be worth it.,
"if i came away thinking i could have googled that, it wouldn't be.",
"supposedly, professionals have access to paper on nutrition and attend conferences etc that i, as a lay person, don't have access to.",
"wow, life is certainly too short to wait two years to see a dietician and i thought waiting 6 weeks to see a physio was a long wait !",
"sometimes all this reading does my head in and besides online, i've got a pile of books on diabetes and low carbing by my bed.",
it would be nice to encounter professionals who could explain it all.,
dr sarah hallberg did a vlog in which she said that if you eat right you don't need supplements but if you want insurance take these and i forgot to write them down.,
#infooverload.,
"it's not as scary as it was at first, and i feel lucky that i was able to email doctors and researchers abroad and have them give me answers.",
without them i would have stayed on the low fat high carb diet and deteriorated rapidly.,
"we shouldn't have to do this though, the doctors went to medical school.",
"from reading another thread, it is clear that others experience the same symptoms that i do.",
"i wake a few times of night feeling hot, so my sleep quality is not good.",
"i have a freestyle monitor and i have tested my blood sugars on each waking - there is no particular change in my blood sugar which would be an "" explanation"" of this.",
i.e.,
it does not seem to be dawn phenonemon.,
"it would be useful if others could perhaps comment on whether they also experience this, or if they used to , but it has got better since, could they comment on anything they did to resolve it, or if it went away inexplicably?",
bulkbiker said: i used to wake a lot to pee in the night (3-4 times per night).. probably the excess sugars being excreted.,
since going very low carb and getting bloods under control i usually sleep through until the bloody dog or cat decide to wake me up to be let out!,
"click to expand... that's very interesting, there are not many people on here with truly normal hba1c , other than you!",
according to this research - averse effects start to come into being once the hba1c rises above 4.6% (27) https://chriskresser.com/when-your-normal-blood-sugar-isnt-normal-part-2/ i don't suppose you can recall how far into your program you have got before the sleep issues went away ?,
or how many months of doing the low carb diet ?,
this is a technical explanation of why a low carb diet can cause disturbed sleep.,
"i have tried to weigth my 25 g of carbs towards dinner - by eating a bigger portion of cabbage ( 150g and some other low carb mixed vegetables ( 150g cauli mash, mushrooms) , i have actually stayed asleep for a whole four hours - in the last two nights as a result which is an improvement- but my blood sugars have also gone up as well - fasting low sixes instead of high fives.",

https://www.amazon.co.uk/swanson-l-...coding=utf8&psc=1&refrid=f85jdpwpdrg2jmfnx2sk next question !,
( i do ask an awful lot of questions !,
"in the quest t understand this .....) if you have reported that you have problems staying asleep at night, do you know if you also snore?",
"if you have recovered from the problem, do you know if you also stopped snoring?",
snoring is considered to be a risk factor ( or side effect lol) of diabetes .,
i have been known to wake the dead on occasion ( including an entire cinema subjected to watching (imho) the dreadful and interminable fantastic beasts movie which was so bad as to induce unconsciousness!,
anyone have any input on this question - any help would be really appreciated.,
i have drug induced type 2 and was okay on diet and excercise having tried metformin but it didn't suit.,
my fasting blood sugar is under 7 although after eating it can get up to 13.,
i now have high levels of ketones after eating my evening meal.,
my dr tells me that ketones should only be there if you are starving yourself and this is not the case as is shown by the steep rise in blood sugar levels.,
it apparently means that no glucose is being taken from the bloodstream and i either have to take diamicron at a very low dose or go straight onto insulin.,
now for the but....the literature says that it is not safe and is contraindicated to take diamicron with high levels of ketones.,
'hopefully it will be safe to take a low dose as you are not fully ketone acidotic' wasn't quite what i wanted to hear.,
i have been offered no reason why i have ketones after eating but dr agrees that it needs sorting and quickly.,
i have an appointment with an endocrinologist but not for another 6 weeks.,
has anyone else had this complication and can offer any advice.,
my gp is quite amenable to suggestions but i seem to be left a bit in the dark here and am resisting adding in yet another medication.,
thanks for the info and the links.,
my 2 hour pp bs is around 13 but was told this didn't matter unless my fasting was consistently over 7 (which it isn't - runs between 6 and 6.8).,
the ketone level after eating is frequently at top end of the scale but normally mid to high range.,
as i am hours away from an a&e i am sure my gp would be the port of call but not knowing what the serious symptoms i would need to look out for in the first place i will just have to wait 6 weeks to see the endocrinologist.,
opted against the diamicron for the moment.,
what exactly happens after you take metformin that causes the hair to start falling out?,
they took it off the side-effects list.,
is there someone that it didn't happent to him?,
is there someone that it did happen to him and managed to stop it?,
please share...,
thanks,
hi i am a newbie to this forum and would like some advice.,
"i was diagnosed with pre-diabetes (igt) last october and my gp advised that i should just continue with my already healthy eating and active lifestyle and my blood sugar levels would be monitored regularly with a further gtt in october-he stated that i did not need any medical intervention until such time as i was diagnosed with full blown diabetes, which hopefully i will be able to resisit for a good while yet.",
"however, i saw an endocrinologist the other day about unexplained weight gain/query under active thyroid and the first thing he said is that he will be writing to my gp to tell him to put me on metformin but i don't yet have diabetes so don't understand why he wants me on metformin.",
hope you can clarify this for me.,
"many thanks hi sue thanks for your prompt response i have got to have a batch of blood tests for the problems i saw the endo for, but he hasn't included blood sugar levels, and to be honest, he never even asked what my levels were after the gtt!",
i do test my levels intermittently with a home kit and the readings 2 hours after food are averaging 6.1-6.5 so don't think they are excessive.,
i am reluctant to start taking tablets for a condition which i don't actually have yet!,
"sue no, my age precludes pcos-i'm 56!",
the endo is considering the possibility of cushings syndrome-a disorder of the adrenal/pituitary glands.,
"when i told him about pre-diabetes and that i wasn't on medication he said that a study in the us where igt patients were given metaformin or a placebo, the patients taking metaformin showed much reduced incidence of going on to develop full diabetes than those on the placebo so he obviously thinks that all igt patients should go on to metaformin!!",
hi have not logged on for a few days so apologies for not responding to last few replies which gave such useful info.,
i went to have the blood tests for the query underactive thyroid and told the practice nurse about the endo's recommendations to start on metformin and she said the gp would be very reluctant to put me on the tablets until i am actually diagnosed with full blown diabetes.,
she stated that the metformin would regulate my blood sugar levels to such an extent that it would mask diabetes when i eventually develop it!,
i am going to wait till the endo sends the letter and then discuss it with the gp but i am not due to see the endo again for 3 months unless blood tests throw up some positives so to be honest i feel as if i am stuck in the middle if the gp and endo have conflicting views.,
i'll keep you posted!,
hanadra-i agree with you about the 'fsa healthy plate' and my gp practice diet sheet given to me is also strongly biased towards carbohydrates!,
iv'e also found that many low fat options are loaded with sugar!,
katharine thanks for that-it certainly puts things into perspective for me and highlights the advantages of taking metformin!,
any diabetic here who is doing bodybuilding?,
ringi said: what is your aim with bodybuilding?,
click to expand...,
it was my childhood dream to get into bodybuilding... but last year at the age of 19 i was diagnosed with this diabetes maybe because of overeating and being overweight ...however i decided even with this condition i am going to go for it and i decided to cut on all carbs but i am lil confused whether i should take whey protein or not?,
alexandra100 said: @mbaker does.,
"i myself regularly do weight training, but i wouldn't call it bodybuilding.",
you might like this site: https://diabetesstrong.com click to expand... do u take any diet ?,
ringi said: the issue is that the diets many bodybuilders use to win competitions is not good for anyone with type2.,
"yet the gym work they do, combined with a high protein diet can greatly reduce insulin resistance, and hence help control type2.",
"by keeping to a low carb, high protein diet, along with the gym work, you could do bodybuilding to a level that impresses all your friends etc........ (just avoid all the ""magic"" shakes etc, and keep to the steak and eggs.)",
"click to expand... yeah , you are very right .",
high protein and no carbs thats the formula alexandra100 said: absolutely go for it!!!,
no-one can answer your question about whey protein until you give details about your blood sugar levels and what you are eating at present.,
what tests have you had?,
are you doing finger prick testing with a meter at home?,
when i first arrived on this forum i was afraid of boring people if i gave too much detail.,
from the very first replies i got i realised that the more detail given the better people are pleased and the better we can help.,
"click to expand... well, initially i was put on janumet xr by doctor ... but after some time i decided to go to gym again and things started to go pretty well thereafter ... my blood sugar usually is around 80-90 fasting and 150-170 after meal and less than 130 2 hours after eating a meal ... my aic was 5.8%...i dont take any meds right now trying to balance my diet and exercise",
