title,Can pregnancy hormones cause high blood sugar levels?
question,"I know it sounds a silly question but for the passed two weeks I've been feeling constantly exhausted, fighting high BGL almost daily and then today I've been feeling a little nauseous (but then I did take Kalms Night last night which can cause nausea apparently). I'm due on my period this week so I don't have any massive cause for concern ... and I'm on the pill but I can't help wondering if there's more to it?

I thought coming on here would be better than googling  any advice would be appreciated!"

comment 2: ,"Yes, it's possible that early pregnancy or implantation can cause highs. But do you know what is a much better way to find out if you could be pregnant than googling or asking forums? Peeing on a stick.

comment 3: ,"I already did ... it was negative so I'm trying to be a bit more objective about how I'm feeling and other possible causes. I guess it's just a case of waiting to see what happens. I just wondered if anyone had experienced high bloods in early pregnancy.

I already did ... it was negative so I'm trying to be a bit more active about how I'm feeling and other possible causes. I guess it's just a case of waiting to see what happens. I just wondered if anyone had experienced high bloods in early pregnancy.Click to expand...

If I remember rightly, I did. Breathlessness with tiredness. Unbeknown at the time, pregnant and raised bgs. Metformin wasn't enough. Once confirmed after a negative pregnancy test I was introduced to insulin. 
2nd pregnancy was very similiar.
Good luck!

comment 5: ,"Take another test over a week if your period is late. You could be just taking it too early. I took a test before newyear thinking I will double check before I drink and it came back negative and then still my period didn't come so I checked when I was 10 day late and I was pregnant!!

comment 6: ,"Yes, pregnancy can cause high sugars early on. I think my higher sugars started at around 5weeks, but I had other signs of pregnancy before I tested. I never bother testing until my period is due, as I don't find the early tests accurate. So my advice is to,assume you might be (ie avoid alcohol, etc) and test again.
