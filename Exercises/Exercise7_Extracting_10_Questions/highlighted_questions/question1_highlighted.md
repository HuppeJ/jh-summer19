**question** 

We often see people here ```asking about why their blood sugars aren't behaving themselves```.

More often than not, it really helps to test at certain set times of the day to discover patterns in your readings.
Logging your blood glucose results  and carbohydrate intake, along with meds can help you physically see patterns and often identify the problem foods or times of the day and can open up a new view on your situation, helping you to resolve it.

I've created a spreadsheet using Microsoft Excel which i'd like to share with those ```having trouble identifying problems with their control as this has really helped me in the past```.

By Monitoring closely and entering your results into the spreadsheet, you will hopefully see a pattern imerge from the chart where your results are plotted, allowing you to identify what's going "wrong".

The log book is pre-sized for an A4 print out too, so you can also print your results with ease.

Thanks! I've printed it for T1 husband who has a review coming up.

Excellent, thanks Stu.

Not wanting to be critical but the things you are suggesting seem very similar to DAFNE so why not ask to go on the course if you haven't done it. DAFNE is fantastic I swear by it. If you stick to its principles which are very simple, and fill in the diary, which is I suppose a spredsheet that takes into account the things you have mentioned, it works great. 
I have used spreadsheets and used the software linked to meters but DAFNE far outweighs anything. Also if anyone decices to use the spread sheet the best thing is to print out a blank and fill it in by hand as you go, otherwise you will never get the benefit. This is a simple rule of monitoring  and recording results  if you do it by entering results durectly on to a PC or laptop you will always be doing it retrospectively.
Sorry to pour cold water but this is my experience.
Cheers

thanks for your comments! 

I dont disagree that DAFNE works. Im doing a course similar to that now. Not everyone can get on a DAFNE course though, or they have a long wait, which is why i wanted to offer something that might help.

You can learn a lot on the DAFNE type courses and well worth doing if you can.

The spreadsheet is printable so it can be filled in by hand if that is the preference.

DAFNE isn't available in Portsmouth, although the diabetic clinic do run education courses. ```Anything that helps to easily track blood glucose is welcome```.

If anyone is using Accu-check meters you can get an IR lead and Compass software to transfer the meter readings to the pc, for free. The program is quite good, it gives reports on day/week averages. You can transfer the data via IR or enter it manually. You can also enter carbs and execrsize data. 

I called them last week about ```a problem I was having with the Mulitclix and also asked them about the IR on the meter itself```. They sent me the complete kit but ```I am still waiting for the COM to USB converter, they had run out``` but promised to sent me one when they get them back in stock.

the Rapid column is for your rapid acting insulin.

You have Basal insulin - background insulin
You have Bolus insulin - for meal times and corrections

Some people use a mixed insulin...

Do you know what you are using?


Thanks for the feedback... i think i might adjust the titles on there, i can see how it could be confusing to newly diagnosed. I did have another version of the spreadsheet for Mixed insulin where you take insulin before breakfast and before evening meal, ill see if i can find it.

Ahhhh doh! that makes sense 
I am on metformin once a day. Thanks again

the spread sheet is very similar to the logbook that my meter uses one touch ultra smart and has a lot of different readouts.

StuBoy, thank you!!  Genius!!!  I will now use that IN ADDITION to all the other means that i use to log in my ultimate quest to be fully controlled again.

Thanks again.
