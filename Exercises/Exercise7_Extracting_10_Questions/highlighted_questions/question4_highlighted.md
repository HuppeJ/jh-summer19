**question**

my daughter has just brought chicken pox home from school and i wanted to know is this dangerous to diabetics as it is to people with asthma. one of our friends down the road said they read something about it be harmful to diabetics but ```i havent found any litrature```. ```Does this mean i can go on holiday for 2 weeks```  8)

Hmmm ... just remember that diabetics usually take longer to heal or get over a virus/bug and some will already have a compromised immune system as will some asthmatics.

It's quite unpleasant (rather than dangerous) for any adult, so if you've never had it before I'd make yourself scarce if possible, though that might be difficult as it's your daughter who has it!

Sadly, there's no point in vacating the premises now, as you've been exposed to the contageous period for a good 5 days now :-(

Once you've had Chicken pox, you cannot contract it again, however the varicella-zoster virus does lie dormant in your system for the rest of your life and can return at a future date as Shingles. I've had both, and Chicken Pox was a walk in the park compared to shingles.

Getting Chicken pox for the first time as an adult does make for a nastier time of it, but complications are pretty rare, even for those with an underlying medical condition.

Personal question (sorry), but if there's any chance you might be pregnant you might want to see your GP as CP is one of those things to be avoided like the plague during PG.

Hope your daughter has a fairly easy time of it, and that her 'itchies' don't drive her (or you!) round the bend too much!

My mum was hospitalised with chicken pox at age 16 because she was so sick.  I remember getting them when I was about 7 but didn't have a serious case at all.  I had my older son vaccinated early when it was not a part of the schedule but Khaleb has been vaccinated as is routine for this country.  The majority of children are now vaccinated here through schools if they have not been done beforehand.

Hope your daughter recovers quickly.

Had chickenpox as a child & also as an adult in my twenties. At the time the Doctor  advised me you can have chicken pox many times. Have got fingers crossed as my grand daughter has just been infected & I am now 68!

Interesting that......what the Dr said (many times) doesn't appear to be strictly correct if you read through the below link from the NHS, although I have heard of people like yourself who have had it more than once. I fortunately have only had it the once........

There are several theories that could explain how someone might get chickenpox more than once. Some examples are explained below. 

â€¢ Many medical professionals believe that the personâ€™s condition was misdiagnosed first time around, and that they had another condition with similar symptoms. 

â€¢ There may be a genetic link. In the US studies mentioned above, around half of the people who reported having chickenpox before said that other members of their family had also had chickenpox more than once. 

â€¢ There may be more than one strain of the chickenpox virus. If this is the case, it may be possible for someone to be infected by a different strain each time. However, there is no scientific evidence to support this theory.Click to expand...
