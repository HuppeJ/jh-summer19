title,Gluten Free Baking
question,"I recently bought a book The Joy of Gluten-free, Sugar-free Baking. 
Solutions for celiac disease, diabetes and weight loss.

I am waiting for ingredients to arrive so not tested them yet.

The writers are American and there is no nutritional values for the recipes. I put a couple of recipes into my fitness Pal and they are very low carb.

I got my copy from eBay."

comment 2: ,"Interesting because gluten free products bought in the UK are often heavier in carbs than the wheat based equivalent.
I would be really interested in further information if you wouldn't mind posting once the products arrive?
Could I ask what the books title is and authors names?

Thank you very much

comment 3: ,"I tend to find that a low carb recipe is likely to be gluten free, but if it isn't, then it is easier to replace the gluteny products, rather than going for a gluten free recipe and then tweaking it to make it low carb.

Did that actually make sense?
I know what I mean, but do you?

I do know what you mean!

The recipes contain various nut flours and seeds.

I am not a natural baker, I need ingredients and instructions.
