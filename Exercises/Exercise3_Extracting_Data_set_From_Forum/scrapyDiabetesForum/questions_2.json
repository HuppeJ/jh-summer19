{"question": "Hi I was wondering if anyone gets a weird smell like urine, that only they can smell. Its driving me mental and keep thinking its coming off me when I know it isnt."},
{"question": "Hi guys."},
{"question": "I wonder if anyone could tell me if they have had a similar reaction."},
{"question": "So I have now had diabetes for 7 weeks."},
{"question": "Hi! I did ask this question earlier, but it never appeared so maybe I did something wrong! Anyway, as a diet only T2, I'm about to have my first Hba1c test since diagnosis. All my reading on the subject tells me that fasting is not necessary for this test as it's an average over 3 months. I checked with my surgery, but the specialist diabetes nurse told me I must fast for 10 hours before the test. I queried it, but she insists dieting is needed before a Hba1c. Is she right?? If not, how can a specialist in the subject be wrong like this? Your views would be appreciated."},
{"question": "Hey everyone,"},
{"question": "Hello,"},
{"question": "Have you noticed that all the thread titles now seem to be forced into US title case, ie every single word is capitalised?"},
{"question": "I have recently found out my son has type 1 diabetes. Please can someone suggest where to buy 'sugar free' squash from as we have been informed he cant have 'no added sugar'. I have tried Asda, Tesco, Co-op, Sainsburys and Lidl with no joy. There are plenty of sugar free fizzy but non to dilute."},
{"question": "Apart from artificial sweeteners - has anyone researched this product and perhaps other 'Zero' drinks please?"},
{"question": "I have blurred vision today since waking up (a few hours ago).  I am trying to tell myself to stay calm, it will go away etc, but to be honest, I am freaking out."},
{"question": "This poll is totally anonymous - even administrators can't see who's voted!"},
{"question": "Hi,"},
{"question": "Hello Everyone,"},
{"question": "I know the advice is to test at 2hrs or 1hr after starting a meal.  However I just did a test after 30 mins and got a much bigger reading.  Is this what you would expect ?  I thought the idea of testing at 1hr was to catch the peak reading (ie after giving the food time to get into the blood).  Or is the 1hr measurement supposed to be checking that the level has come down quickly enough ?"},
{"question": "I read so many articles saying that marijuana can actually improve the health of diabetics. Is this for real?"},
{"question": "Anyone else find that their blood sugar can rise without having anything to eat or drink in the morning ?"},
{"question": "HI,"},
{"question": "I have been put on novomix 30 2weeks ago my sugars have been high cos my dose is not the right obe yet i done 43 about 2hours ago and its reading hi what should i do ketons say lo"},
{"question": "Hi there,"}
