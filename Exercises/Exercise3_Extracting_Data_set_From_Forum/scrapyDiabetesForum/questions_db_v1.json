One of the things she's testing for is blood glucose. I didn't say anything to her about having done a couple of tests myself already.

When the increase of the 2 IGF'd are added to each other the doctors claim is that they are 100% better at digestihg glucose in the body . He claims the pharmasutical companys have total knowlage of this research but do not want to use it as in America alone it would cost them $250 million a year in lost revenue .

I saw a nurse today and she said these episodes could be hypos/hypers, and that my low blood pressure , which causes me to feel dizzy and lose my vision, could also be linked to my glucose levels.

My stepfather has type 2 diabetes. In September 2009 I noticed that he had a small black area under his toenail. His doctor said it was a blood blister, which I thought was not a proper diagnosis, as it hadn't disappeared by December of 2009. Haven't looked at his feet much until today. Now he has four blackened areas under four toenails and two small black areas on one toe toward the end of the toe by the foot. I know this is dead or dying tissue.

Second, I can't make him. I am a nurse and have educated him about this for years. He chooses to ignore education and advice from everyone, including his own doctors. My stepfather has selective hearing and hears only what he wants to hear. Eg. The doctor told him that he needed to delete all sugar from his diet. My stepfather heard, \"I need to adjust my insulin if I want sugars.\" You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink. This fits my stepfather completely!!! He is making his life choices. All I can do is educate. He has been to several specialists regarding his neuropathy. The conclusion is that he has absolutely no feeling in his feet and legs when pricked with a needle. The neuropathy has now run its course and is rampant throughout his body, affecting his gastrointensinal system. His heart is, so far unaffected, as he passed his stress test. I don't think that this will last and that eventually his heart will also be affected. He has eye problems, specifically diabetic retinopathy, as well as a possibility of open angle glaucoma. He feels that he should live his life the way he wants to, darn the consequences. We have 5 family members that are in the medical field and we can't make him understand what he is doing to himself. Neither can the doctor's or nurses that he has seen over the last 10 years. In the meantime, we just keep plugging away at education and he keeps ignoring it. He is depressed and takes medication, but refuses to see a psychiatrist. We do the best we can. That's all we can do.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t", "\u00a0", "\n\t\t\t\t\t"]},

For about 18 months I have suffered extreme night time sweating with insomnia that typically comes on around 2-4am at night.  At one point i thought I would have to leave work since I was so tired because the night time was proving so traumatic for me. Typically I would have a healthy tea around 8pm and then usually top this off later and spoil it with biscuits and or cake or anything sweet really.  I am very slim do a lot of exercise, but  get bad sweet cravings and would typically follow this eating pattern every night picking on sugary food right up til bed.   I would then awake around 4am when the room was freezing cold due it being Winter, and I would be burning up and be soaked with sweat.  Despite the extremely low temperature of the room I would remain too hot and unable to sleep until about 5-6am.  At about 6am my body temp returns to normal and I feel cold againa as I should and put the duvet back on and can then finally sleep.  I went to the Doctor who asked if I was worried or anxious.  (At that point i wanted to throw something at him). So I spent 6 more months in misery.

Why won't they understand, I'm talking extreme heat which causes the insomnia not stress :x  Anyway, he then said he would do a blood test.  My question are:  Does it sound like reactive hypo and if so, would a fasting blood test fail to pick it up?

So here goes. Since diagnosis in January, I followed what I had been advised was a healthy diet, with plenty of whole grains, fruit etc. I was frustrated that my blood glucose remained in the mid to high teens despite oral medication. Clearly I was making several basic mistakes when I thought I was eating healthily. Other forum members educated me about LCHF eating, which I decided to try. Over the next week, my blood glucose levels came right down & I was able to reduce my medication. I was eating around 50g of carbs a day when I first began clean eating & LCHF. But, For the last month, maybe a little longer, I've reduced this even more as I want to stop my prescribed Gliclazide completely, preferring to be on Metformin only. My carb intake right now is no more than 20g, & to be honest usually much much less. I haven't got much of an appetite so suspect my intake is low in calories too. When testing, my Ketostix indicate my Ketone level at 4.0, which is \"Moderate.\" This is with a BG level of 5.5 on average. Members have told me that I have reached nutritional ketosis & that my body is now burning fat in the absence of carbs. So, since reducing my carbs to less than 20g each day, my weight loss has increased and with my current level of ketosis, I'm losing on average 1LB per day. This week alone I have lost 5LB since Sunday. And last week I lost 6LB. My husband & family have commented on how skinny I'm becoming...which I'm not. But in comparison to what I was 4 months ago, I'm over 3 stone lighter. But the rapid weight loss has certainly been more evident since my diet changed to very low carb.

Or if you are reading this during the evening maybe a glass of the red juice! Maybe it doesnt have to be evening.....or red! Just make yourself comfy. Here goes....", "\n", "\nI joined this amazing forum towards the end of last year following my shock diagnosis. Worried sick. Clueless apart from the Eat well drawing in my hand, done very roughly by hand (in my very first appointment where you are still in shock) by my diabetic nurse, who also confirmed that this beast that was now inside me was progressive. I would need drugs, and more drugs and maybe insulin. She was the same nurse who had treated my mum for about 10 years before her death 11 years ago. I thought 'she knows best, im doomed'. I knew my mum's had been progressive so why would i even question her statement. The good news was that basically i could eat what i liked but just had to cut down on sugar. I could eat plenty of starchy carbs with a low GI, eat plenty of fruit and veg, cut down on fat, choose low fat dairy, lean meat, blah blah blah. You know the script as you had exactly the same no doubt. All backed up on the nhs website. The threat of metformin was hanging over me as my hba1c was over 48 (62). I shudder at the thought of having to take tablets as my mum was offered thalidamide when she was pregnant with me as she was so sick. Thankfully for me she did not take them. I know metformin works well and has been going for years but i just wanted to see if maybe, just maybe, i could reverse my diagnosis with diet alone. I had heard reversal was possible. I knew it was as a very close member of my family had a gastric bypass and the t2d disappeared over night more or less. I didnt want to go down the same path as my poor mum who eventually ended up on insulin, registered blind, high BP, stroke and leg wounds that were proving difficult to treat. So i googled 'reversing diabetes' and this was the first site i came to - thankfully it wasn't diabetes.org! And i have never looked back. I learned so much from all the amazing people who are very happy and willing to share their knowledge and can never thank them enough. And also the abundance of info on the site itself. I started on the LCHF Woe. The weight dropped off me. I went back to the DN with my project book in hand, my weight loss details, my BS readings. She said 'nobody has done what you are doing'. I checked what she had just said. 'Nobody....ever....in all the years?'. She replied 'Not one person has come through that door ever doing what you are doing, they look to me as their google and just follow my advice'. I could not believe it because by this point my BS had come down to non diabetic levels (41). All through diet. And not the one recommended!! Meds were not mentioned. I told her on my 2nd appointment about the diet i was on and she rolled her eyes. I said it would only be until i reversed things as i thought that the HF might cause health issues. She was happy with that. I asked for the 2nd appointment specifically for her to check my hba1c and cholesterol. That was 6th feb and it hba1c came back as 47 (pre diabetic) but i knew i was on the right track and felt happy to continue. Cholestrol was ok too. And now i feel happy to stay on this woe permanently as i dont want to get back into that same boat ever again. Plus i know that the HF part is nothing to concern myself over.", "\n", "\nWhen i lost 3 stone i wrote up my journey details in the forum thread 'success stories and testimonials'. Dajana from the press office linked to the site contacted me asking if she could go to the local paper and maybe even national papers with my story. Yes, absolutely, spread the word. And within a short period of time i was in touch with my local gazette who sent around a photographer. I sent my story to them by email and i spoke to the journalist on the phone. She only confirmed my age as she said everything she needed to know was in my write up. My story went in the paper a week ago today. The journalist had edited quite a lot out but still kept much of the important info in so i was happy enough. She apologised and said it was a specific template but hoped she had done my story justice. When i saw me on the FRONT of the gazette at the check out in the sainsburys superstore at 10.30am i nearly choked on my adonis bar!!! I was expecting it that day but in the afternoon when they usually arrive in the shops. I quickly bought a copy....and another 6 just in case. Not sure of what but i thought i better had anyway. What if everyone wants a copy as soon as they see this story of reversing diabetes. Surely everyone would want to read about it. All diabetics would want to know how i did it. I went online and sure enough it was there too! I thought i better get myself home and at my pc ready to answer the influx of questions. I was so excited to spread the word.....", "\n", "\nTo date only one comment has been left!!! ", "\n", "\nGutted is an understatement. Then a couple of days ago it popped up on my facebook feed. And the comments started!!! I can't  tell you how happy i was sitting here on my orange box talking of finger pricking, testing, remission, weight loss, low carb, high fat and people were interested. But to me this is a drop in the ocean. As happy as i am to reply and help if i can, it's  not enough. I could send my story template to magazines, national papers in the hope it might get published but i know now the response would not be what my heart would yearn for, to ultimately get the message over that they are treating diabetes wrong, giving out bad advice which is ultimately making the disease progressive. Putting patients on meds immediately (my friend wants to stay on them so he can eat what he wants even though i have explained this isn't the case, this is not emphasised enough at the outset and if it was maybe people might try this diet). The doctors get more money i believe when a patient is put on meds and the pharma companies make billions from it. Not to mention slimming products and weight loss programmes etc. And the food industry continue to profit from heavily prossessed foods making us hungrier than ever. Viscious circle.", "\n", "\nSo my question is this, i am one tiny voice. Nobody can really hear me. As loud as i am shouting. Most people are happy turning a deaf ear. But what if we got together to do a newspaper article? Can you imagine the headline ' between them they have lost 100 stone (or more depending on how many are involved) and all of them have reversed their diabetes' this would be eye catching. Im not sure all of us could get on the sofa with holly and phil but we could give it a whirl. And I'm not sure everyone would be happy classing it as reversal as this is a grey area. We all know that going back to the old way of eating would usually put us right back to square 1 but it would definitely grab attention more than remission! We could protest about the way diabetes is being treated currently, maybe go down the rebellious route and march on with banners demanding to speak to the PM (although i think she might have enough on her plate at the moment.....i dont know if it will be low carb food on there either even though she is diabetic!)", "\n", "\nI felt so good doing the article but then so flat at lack of feedback.", "\n", "\nHere is the gazette link so you get an idea of how little response it got.

I can't miss meals and struggle if I don't get to eat when I need to, as well as trying to manage my weight. Unfortunately I don't have an official diagnosis as the doctors have been completely useless in diagnosing anything, though they are keen to tell me it isn't diabetes. I've done finger prick blood tests which didn't seem to get any results. I've seen nutritionists who couldn't recommend anything remotely helpful other than the most basic \"try and eat healthily\" (well, obviously!), and I even did a test where I had a morning appointment with the GP who got me to drink a glucose drink before eating that day. They tell me the results don't yield anything, but the symptoms persist and it's really debilitating. I don't know what else to do. Eating healthily is difficult and expensive. I have insomnia (though very rarely do i wake up hungry). I've been advised to eat things like porridge for breakfast, but that actually makes my symptoms worse (other cereals are better - ironically as is something like a fried breakfast, but I don't have those if very very rarely for obvious reasons). I could go back to the GP but so far they've been worse than useless, and our service locally is suffering due to cuts. The first doctor i spoke to just said, in respect of managing, scoff a packet of biscuits if you're busy.

On Friday I went to collect two repeat prescription items one of which being the aforementioned needles. The Pharmacist (I collect at my doctors' practice) gave me one item and when I said that I had also requested pen needles she said that only one item had been ordered I assured her that I knew I had ordered two items. After about 10 minutes she decided to check the online system and informed me that the needles had been withdrawn, I thought she meant withdrawn from my prescription personally. I was  rather alarmed because I thought how am I going to inject without needles. What she actually meant was that this brand of needles are not going to be prescribed anymore because of cost and are being replaced by cheaper ones. Surprise. However because the person who data entered my request did not over ride the system the new needles weren't ordered. I was told that I would have to wait until next week to allow the system to be over ridden. I said this was unacceptable. Cutting a long story short I stood my ground and the pharmacist found some of my usual needles in a cupboard which she allowed me to have. My concern now is is this going to happen next time?

Bargain price. It sat in the cupboard for further 4 weeks and 8 days ago I unwrapped it. 8 days in and feeling tired but exhilarated. Sugars in range when doing so and after. I aim to post here periodically with progress. Just wondering if anyone else had tried it.

If I had been given a cast at the time when it was mainly a surface problem I think it might well have healed and would have avoided the cost of a 3 week hospital stay and countless trips to hospital by ambulance.  Even in the latter they are shortsighted because I have a locally run voluntary car and driver service which charges about 40-50p a mile and nothing for waiting time - however they will not refund the cost of that, insisting on ambulance travel (ambulancee car or minibus) which I know is many times more expensive.

I thought i would start out simple with pasta but  i am already confused the packet states allow 100g per preson of pasta, and the nutirional information states that 100g (cooked as directed) is 32.3 g carb. Does this mean that if a weigh 100g grams of dry pasta and cook that will be 31.3g of carb or is that 100g pasta cooked ! hope that makes sense.

The DN said it was the cold weather and advised stopping for a few days. I did and felt wonderful - no pain. I went back on 1x500 and on day 6 the knee pain started again with a vengeance - my lumpy knee throbs. I could barely walk on it. The doc told me to stop meds immediately. I've since been back to be told by another doc that I have a bad back and sciatica.. erm NO. It all stops when I'm off the meds. Does anyone else suffer like this please???

Basically, I was just 'sent away' by my GP and he said to change my lifestyle (easier said than done).   I am trying SO hard to lose weight as I know how important it is for my health (I am classed obese) but my concern about Fatty Liver is a) I have no idea how long I've had it - could be years the GP said and b) more concerning, how much damage (if any) has it done to my liver.

I think doctors should send diabetics for a liver scan once they are diagnosed with diabetes as a matter of routine but I guess this isn't done due to costs.   GP's should also highlight this more and explain things in more detail when you are diagnosed with diabetes, it just seems to me once you are diagnosed they just send you on your way and leave it in your hands to do something about it but don't highlight how important it is to change lifestyle.

Does anyone know how I can lower it quickly? I am in severe pain and not sleeping. I want to have the surgery by the beginning of Dec.

Do you know how long it takes for the cortisone to leave my body? I do have to say that I am very bad at watching my carbs.

In T2 also there has to have been a reason for the depletion, possibly the liver supply low so it is not being replenished in the blood fast enough. And some drugs do cause problems.

I'm on an insulin pump and I started a low carb diet a few years ago because I was struggling with binge eating disorders and high carb foods seemed to trigger it, and it really improved things for me. I had no more mood swings, stopped binge eating, felt generally healthier and my blood sugars stabilised significantly. But when I saw my consultant, he said that my basal/bolus ratio was \"wrong\" (it was around 65% basal, 35% bolus) and told me to up my bolus ratio, and drop my basal rate (despite the fact that my control had improved). As a result I started having hypos after meals, and then rebounding highs, and with the ups and downs in my blood glucose the mood swings came back and I started binge eating again. Anyway fast forward a few years of bad control (and having to come off the pump due to infections) and I've started on the pump again 3 weeks ago, my binge eating worse than ever so somehow found the willpower to give up sugary or high carb food again a few days ago. Since then my basal/bolus ratio has settled around the 65% basal 35% bolus mark again and I know my DSN is going to tell me to sort that out next time (because last time I saw her she'd commented that it was perfect at 50%:50%), but I just don't understand what the problem is if it means my blood sugars are more stable?", "\n I tried to tell my consultant the first time that I wasn't eating many carbs and surely to have a 50:50 ration I'd have to start eating more but he still wanted me to change it.", "\n", "\n Anybody else on a low carb diet have any idea what their ratio is?", "\n", "\nThanks,", "\n", "\nSarah\n\t\t\t\t\t\t", "\u00a0", "\n\t\t\t\t\t", "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI find it interesting that the doctors seem to think a 50:50 ratio is the best because surely when we all have different lifestyles with different levels of activity, different amounts of food we eat, different metabolisms and different insulin sensitivities etc, I would've thought a basal/bolus ratio couldn't possibly be a textbook number?", "\n Anyway, no shame to be had in repeating the DAFNE course, some people understand exactly what to do but still can't get it right (like myself), but did they give you the book with all of the information in it?

I\u2019m a 21 year old guy who is been training and going to gym for over 3 years and for the past two years I have been eating a lot less than my TDEE but I also ate a lot carbs but I never went below 18% body fat and this is really frustrating me but I actually know a lot of people that went to gym and in 6/12 months dropped their body fat percentage to about 10/12% so I went to get my blood tests done and my doctor said that I don\u2019t have pre diabetes or diabetes but thank to Dr. Google and Dr. YouTube, I\u2019m 100% sure I have insulin resistance because both my parents only have fat around the midsection and very skinny arms, legs and necks, with no fat at all in those places and exactly the same happened with me and I also found out that a normal diabetes test doesn\u2019t say if you are insulin resistant or not. Even if I lose weight overall, the midsection doesn\u2019t decrease unless I eat very low carbs but with the same calorie deficit, which I did for about 3 weeks and the fat from the midsection started melting away but I had to give it up because it made me feel very weak and depressed plus I do a very physical job and I need to be strong which is something that a diet high in carbs and sugar gives me but having high body fat percentages is giving major depression because I really hate the way I look. People, please help me, is there a medication I can take to decrease the insulin resistance? I\u2019m willing to start a low carb diet again and take medication that lowers insulin resistance at the same time and slowly increase the amount of carbs I eat, until I hit the point where I don\u2019t get into the fat gaining mode so that I can still lose fat around the midsection, reach low body fat percentages, have some carbs and be able to go to work.", "\n", "\n", "\nThank you for taking the time to read the post.", "\n", "\n", "\nSam.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t", "\u00a0", "\n\t\t\t\t\t"]},

I live of pasta potato rice etc. I wasn't particularly active when it came to exercise although that has changed now. This has been going on for years now tho. I recently asked GP for certain blood tests to be carried out and got back results which showed there were problems which could explain why my insulin levels were so low at one time but I think, maybe not diabetes.

I have pushed for certain tests that did come back as I expected and have been referred to a specialist in hormones and how they affect each other. Depending on the amount and types of food I have consumed during the day I adjust the amount of insulin I take at night. I am still suffering from hypos though now more than ever so I have started a better diet and exercise so I can take little if any insulin at night. When I was first diagnosed my bg was through the roof! And I have relied on insulin initially. However if more investigations were carried out at the time I believe that they would have found that other things were causing my insulin production and high bg levels for example the tests they are carrying out now. My GP also seemed shocked when he found out that these investigations were not carried out at the time either. Especially as I got the diagnosis at a relatively unusual age and at a time when I was extremely fit and healthy. If I am honest I have never believed I had type 1 diabetes so never learned much about it. I thought I was type 2 at worst. However I put that down to myself being in denial. I did the research myself and looked at how I could find out. My GP has been very supportive and informative.

This is what the recent tests are for. I am and have always questioned my type 1 diagnosis due to the lack of insulin I've had to take over the yrs. As hormones tend to have a knock on effect to each other I have raised the question of type 1 with my GP. He has said it needs to be spoken about with the specialist when I see him / her. As for everything you just mentioned. Because diabetes has had such a minimal impact on my life during the 15yrs of diagnosis I ve really not educated myself in it, just going for tests etc when requested! Never chased up results and as they've never come looking for me I am assuming things were ok. Poor attitude I know but I hate diabetes as it had such a massive effect on my prospects once I was initially diagnosed. For example I was out of the RAF On 6mths compassionate leave / discharge and got diagnosed 1 month before re entering which prevented me re enlisting! Gutted. Also any other jobs that interested me back then we're all impossible to do with a type 1 diagnosis. So although it's had no long term effect on my life it damaged the bigger initial part of me and my future massively. So I am totally un educated in tests, results, types of insulin and jargon.

Both pancreas holiday and lower GLUT4 numbers would explain a period of apparent insulin resistance after a period of low carbing.", "\n", "\nVersion 3.", "\nThis relates to the liver and its habit of releasing glucose in response to cortisol.

She said that it takes 7 days for Tresiba to be fully in its groove/ pattern, whereas with Lantus is it 3. It's also less flexible when one has active vs non-active days (relevant for a teenager: my son)! That said, he can be more flexible about when in the day he gives injections (no dead set time), which would be a positive. It's only recently been licensed for under 18 age and seems harder to get hold of for pharmacists than Lantus is (consultant's prescription needed) as a downside and I also hear it can cause crashing headaches. So I'm slightly worried about the newness of the drug - what do people think? I don't want to cause any risk to my son. That said, I read that Lantus is potentially carcinogenic, so what do you do? I have to be honest, I'm also nervous of changing the drugs. We've been living with T1 since November 2016 and so are relatively new to it.

Although from what I've read on the net, a hiatal hernia also causes the same symptoms I have and they have found I have one... although I don't know its size exactly.  I do know it's big enough to fit egg and toast in it though.  I only know this as I had a gastric emptying study done about a year ago... that's where they get you to eat egg & toast with a bit of radiation stuff in it to track it with the scanning machine.  They scan you periodically over 4 hours.  My test showed problems in the first 2 hours of the test... although this wasn't reported on because they were only looking for the outcome after 4 hours and my test came out normal... 96% of my stomach had emptied.  So that means they don't consider I have gastroparesis.  After the first hour though the egg and toast was balled up in my chest.  I had 4 technicians in the room and they asked me twice whether or not I had ever had gastric banding done.  I answered 'no'.... goodness I should know that one right?  But then they showed me why.... the screen showed the food balled up in my lower chest... exactly where I get the pain and nausea.  Then at the 2 hour mark they found something else abnormal... my food was balled up in the top of my stomach... where I get pain.  Even though this test was a year ago... unfortunately they weren't bright enough to pick up that they were actually looking at a hernia.  My pain and symptoms haven't really changed.  Now that I know I have one... it makes sense why they asked me if I had gastric banding done because what they were looking at was actually my stomach in my chest and the diaphram wall going over the top of it so it would've looked like a band to them.

And I can still burp my food and water back up too.  So you're starting to burp too?  I timed my burping was every 8 seconds when I'm really bad.  I've pretty much been burping bad since end of 2009, before then it was pain and reflux.  At times I burp so hard that it triggers hiccups and I have both at the same time... usually happens in the middle of the day when I'm at work too.  I figure keeping my mouth shut will help elleviate the sound a bit, but it doesn't really.... people can still tell I'm burping and I often get the unwanted comment or two and stares.    I have been off my pills before and the pain does get worse for me too... but I have the pain when I'm taking pills too... but more like cramps and spasms mainly.

I have burped every day and night since end of 2009 and I actually think it could be causing the oesophagal and throat spasms I periodically get.... usually smack in the early hours of the morning and it's pretty scary.  If I don't burp for a bit I get heart palpitations usually (and sometimes whilst talking)... probably the gas building up I suppose.  I've also noticed that there is pressure near my voice box... hurts to talk sometimes, although more so if I've had a spasm.  But with diabetes management I find that it can be hard to get BGLs predictable at all.  I think my food doesn't even start to digest until 3 hours after I've eaten or so.

Anyways they never told me to check my blood glucose level with any meter or urine for that matter so I though everything was hunk dory nothing to worry about I was doing fine.  Out of curiosity just for my own piece of mind and to see how I was doing I got some urine testing strips and they were showing fine results even after I started the metformin.

I put the strip against the container color chart and there are 3 +++'s and after 40 seconds its as dark and the indicator for 4 ++++'s . Now being new to all of this and not being told i should test can anyone tell me if these results on the testing strips are something to worry about? I'm not due to go back to the Dr's for a test or check up until mid January.

Yet, every day, I suffer from blurred vision to both near and far sight. Advice from members has suggested that this may vary according to my blood sugar levels yet I cannot determine this because, on the whole, I have good control. From waking my eyes are encrusted and very dry with the worst blurring occurring for at least an hour. I often have sore eyes - you know the feeling when hair shampoo gets into the eyes or as if grains of sand have been blown into them. Vision (testing left and right eyes separately) is frustrating; sometimes I can see captions on the television screen clearly with one eye but not the other or vice versa. The same with reading (I wear bi-focals) when sometimes I can read a newspaper clearly and at other times I need a magnifying glass to assist because vision has become out of focus. I instinctively feel that I do not have a serious problem because I have moments of clarity in either eye or when reading or looking at a distance. My glasses have had their prescription changed recently - the consultation almost drove the technician crazy because I could not make up my mind due to varying levels of clarity or blurredness. Without travelling to another country, e.g., Singapore, I cannot get the finest specialists to give me an opinion.

I rang the surgery for my blood results and they said they were normal. This week I have still felt ill and been really hungry and thirsty. The surgery sent me a letter to make an appointment regarding my blood test. When I rang they said that my hba1c is 79.2 and to make an appointment. Last night at work I felt even worse and my blood sugar reading was 28.1. I rang the emergency number for doctor who saw me straight away. he tested my urine as he said if there were ketones present I was being admitted to the acute medical ward. he said there were ketones but just between a trace and negative so he tripled my metformin (to 3 x 500mg a day) and told me to go the GP this morning to get blood cultures done. I went to the GP this morning who told me I was poorly controlling my diabetes and he wouldn't need bloods done I would be tired as that's what happens when it is poorly controlled and that I need to write a diary of what I eat. I eat healthily and exercise a little (walk to work and dog walks). I was diagnosed following an operation in January 2011 at 38 years old. My sister is type 1 diagnosed at 5 and my brother is type 1 diagnosed at 25.

She is currently still in hospital, is not eating and is constantly being sick and vomiting bile and has been for at least three weeks. We have now found that the Diabetic experts, at one point, stopped giving her her insulin but then restarted it but on a different type. Mum was originally on Novamix, 10 units twice a day and we were reasonably in control and no vomiting. Now it looks as though my mum is on the point of death due to a twisted knee. Her insulin has been changed for a slow acting one. The last reading I saw was 11.something  before breakfast in a morning and the nurse admits mum has not eaten anything for days and is still vomiting. Obviously, if she is constantly feeling sick she will not want to eat. But we cannot get any definite answers from the staff - just fobbed off and told its her own fault as she won't eat. Mum is also diagnosed with advanced dementia and has been T2 diabetic for about forty years. She has also received numerous injuries and skin tears at the hospital  - one extremely nasty one had an elastoplast over but it was left flapping off and a very nasty open wound exposed.  Why do hospital mess around and 'fix what wasn't broken' - making people that do not understand anymore what is happening to them and leaving in a worse state than they were in before they were admitted? Her blood sugars appear to be all over the place and they test her blood at stupid o clock - i.e. on numerous occasions at 11:45 at nights - they do not feed her in the manner she is fed at home so she is not getting regular intakes of food and if a carer is not there to feed her the food is just removed without being touched - we have queried this and have been told it is because the night staff do it and sometimes they don't get around to it. At home her sugar is tested between 07:30 and 08:30 and in the evening between 16:00 and 17:00 and she eats regularly with regular snacks.", "\nAdditionally, why oh why do Diabetic patients not have a sign or notification over their bed ( a picture would do) mum has a blue butterfly to indicate dementia (I had to push for that too) so would a picture of a bee or a cupcake be a good indication - this would enable the person taking the tea trolley round to see at a glance NOT TO PUT SUGAR IN HER TEA!!!! We have this problem every time the tea trolley comes round in our presence so it must be happening when we aren't there too We actually sued in 2011 and do not want to go down that route again - the hospital admitted liability that time but all I really want is for elderly, confused diabetics to receive the correct treatment and to not end up coming out of hospitals in a worse state than they went in.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t", "\u00a0", "\n\t\t\t\t\t", "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI have been living with her for seven years now Christine - my hubby still lives at our house, we look after mum between ourselves and we pay carers to sit with her whilst I go to work (shifts and full time) - we are also paying the carers to sit at hospital with her but they are only working the days they would normally work so I go in myself when I am on my (fluctuating) Rest Days.

We have been told that there is a list in the tea making room so 1) how can the tea lady (who vary every day) remember a whole ward of who is diabetic and who isn't and 2) if they have a list why don't they have it with them so they don't have to ask or even refer to it so they don't have to ask and 3) wouldn't it be easier all round to just put a little picture to represent 'diabetic' over the bed so the tea lady wouldn't need to refer to lists or ask or put sugar in diabetics tea which is obviouslyhappening?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t", "\u00a0", "\n\t\t\t\t\t", "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThanks  bopeep,  I told them that she certainly did not receive the injuries at home and as we have a carer agency who provide carers all the time I am at work and district nurses in twice a day, all her ailments and any form of injury is logged at home so I know  I am well covered there! I think they are tryiong to blame the previous hospital but she was only in there for one night. The did do a body chart and I noticed there was a large mark on the back of her upper thigh marked on it - I couldn't see the injury obviously as she was laid inbed but that was the only mark I have seen on the body charts. Last night when I went they had sat mum in a chair but I was shocked to see she was so bent over that her head was almost touching her knees and she couldn't straighten up. She now has both feet bandaged up. Mum swears like a trooper. now. It doesn't bother us as we know it is all part of the dementia and she always hated swearing. Mum was also complaining that her back hurt but two nirses just oiked her up and dumped her on the bed. I have already been in touch with Social Services Safeguarding. We were approached on New Years Eve by another patient who told us they could hear mother screaming on a  night when the nurses go in. She does scream a lot a home. Very sad for an intelligent lady to end up like this - I don't really understand why mums BM is very high when she is barely eating a thing. and if her sugar is haywire we know that can slso affect her personality. We also don't understand why they test her blood sugar at times like quarter to twelve at night and half five in a morning and then not again until the evening. Potty. We no longer have a clue what type of insulin she is on - if any. The care agency boss went in to see her last weekend and tried to ask the nrse what was going on but the nurse just said she didn't know and hadn't got mums records handy or somethng like that. Funnily enough even the nasty nurse say sthat mum is always quiet when I am there - to me that tells me that she feels safer when she has someone with her.  Off to work now and then straight to hospital tonight. Thank you to everyone for your support. and kindness = It does help to get things and worries off your chest\n\t\t\t\t\t\t", "\u00a0", "\n\t\t\t\t\t", "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThanks everyone. Just to update. We had a meeting yesterday. I am now looking for a nursing home as I have been told thatmum is now unable to even sit up and she is not suitable to go in a hoist as she no longer has the capacity to understand that they are llifting her. I went in on Monday night, I was a bit late leaving work so dashed n to let the dogs out for a minute then dashed up to the hospital arriving about thirty minutes later that usual - mum was on a chaior and alone in her room. Bent double with her heasd almost on her knees and her arms just hanging almost to the floor. I got down and said what on earth is happening? she just said my back hurts. With that a nurse and an auxilary came in and the nurse snapped - thats how she wants to sit. Then they grabbed her a side each and slung her on the bed. The they quite roughky threw her legs up and proceeded to change her pants, they were shouting telling her wa=hat they were doing but mum can't hear unless you get up close to her ear and she was screaming that her back hurt and fighting them. The nurse had a right go at me. The follwong day I went in and it was a different nurse and she was very nice. Both mum's legs bandaged up to the knees and she was slumped over to a side and looked very uncomfortable. She was upset and angry - she doesn't lknow what is happening part from they are hurting her. Her left thigh was a lot fatter than her right although it was the right that she had the twisted knee. Followong the meeting at the hosptial yesterdaya nd even though I have full and lasting power of attourney I am told I would need 2, possibly three carers 24/7 and would most likely have to ger up every two hours during the night tio turn her.Our care agency do not provided care to that extent and I am told mum is now totlally bedridden and can't even sit up unaided. The morla of the stroyis do NOT get old or get dementia or twist your knee. I still don't know what is happening with her insulin apart from she has lost loads of weight - I was told she is now on HumanI but they might put her back on Novamix (Which she was on in the first place with no problems) I am heart broken to think that I wanted to care for mum and have done for eight years now and this has all happened to her because she slipped and twisted her knee and at that point she could sit up and move around with her wlking frame. Even the dog is missing her and keeps going and putting her head on mums shoulder wrap. I have spoken to Safeguarding and they are taking the case up. Even if it's too late for mum - we may be able to help someone else.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t", "\u00a0", "\n\t\t\t\t\t", "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThanks you Bopeep12300 and 2Christine - although I have never met either of you you have been so lovely and I really do appreciate your kind words and support. The Safeguarding people are going in tomorrow. Mum was very weak tonight. I sang to her again. If the nurses don't like me sinigng they can go whistle. I must admit I barely slept last night. I really wanted mum to spend her last years at home but I really don't know how I can do it now she is so bad.  I was looking  for homes - I have been trawling the internet but I have to find ones that do nursing and dementia care. I am looking for one as near as possible to home so that I will be able to go in and I have told them that if there is any improvement in her I am having her back home even if I have to kidnap her.  ", "\nMy dad died at home 2Christine - 2001. I was not actually here when he died but he just sat in his favopurite chair, mum said she would just answer the phone then get him his tea and he said Okay and went she finished on the phone he was gone. I came round and sat with him and my daughter did  too, she had just turned 14, and we said goodbye to him. My daughter idolised him and she was the apple of his eye so it was nice in a way. My daughter spent a lot of time with her 'grumps' and grandma and is terribly upset at how mum has been treated.", "\nI am working late shifts now until Tuesday so my husband weil have to do the visiting.

This research was born out of an encounter I had with a patient a few weeks ago who mentioned to me that he was diabetic and was being offered all sorts of food (like cake and juice) that he thought completely inappropriate in the management of his diabetes. In my hospital, this is how it works: you get a menu that you can chose from (nowhere is there any indication of the glycaemic index on the menu) then that goes to the catering staff who know absolutely nothing about your medical history.  If you're good at managing your diabetes, and if there happen to be diabetes-appropriate options and if the catering staff stick strictly to what you ordered, this works fine.  But you can see that there's a lot of 'ifs' in that sentence.  So the idea was to sound out the patients and nurses in my hospital to try to find out where things were going wrong when this was the case and how practice can be improved.  To that end, if would be useful to know if there were an NHS hospital in the UK were diets were managed better so that I had a standard to which a comparison might be made.", "\nHana DR: thanks very much for your post.  I was particularly interested to read that your hospital had a little \"D\" on the menu (that is not the case in my hospital and was actually a simple measure that I thought might be appropriate - though I hear what your saying about the fact that the D may in fact be misplaced).  May I ask what hospital you are referring to?", "\nSid Bonkers: enormous thanks for your post - I really appreciated it.  Firstly I wanted to apologise if my choice of language was/is inappropriate/patronising.  I really did not mean to offend.  And I can completely understand that my bringing up this issue may seem fairly na\u00efve. I also totally take on board the notion that there is no such thing as one sole diabetic diet.  Patients in my hospital do receive a choice on their menu and options will be marked as V (vegetarian), Hallal, contains nuts, milk gluten free etc... and some of these options must be more appropriate in general terms than others for patients with diabetes.  That said, I'm aware that this may well sound rather paternalistic of me.  My idea here was not to try to remove choice from those who manage their diabetes well but to help guide those who, for example, are newly diagnosed.  I hope that does not sound to condescending, I assure you it is not meant as such.", "\n", "\nThanks very much again to you all.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t", "\u00a0", "\n\t\t\t\t\t"]},

Would this affect the readings?", "\n", "\nI'm not sure how concerned I should be regarding the elevated FBG level and whether I should invest in a BG monitor to start checking whether there is a major problem or wait until after the OGTT for which there is a waiting list and I got the impression it could be 6-8 weeks before that happens.", "\n", "\nI have never had any diabetes symptoms or anything I could vaguely connect to blood sugar problems.

Your advice to get her to hospital was spot on. Turns out she had an infection and was immediately given two doses of strong antibiotic through iv, along with iv fluids. After day and half in hospital level came down to low 200 and we brought her home at 10pm last night. She was given info on diet and told no more than 40 carbs per meal.

This continued for year until end. My question is...when my brother would go on he was immediately put on iv insulin and usually ended up staying 5 days before levels were under control. When my mom went in just 3 days ago, they immediately did iv fluids, but never once did the doctors even talk about using iv insulin. They just treated the infection and did not seem concerned at all that sugar levels stayed high 200's - 360 while being treated . in fact i had to show them the sliding scale for number of insulin units avcording to each blood reading. It's been a year since my  brother's experience,  but have ideas changed about how to treat high levels? When she went in with dka in august she was treated with iv insulin whereas my brother was always treated with iv even though not dka. Any ideas?

Bediol (", "http://www.bedrocan.nl/english/products/bediol.html", ") which contains appr 6.3% THC and appr 8% CBD, would be available to UK users if the ban on importation was lifted. I have discussed my cannabis use with my diabetic doctor when attending clinics and the response i have received thus far is it cannot be controlled or regulated which is complete and utter nonsense. I personally feel that the issues regarding cannabis have always been directed at campaigns of scaremongering which has allowed pharmaceticals to maintain a massive cash cow from diabetic patients which generally increase overtime due to more and more insulin being needed, if this could help your body to stop attacking its own B cells would you not like to help your body help itself or would rather continue to replace what it fails to produce. a simple analogy to make this clearer is to look at your pancreas like a bathtub and your insulin as the water which fills that bathtub, if a bathtub has a hole in it would you continue to keep filling it with water as the hole grow's larger and larger or would you look to try and fix the hole. Im not saying that CBD will cure Diabetes but i have an overwhelming amount of scientific research to suggest that it may modulate your immune system in a way which slows down the attack of the b cells in your body allowing it a chance to repair itself somewhat and reduce the dependance on pharmaceutical medications which make your body feel like a machine rather than living breathing organism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t", "\u00a0", "\n\t\t\t\t\t", "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t", "\n\t", "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t", "rharding93 said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t", "\u2191", "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t", "\n\t\t\n\t\t", "Hi Pete,", "\n", "\nI know this is an old thread but I wondered what your experience was using CBD?", "\n", "\nI've been type 1 for 12 years and am about to start using CBD oil.

I have drug induced Type 2 and was okay on diet and excercise having tried metformin but it didn't suit.  My fasting blood sugar is under 7 although after eating it can get up to 13.  I now have high levels of ketones after eating my evening meal.  My Dr tells me that ketones should only be there if you are starving yourself and this is not the case as is shown by the steep rise in blood sugar levels.  It apparently means that no glucose is being taken from the bloodstream and I either have to take diamicron at a very low dose or go straight onto insulin.  Now for the but....the literature says that it is not safe and is contraindicated to take diamicron with high levels of ketones.  'hopefully it will be safe to take a low dose as you are not fully ketone acidotic' wasn't quite what I wanted to hear.  I have been offered no reason why I have ketones after eating but Dr agrees that it needs sorting and quickly.  I have an appointment with an endocrinologist but not for another 6 weeks.  Has anyone else had this complication and can offer any advice.

As I am hours away from an A&E I am sure my GP would be the port of call but not knowing what the serious symptoms I would need to look out for in the first place I will just have to wait 6 weeks to see the endocrinologist.
