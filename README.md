# Requirements from Unstructured Text

This repository presents the code source of first step of the project **Requirements from Unstructured Text**. 

I started the project **Requirements from Unstructured Text** during my 2019 summer internship. The goal of this project is to find needs expressed in unstructured conversations and mapped them to software requirements. 

The first goals of this project are listed below:

- 1 Be able to identify needs in unstructured text.
- 1.1 Be able to identify if a sentence expresses a need.
- 1.1.1 Create a datasets with sentences labelled to 0 and 1. 1: indicating that the sentence expresses a need and 0: any other sentence.
- 1.1.2 Separate the datasets in a training set and a test set
- 1.1.3 Train a classifier on the datasets.
- 1.2 Be able to identify the need in a sentence that expresses a need.

The final project's code can be found under the folder `jh-summer19/project`.
