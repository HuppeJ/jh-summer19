# Week 9: 19-07-01--19-06-04

## Good articles 

- NLP's ImageNet moment has arrived: http://ruder.io/nlp-imagenet/
- Generalized Language Models: https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2019/01/31/generalized-language-models.html
- The Illustrated BERT, ELMo, and co. (How NLP Cracked Transfer Learning): http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/

## Monday

- Fête du Canada
  
## Tuesday

- Sumy source code: http://pydoc.net/sumy/0.4.1/sumy.parsers.plaintext/

DONE : 

- Searched and read about summarization of emails
- Implemented script to compute different summarization techniques on threads conversation (the script generates multiple summaries of different length at once)
- Implemented script to calculate the ROUGE scores for each summary generated

TODO : 

- Finish running the scripts 
- Create graphs to visualize the data

## Wednesday

DONE :

- Created summaries using lexrank, sumbasic and textrank
- Rouge-2 and rouge-3 scores has been calculated for each summaries
- Investigated the summary data
  
TODO : 

- Fix the parsing of sentences
- Rerun summarization & scores
- Report the data process (everything all options considered)
- Get statistics
  - Average of the nb. of sentences in thread
  - Number of words per sentences distribution for dataset 1 and summary dataset
- Designing our own summarizer for requirement statements
  
## Thursday

DONE :

- Started creating **sentence** summaries using lexrank, sumbasic and textrank
- Fixed the parsing of sentences
- Set up the school computers to have more computer power and get the summaries faster
- Looked into ideas for the requirement summarizer
- Started plan for the end of the summer 2019
   
TODO : 

- Report the data process (everything all options considered)
- Get statistics
  - Average of the nb. of sentences in thread
  - Number of words per sentences distribution for dataset 1 and summary dataset
- Design our own summarizer for requirement statements

- Variations of the Similarity Function of TextRank for Automated Summarization: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.03606.pdf
  
DONE :

- Finished creating summaries datasets using lexrank & sumbasic algo
- Looked into ideas for the requirement summarizer
- Continued plan for the end of the summer 2019
- Read/Learned the implementation of LexRank Algorithm
- Adjusted the LexRank Algorithm provided by Gensim to get summaries of different sentences length faster

TODO :

- Report the data process (everything all options considered)
- Get statistics
  - Average of the nb. of sentences in thread
  - Number of words per sentences distribution for dataset 1 and summary dataset
