# Week 5: 19-06-03 to 19-06-07

## Monday

- Worked on existing notebook example of supervised learning for classifying text, see Exercise6_Concrete_NLP_Tutorial_Adapted

### **Plan for the week**

#### 1) Mapping requirements sentences with keywords

##### 1.1) Manual mapping of requirements sentences

- [ - ] Adapt the script to get the question, the answers and the info about the user
- [ x ] Extract 10 questions with answers randomly
  - [ x ] Put the questions in separated files
  - [ ~ ] Highlight the requirements text
  - [ ~ ] Retrieve the requirements keywords from the questions
- [ x ] Create a list of requirements keywords in a csv file
  - [ x ] Find synonym of keywords with a dictionary to add to the csv file
  - [ x ] Lemmatize all the keywords in the dictionary

##### 1.2) Automatic mapping of requirements sentences

- [ x ] Import keywords from csv file
- [ x ] Define a clear parsing algorithm for the forum text
  - [ ~ ] Lemmatize word before checking if it matches a requirements keyword

#### 2) How many posts and comments per topic & totals

- [ x ] Get the number of posts and comments per topic & totals

#### 3) # of active users per topic

- [ - ] Get a super list of all users
- [ - ] Get the # of comments per user

#### 4) Review papers

- [ - ] Paper 1
- [ - ] Paper 2
