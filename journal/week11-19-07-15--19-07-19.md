# Week 10: 19-07-15--19-07-19

## Monday

DONE:

- Reran all the scripts with all punctuation kept
- Removed the script to update the sample mturk dataset no. 1 (10500 sentences) properly so that the summarization are consistent with this dataset. We will have to rerun the summarization algorithm to be sure the data is consistent.
- Researched about how to update the HTML layout with example requirement sentences on the main page. [ Conclusion ]: The layout of the Crowd HTML Elements are not customizable so we can't cleanly add requirement sentences on the main page.
- Researched about how to put multiple questions in one HIT. [ Conclusion ]: Didn't find an option that says: "Put X number of question in each HIT". Didn't find anything conclusive concerning how to add multiple questions in one HIT properly.

TODO:

- Rerun all the statistics on the new datasets
- Submit to mturk
- Design summarizer for requirement statements

## Tuesday

DONE:

- Updated File History Graph
- Update File_Evolution file
- Backed up all the data
- Created new sample_dataset_mturk_no2
- Summarized threads of sample_dataset_mturk_no2 with lexrank for summaries of 20 sentences
- Reran and updated script with statistics 
- Continued research about how to put multiple questions in one HIT
  - I might have found something that will work with some Javascript parsing and a restructure of the input csv file.
  - An other option might be to use the mturk API.
