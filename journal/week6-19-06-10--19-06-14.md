# Week 6: 19-06-10 to 19-06-14

## Monday

- Finished the script for scraping threads (had a lot of exceptions to consider)
- Started scraping threads (*Encountered a problem*: I was wondering if it would happen and yes it did... We can't scrape too much data at the same time, after a certain amount of pages scraped we get rate-limited and it takes forever to finish scraping the data. Because of this problem, I only have less than 5% of the desired data)
  
## Tuesday

- Continued scraping data: Found an alternative technique to scrape faster: it takes more manual work, but it scrapes pages faster^^ (I still have a bit of data to scrape)
- Encountered problems while scraping the data and fixed them
- Created script to format scraped data in csv files
- Found potential script for finding interrogative sentences
  
## Wednesday

- Continued scraping data (Almost finished)
- Started compiling the data between the two computer I used
- Going to an event with IVADO at the end of the afternoon
  
## Thursday

- Researched on tools to find interrogative sentences
- Researched on POS and Sentence Structure parsing 
- Structured a python project to have a more modular approach
- Created small sample datasets from the scraped data

## Friday
