# Week 6: 19-06-10 to 19-06-14

## **Plan for the week**

### 1) Scrape all the data from diabetes forum: https://www.diabetes.co.uk/forum/

- [ x ] Scrape the number of posts and comments per topic & totals
- [ x ] Scrape the subforum titles and their threads info
- [ x ] Scrape the thread's posts 
- [ x ] Scrape the source html pages for the whole website

### 2) Interrogative sentences

- [ x ] Research on tools to find interrogative sentences
  - Conclusion: There is two options:
    - **Option 1**: Use supervised learning:
      - Need a datasets of interrogative sentences vs non interrogative ones
      - Idea proposed: Find datasets with only interrogative sentences. Find datasets with non interrogative sentences. Build your own labeled datasets by combing the two. (TODO: find datasets)
      - Link 1.1: Chapter 6 section 2.2 of the NLTK book: https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/26427/how-to-extract-question-s-from-document-with-nltk
      - Link 1.2: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49100615/nltk-detecting-whether-a-sentence-is-interogative-or-not
      - Link 1.3: https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/26427/how-to-extract-question-s-from-document-with-nltk
    - **Options 2**: Use POS tagging for the whole sentence. Basically, build a grammar tree of each sentences:
      - When Stanford Core NLP parse a sentence it adds a tag to the whole sentence and categorize it in different types of sentences.

#### Notes

##### Machine learning techniques can be used with following features,  

Sentence Starting with Wh word
Sentence starting with helping verb
Subject verb inversion
Presence of question mark
Context information for cases like "What he said was more important that what he accomplished.", in which sentence starts with Wh word but it is not actually interrogative sentence.

##### Datasets of sentences classified by type

- Where can I find a datasets of sentences classified by type (interrogative, declarative. etc)? (Build your own by combining question with declarative sentences) https://www.quora.com/Where-can-I-find-a-dataset-of-sentences-classified-by-type-interrogative-declarative-etc s

##### Sentence is a question? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4083060/determine-if-a-sentence-is-an-inquiry

Finding out if a sentence is a question is not an easiest task, because there is many ways how people asks questions, many of them do not follows grammar rules. Therefore it is hard to find a good rule set for the detection. In such situations, I would go for machine learning and train an algorithm using annotated text corpus (creating a corpus and selecting a feature set can take some time). The machine learning based recognition should provide you better recall than the rule based approach. Here is a step by step instruction:

1. Manual creation of train data set: Get an annotated -- with information if it is a question or not -- text collection or create such a corpus on your own (it should be more then 100 documents and many questions must not be straightforward questions )
2. Find most important features - extract part-of-speeches, 5W1H (what, which,..., how), get a position of a verb in each of sentences, and other things that can be useful in the recognition of a question
3. Create a vector for each of sentences of features (you need both, positive and negative examples) based on the extracted information, e.g.,
| Has ? | A verb on second position | Has 5W1H | Is 5W1H on 1st position in sentence | ... | length of sentence | Is a question |
4. Use the vectors to train a machine learning algorithm, e.g., MaximumEntropy, SVM (you can use Wekka or Knime)
5. Use the trained algorithm for the question recognition.
6. If needed (new question examples), repeat steps.

### 3) Python project

- [ ~ ] Structure a scalable python project

## Monday

- Finished the script for scraping threads (had a lot of exceptions to consider)
- Started scraping threads (*Encountered a problem*: I was wondering if it would happen and yes it did... We can't scrape too much data at the same time, after a certain amount of pages scraped we get rate-limited and it takes forever to finish scraping the data. Because of this problem, I only have less than 5% of the desired data)
  
## Tuesday

- Continued scraping data: Found an alternative technique to scrape faster: it takes more manual work, but it scrapes pages faster^^ (I still have a bit of data to scrape)
- Encountered problems while scraping the data and fixed them
- Created script to format scraped data in csv files
- Found potential script for finding interrogative sentences
  
## Wednesday

- Continued scraping data (Almost finished)
- Started compiling the data between the two computer I used
- Going to an event with IVADO at the end of the afternoon
  
## Thursday

- Researched on tools to find interrogative sentences
- Researched on POS and Sentence Structure parsing 
- Structured a python project to have a more modular approach
- Created small sample datasets from the scraped data

## Friday

- Implemented new code to retrieve data from the new scraped data
- Refactored code
- Implemented POS tagging 
- Implemented TF-IDF
- TODO:
- Implement Stanford CoreNLP and see the different types of Grammar trees
- Learn and implement Association Rule Mining -> Find most frequent pattern -> See Apriori algorithm
- For more details see journal/week7... -> Plan of the week
