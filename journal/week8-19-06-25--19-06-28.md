## **Plan for the week**

## 1) Things to implement

## 2) **Ideas to explore**

- [ - ] Use title to get more info about the thread and distinguish the noisy data form the non-noisy data
- [ - ] Focus on question post and use the answer posts to bring more information
- [ - ] Find the need from the answer posts: find sentence structures that answer a need
- [ - ] Summary/Topic modeling for the whole conversation? 
- [ - ] Summary/Topic modeling for each post?
  - For now we will only use the title and see if topic modeling could help later [14/06/2019] 
  - topic-modelling-with-spacy-and-scikit-learn: https://www.kaggle.com/thebrownviking20/topic-modelling-with-spacy-and-scikit-learn
- [ - ] Consider the position of the sentence.

## 4) **Things to research and learn about**:

- [ - ] Association rule mining -> Find most frequent pattern -> See Apriori algorithm etc.
- [ - ] How to reduce noise in forum conversation?
- [ - ] What techniques are used to optimize search result based on the search query
- [ - ] Find patterns in sentences that certainly do not express a need?
