How to scrape TripAdvisor.com for Hotel Data, Pricing and Reviews using Python https://www.scrapehero.com/how-to-scrape-tripadvisor/

- Scraping Logic
    1. Construct the search results page URL from TripAdvisor – Tripadvisor has complex URL for the search results page of each locality. For example here is the one for Boston https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g60745-Boston_Massachusetts-Hotels.html. We’ll have to construct this URL manually to scrape results from that page. We do that by getting this URL from Tripadvisor autocomplete API.
    2. Download HTML of the search result page using **Python Requests** – Quite easy, once you have the URL. We use python requests to download the entire HTML of this page.
    3. Parse the page using **LXML** – LXML lets you navigate the HTML Tree Structure using Xpaths. We have predefined the XPaths for the details we need in the code.
    4. Save the data to a CSV file
    5. The code : https://gist.github.com/scrapehero/1c425fdf290144cd4c7c635587feb459

#### API

TripAdvisor Content API: https://developer-tripadvisor.com/content-api/

- Does not provide the forums data
- Need an API key
- Access to an API key is not allowed for data analysis or academic research

#### Tools 

WebHarvy: https://www.webharvy.com/articles/scraping-tripadvisor.html

- Provides “access” to Posts in TripAdvisor forums
- It is a complete software (with interface, etc.) not a library. 
- Selecting which data you want to extract is be time consuming
- Not flexible

Octoparse: https://www.octoparse.com/tutorial-7/scrape-hotel-data-from-tripadvisor

- Same as WebHarvey but software seems better
