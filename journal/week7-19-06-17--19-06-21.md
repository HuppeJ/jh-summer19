# Week 7: 19-06-17--19-06-21

## **Plan for the week**

### 1) Finalizing the organization of the scrape data

- [ - ] Update the stats on the number of posts and comments per topic & totals with the scraped data
- [ - ] Transfer the scraped source html file on the hard drive
- [ - ] Run the script to parse the json files to csv files

### 2) Things to implement

- [ - ] Implement connection to Stanford CoreNLP for parsing sentences into grammar trees
  - [ - ] ParserAnnotator: https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/parse.html
- [ - ] Learn and implement Association Rule Mining -> Find most frequent pattern -> See Apriori algorithm
- [ - ] Combining the new approaches with keywords matching
- [ - ] Try to find a good approach to use the TF-IDF scores
  - [ - ] Have a look at: Finding The Most Important Sentences Using NLP & TF-IDF https://hackernoon.com/finding-the-most-important-sentences-using-nlp-tf-idf-3065028897a3

## 3) **Ideas to explore**

- [ - ] Build our own datasets for supervised learning for categorizing interrogative vs non interrogative sentences
- [ - ] Use title to get more info about the thread and distinguish the noisy data form the non-noisy data
- [ - ] Focus on question post and use the answer posts to bring more information
- [ - ] Find the need from the answer posts: find sentence structures that answer a need
- [ - ] Topic modeling for the whole conversation? 
  - For now we will only use the title and see if topic modeling could help later [14/06/2019] 
  - topic-modelling-with-spacy-and-scikit-learn: https://www.kaggle.com/thebrownviking20/topic-modelling-with-spacy-and-scikit-learn
- [ - ] Consider the position of the sentence.

## 4) **Things to research and learn about**:

- [ - ] Association rule mining -> Find most frequent pattern -> See Apriori algorithm etc.
- [ - ] How to reduce noise in forum conversation?
- [ - ] What techniques are used to optimize search result based on the search query
- [ - ] Find patterns in sentences that certainly do not express a need?
- [ - ] Reread CLiPS: https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/pages/pattern-vector

## **Things to keep in mind**

- [ - ] Do we want to label some sentences: sentence that contains requirement vs sentence that does not contain requirement?
- [ - ] spaCy really good NLP library: https://spacy.io/
  - [ ~ ] spaCy vs NLTK: https://medium.com/@pemagrg/private-nltk-vs-spacy-3926b3674ee4
